<title>Incomplete Utterance Rewriting as Sequential Greedy Tagging. (arXiv:2307.06337v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06337</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The task of incomplete utterance rewriting has recently gotten much
attention. Previous models struggled to extract information from the dialogue
context, as evidenced by the low restoration scores. To address this issue, we
propose a novel sequence tagging-based model, which is more adept at extracting
information from context. Meanwhile, we introduce speaker-aware embedding to
model speaker variation. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that our
model achieves optimal results on all nine restoration scores while having
other metric scores comparable to previous state-of-the-art models.
Furthermore, benefitting from the model&apos;s simplicity, our approach outperforms
most previous models on inference speed.

<title>Assessment of the suitability of degradation models for the planning of CCTV inspections of sewer pipes. (arXiv:2307.06341v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06341</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The degradation of sewer pipes poses significant economical, environmental
and health concerns. The maintenance of such assets requires structured plans
to perform inspections, which are more efficient when structural and
environmental features are considered along with the results of previous
inspection reports. The development of such plans requires degradation models
that can be based on statistical and machine learning methods. This work
proposes a methodology to assess their suitability to plan inspections
considering three dimensions: accuracy metrics, ability to produce long-term
degradation curves and explainability. Results suggest that although ensemble
models yield the highest accuracy, they are unable to infer the long-term
degradation of the pipes, whereas the Logistic Regression offers a slightly
less accurate model that is able to produce consistent degradation curves with
a high explainability. A use case is presented to demonstrate this methodology
and the efficiency of model-based planning compared to the current inspection
plan.

<title>Sequential Experimental Design for X-Ray CT Using Deep Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2307.06343v1 [eess.IV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06343</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), projections from many angles are acquired
and used for 3D reconstruction. To make CT suitable for in-line quality
control, reducing the number of angles while maintaining reconstruction quality
is necessary. Sparse-angle tomography is a popular approach for obtaining 3D
reconstructions from limited data. To optimize its performance, one can adapt
scan angles sequentially to select the most informative angles for each scanned
object. Mathematically, this corresponds to solving and optimal experimental
design (OED) problem. OED problems are high-dimensional, non-convex, bi-level
optimization problems that cannot be solved online, i.e., during the scan. To
address these challenges, we pose the OED problem as a partially observable
Markov decision process in a Bayesian framework, and solve it through deep
reinforcement learning. The approach learns efficient non-greedy policies to
solve a given class of OED problems through extensive offline training rather
than solving a given OED problem directly via numerical optimization. As such,
the trained policy can successfully find the most informative scan angles
online. We use a policy training method based on the Actor-Critic approach and
evaluate its performance on 2D tomography with synthetic data.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06362</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Physically informed neural networks (PINNs) are a promising emerging method
for solving differential equations. As in many other deep learning approaches,
the choice of PINN design and training protocol requires careful craftsmanship.
Here, we suggest a comprehensive theoretical framework that sheds light on this
important problem. Leveraging an equivalence between infinitely
over-parameterized neural networks and Gaussian process regression (GPR), we
derive an integro-differential equation that governs PINN prediction in the
large data-set limit -- the Neurally-Informed Equation (NIE). This equation
augments the original one by a kernel term reflecting architecture choices and
allows quantifying implicit bias induced by the network via a spectral
decomposition of the source term in the original differential equation.

<title>Personalized Anomaly Detection in PPG Data using Representation Learning and Biometric Identification. (arXiv:2307.06380v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06380</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, typically acquired from wearable devices,
hold significant potential for continuous fitness-health monitoring. In
particular, heart conditions that manifest in rare and subtle deviating heart
patterns may be interesting. However, robust and reliable anomaly detection
within these data remains a challenge due to the scarcity of labeled data and
high inter-subject variability. This paper introduces a two-stage framework
leveraging representation learning and personalization to improve anomaly
detection performance in PPG data. The proposed framework first employs
representation learning to transform the original PPG signals into a more
discriminative and compact representation. We then apply three different
unsupervised anomaly detection methods for movement detection and biometric
identification. We validate our approach using two different datasets in both
generalized and personalized scenarios. The results show that representation
learning significantly improves anomaly detection performance while reducing
the high inter-subject variability. Personalized models further enhance anomaly
detection performance, underscoring the role of personalization in PPG-based
fitness-health monitoring systems. The results from biometric identification
show that it&apos;s easier to distinguish a new user from one intended authorized
user than from a group of users. Overall, this study provides evidence of the
effectiveness of representation learning and personalization for anomaly
detection in PPG data.

<title>Temporal Label-Refinement for Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Event Localization. (arXiv:2307.06385v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06385</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVEL) is the task of temporally localizing
and classifying \emph{audio-visual events}, i.e., events simultaneously visible
and audible in a video. In this paper, we solve AVEL in a weakly-supervised
setting, where only video-level event labels (their presence/absence, but not
their locations in time) are available as supervision for training. Our idea is
to use a base model to estimate labels on the training data at a finer temporal
resolution than at the video level and re-train the model with these labels.
I.e., we determine the subset of labels for each \emph{slice} of frames in a
training video by (i) replacing the frames outside the slice with those from a
second video having no overlap in video-level labels, and (ii) feeding this
synthetic video into the base model to extract labels for just the slice in
question. To handle the out-of-distribution nature of our synthetic videos, we
propose an auxiliary objective for the base model that induces more reliable
predictions of the localized event labels as desired. Our three-stage pipeline
outperforms several existing AVEL methods with no architectural changes and
improves performance on a related weakly-supervised task as well.

<title>Trainability, Expressivity and Interpretability in Gated Neural ODEs. (arXiv:2307.06398v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06398</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the dynamics in biological and artificial neural networks
implement the computations required for a task is a salient open question in
machine learning and neuroscience. In particular, computations requiring
complex memory storage and retrieval pose a significant challenge for these
networks to implement or learn. Recently, a family of models described by
neural ordinary differential equations (nODEs) has emerged as powerful
dynamical neural network models capable of capturing complex dynamics. Here, we
extend nODEs by endowing them with adaptive timescales using gating
interactions. We refer to these as gated neural ODEs (gnODEs). Using a task
that requires memory of continuous quantities, we demonstrate the inductive
bias of the gnODEs to learn (approximate) continuous attractors. We further
show how reduced-dimensional gnODEs retain their modeling power while greatly
improving interpretability, even allowing explicit visualization of the
structure of learned attractors. We introduce a novel measure of expressivity
which probes the capacity of a neural network to generate complex trajectories.
Using this measure, we explore how the phase-space dimension of the nODEs and
the complexity of the function modeling the flow field contribute to
expressivity. We see that a more complex function for modeling the flow field
allows a lower-dimensional nODE to capture a given target dynamics. Finally, we
demonstrate the benefit of gating in nODEs on several real-world tasks.

<title>Testing Sparsity Assumptions in Bayesian Networks. (arXiv:2307.06406v1 [stat.ML])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06406</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian network (BN) structure discovery algorithms typically either make
assumptions about the sparsity of the true underlying network, or are limited
by computational constraints to networks with a small number of variables.
While these sparsity assumptions can take various forms, frequently the
assumptions focus on an upper bound for the maximum in-degree of the underlying
graph $\nabla_G$. Theorem 2 in Duttweiler et. al. (2023) demonstrates that the
largest eigenvalue of the normalized inverse covariance matrix ($\Omega$) of a
linear BN is a lower bound for $\nabla_G$. Building on this result, this paper
provides the asymptotic properties of, and a debiasing procedure for, the
sample eigenvalues of $\Omega$, leading to a hypothesis test that may be used
to determine if the BN has max in-degree greater than 1. A linear BN structure
discovery workflow is suggested in which the investigator uses this hypothesis
test to aid in selecting an appropriate structure discovery algorithm. The
hypothesis test performance is evaluated through simulations and the workflow
is demonstrated on data from a human psoriasis study.

<title>Differentially Private Decoupled Graph Convolutions for Multigranular Topology Protection. (arXiv:2307.06422v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06422</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph learning methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on graph
convolutions, are highly successful in solving real-world learning problems
involving graph-structured data. However, graph learning methods expose
sensitive user information and interactions not only through their model
parameters but also through their model predictions. Consequently, standard
Differential Privacy (DP) techniques that merely offer model weight privacy are
inadequate. This is especially the case for node predictions that leverage
neighboring node attributes directly via graph convolutions that create
additional risks of privacy leakage. To address this problem, we introduce
Graph Differential Privacy (GDP), a new formal DP framework tailored to graph
learning settings that ensures both provably private model parameters and
predictions. Furthermore, since there may be different privacy requirements for
the node attributes and graph structure, we introduce a novel notion of relaxed
node-level data adjacency. This relaxation can be used for establishing
guarantees for different degrees of graph topology privacy while maintaining
node attribute privacy. Importantly, this relaxation reveals a useful trade-off
between utility and topology privacy for graph learning methods. In addition,
our analysis of GDP reveals that existing DP-GNNs fail to exploit this
trade-off due to the complex interplay between graph topology and attribute
data in standard graph convolution designs. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce the Differentially Private Decoupled Graph Convolution (DPDGC) model,
which benefits from decoupled graph convolution while providing GDP guarantees.
Extensive experiments on seven node classification benchmarking datasets
demonstrate the superior privacy-utility trade-off of DPDGC over existing
DP-GNNs based on standard graph convolution design.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06431</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Energy-based models are a simple yet powerful class of probabilistic models,
but their widespread adoption has been limited by the computational burden of
training them. We propose a novel loss function called Energy Discrepancy (ED)
which does not rely on the computation of scores or expensive Markov chain
Monte Carlo. We show that ED approaches the explicit score matching and
negative log-likelihood loss under different limits, effectively interpolating
between both. Consequently, minimum ED estimation overcomes the problem of
nearsightedness encountered in score-based estimation methods, while also
enjoying theoretical guarantees. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate
that ED learns low-dimensional data distributions faster and more accurately
than explicit score matching or contrastive divergence. For high-dimensional
image data, we describe how the manifold hypothesis puts limitations on our
approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of energy discrepancy by training
the energy-based model as a prior of a variational decoder model.

dropping), batch selection (selective backprop, RHO loss), and efficient
optimizers (Lion, Sophia). When pre-training BERT and T5 with a fixed
computation budget using such methods, we find that their training, validation,
and downstream gains vanish compared to a baseline with a fully-decayed
learning rate. We define an evaluation protocol that enables computation to be
done on arbitrary machines by mapping all computation time to a reference
machine which we call reference system time. We discuss the limitations of our

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study sensor/agent data collection and collaboration policies for
parameter estimation, accounting for resource constraints and correlation
between observations collected by distinct sensors/agents. Specifically, we
consider a group of sensors/agents each samples from different variables of a
multivariate Gaussian distribution and has different estimation objectives, and
we formulate a sensor/agent&apos;s data collection and collaboration policy design
problem as a Fisher information maximization (or Cramer-Rao bound minimization)
problem. When the knowledge of correlation between variables is available, we
analytically identify two particular scenarios: (1) where the knowledge of the
correlation between samples cannot be leveraged for collaborative estimation
purposes and (2) where the optimal data collection policy involves investing
scarce resources to collaboratively sample and transfer information that is not
of immediate interest and whose statistics are already known, with the sole
goal of increasing the confidence on the estimate of the parameter of interest.
When the knowledge of certain correlation is unavailable but collaboration may
still be worthwhile, we propose novel ways to apply multi-armed bandit
algorithms to learn the optimal data collection and collaboration policy in our
distributed parameter estimation problem and demonstrate that the proposed
algorithms, DOUBLE-F, DOUBLE-Z, UCB-F, UCB-Z, are effective through
simulations.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06450</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a numerical methodology for finding the closed-loop
Nash equilibrium of stochastic delay differential games through deep learning.
These games are prevalent in finance and economics where multi-agent
interaction and delayed effects are often desired features in a model, but are
introduced at the expense of increased dimensionality of the problem. This
increased dimensionality is especially significant as that arising from the
number of players is coupled with the potential infinite dimensionality caused
by the delay. Our approach involves parameterizing the controls of each player
using distinct recurrent neural networks. These recurrent neural network-based
controls are then trained using a modified version of Brown&apos;s fictitious play,
incorporating deep learning techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
methodology, we test it on finance-related problems with known solutions.
Furthermore, we also develop new problems and derive their analytical Nash
equilibrium solutions, which serve as additional benchmarks for assessing the
performance of our proposed deep learning approach.

<title>Tackling Combinatorial Distribution Shift: A Matrix Completion Perspective. (arXiv:2307.06457v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06457</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Obtaining rigorous statistical guarantees for generalization under
distribution shift remains an open and active research area. We study a setting
we call combinatorial distribution shift, where (a) under the test- and
training-distributions, the labels $z$ are determined by pairs of features
$(x,y)$, (b) the training distribution has coverage of certain marginal
distributions over $x$ and $y$ separately, but (c) the test distribution
involves examples from a product distribution over $(x,y)$ that is {not}
covered by the training distribution. Focusing on the special case where the
labels are given by bilinear embeddings into a Hilbert space $H$: $\mathbb{E}[z
\mid x,y ]=\langle f_{\star}(x),g_{\star}(y)\rangle_{{H}}$, we aim to
extrapolate to a test distribution domain that is $not$ covered in training,
i.e., achieving bilinear combinatorial extrapolation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our setting generalizes a special case of matrix completion from
missing-not-at-random data, for which all existing results require the
ground-truth matrices to be either exactly low-rank, or to exhibit very sharp
spectral cutoffs. In this work, we develop a series of theoretical results that
enable bilinear combinatorial extrapolation under gradual spectral decay as
observed in typical high-dimensional data, including novel algorithms,
generalization guarantees, and linear-algebraic results. A key tool is a novel
perturbation bound for the rank-$k$ singular value decomposition approximations
between two matrices that depends on the relative spectral gap rather than the
absolute spectral gap, a result that may be of broader independent interest.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Automated classifiers (ACs), often built via supervised machine learning
(SML), can categorize large, statistically powerful samples of data ranging
from text to images and video, and have become widely popular measurement
devices in communication science and related fields. Despite this popularity,
even highly accurate classifiers make errors that cause misclassification bias
and misleading results in downstream analyses-unless such analyses account for
these errors. As we show in a systematic literature review of SML applications,
communication scholars largely ignore misclassification bias. In principle,
existing statistical methods can use &quot;gold standard&quot; validation data, such as
that created by human annotators, to correct misclassification bias and produce
consistent estimates. We introduce and test such methods, including a new
method we design and implement in the R package misclassificationmodels, via
Monte Carlo simulations designed to reveal each method&apos;s limitations, which we
also release. Based on our results, we recommend our new error correction
method as it is versatile and efficient. In sum, automated classifiers, even
those below common accuracy standards or making systematic misclassifications,
can be useful for measurement with careful study design and appropriate error
correction methods.

<title>Microbial Genetic Algorithm-based Black-box Attack against Interpretable Deep Learning Systems. (arXiv:2307.06496v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06496</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep learning models are susceptible to adversarial samples in white and
black-box environments. Although previous studies have shown high attack
success rates, coupling DNN models with interpretation models could offer a
sense of security when a human expert is involved, who can identify whether a
given sample is benign or malicious. However, in white-box environments,
interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes) have been shown to be vulnerable
to malicious manipulations. In black-box settings, as access to the components
of IDLSes is limited, it becomes more challenging for the adversary to fool the
system. In this work, we propose a Query-efficient Score-based black-box attack
against IDLSes, QuScore, which requires no knowledge of the target model and
its coupled interpretation model. QuScore is based on transfer-based and
score-based methods by employing an effective microbial genetic algorithm. Our
method is designed to reduce the number of queries necessary to carry out
successful attacks, resulting in a more efficient process. By continuously
refining the adversarial samples created based on feedback scores from the
IDLS, our approach effectively navigates the search space to identify
perturbations that can fool the system. We evaluate the attack&apos;s effectiveness
on four CNN models (Inception, ResNet, VGG, DenseNet) and two interpretation
models (CAM, Grad), using both ImageNet and CIFAR datasets. Our results show
that the proposed approach is query-efficient with a high attack success rate
that can reach between 95% and 100% and transferability with an average success
rate of 69% in the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets. Our attack method generates
adversarial examples with attribution maps that resemble benign samples. We
have also demonstrated that our attack is resilient against various
preprocessing defense techniques and can easily be transferred to different DNN
models.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06501</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Objective: The artificial pancreas (AP) has shown promising potential in
achieving closed-loop glucose control for individuals with type 1 diabetes
mellitus (T1DM). However, designing an effective control policy for the AP
remains challenging due to the complex physiological processes, delayed insulin
response, and inaccurate glucose measurements. While model predictive control
(MPC) offers safety and stability through the dynamic model and safety
constraints, it lacks individualization and is adversely affected by
unannounced meals. Conversely, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides
personalized and adaptive strategies but faces challenges with distribution
shifts and substantial data requirements. Methods: We propose a hybrid control
policy for the artificial pancreas (HyCPAP) to address the above challenges.
HyCPAP combines an MPC policy with an ensemble DRL policy, leveraging the
strengths of both policies while compensating for their respective limitations.
To facilitate faster deployment of AP systems in real-world settings, we
further incorporate meta-learning techniques into HyCPAP, leveraging previous
experience and patient-shared knowledge to enable fast adaptation to new
patients with limited available data. Results: We conduct extensive experiments
using the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova T1DM simulator across three scenarios. Our
approaches achieve the highest percentage of time spent in the desired
euglycemic range and the lowest occurrences of hypoglycemia. Conclusion: The
results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our methods for closed-loop
glucose management in individuals with T1DM. Significance: The study presents
novel control policies for AP systems, affirming the great potential of
proposed methods for efficient closed-loop glucose control.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06513</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Beliefs and values are increasingly being incorporated into our AI systems
through alignment processes, such as carefully curating data collection
principles or regularizing the loss function used for training. However, the
meta-alignment problem is that these human beliefs are diverse and not aligned
across populations; furthermore, the implicit strength of each belief may not
be well calibrated even among humans, especially when trying to generalize
across contexts. Specifically, in high regret situations, we observe that
contextual counterfactuals and recourse costs are particularly important in
updating a decision maker&apos;s beliefs and the strengths to which such beliefs are
held. Therefore, we argue that including counterfactuals is key to an accurate
calibration of beliefs during alignment. To do this, we first segment belief
diversity into two categories: subjectivity (across individuals within a
population) and epistemic uncertainty (within an individual across different
contexts). By leveraging our notion of epistemic uncertainty, we introduce `the
belief calibration cycle&apos; framework to more holistically calibrate this
diversity of beliefs with context-driven counterfactual reasoning by using a
multi-objective optimization. We empirically apply our framework for finding a
Pareto frontier of clustered optimal belief strengths that generalize across
different contexts, demonstrating its efficacy on a toy dataset for credit
decisions.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning (ML) systems, particularly when deployed in high-stakes
domains, are deeply consequential. They can exacerbate existing inequities,
create new modes of discrimination, and reify outdated social constructs.
Accordingly, the social context (i.e. organisations, teams, cultures) in which
ML systems are developed is a site of active research for the field of AI
ethics, and intervention for policymakers. This paper focuses on one aspect of
social context that is often overlooked: interactions between practitioners and
the tools they rely on, and the role these interactions play in shaping ML
practices and the development of ML systems. In particular, through an
empirical study of questions asked on the Stack Exchange forums, the use of
interactive computing platforms (e.g. Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab) in ML
practices is explored. I find that interactive computing platforms are used in
a host of learning and coordination practices, which constitutes an
infrastructural relationship between interactive computing platforms and ML
practitioners. I describe how ML practices are co-evolving alongside the
development of interactive computing platforms, and highlight how this risks
making invisible aspects of the ML life cycle that AI ethics researchers&apos; have
demonstrated to be particularly salient for the societal impact of deployed ML
systems.

<title>Artificial Intelligence for Drug Discovery: Are We There Yet?. (arXiv:2307.06521v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06521</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Drug discovery is adapting to novel technologies such as data science,
informatics, and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate effective treatment
development while reducing costs and animal experiments. AI is transforming
drug discovery, as indicated by increasing interest from investors, industrial
and academic scientists, and legislators. Successful drug discovery requires
optimizing properties related to pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and
clinical outcomes. This review discusses the use of AI in the three pillars of
drug discovery: diseases, targets, and therapeutic modalities, with a focus on
small molecule drugs. AI technologies, such as generative chemistry, machine
learning, and multi-property optimization, have enabled several compounds to
enter clinical trials. The scientific community must carefully vet known
information to address the reproducibility crisis. The full potential of AI in
drug discovery can only be realized with sufficient ground truth and
appropriate human intervention at later pipeline stages.

<title>DSV: An Alignment Validation Loss for Self-supervised Outlier Model Selection. (arXiv:2307.06534v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06534</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven effective in solving various
problems by generating internal supervisory signals. Unsupervised anomaly
detection, which faces the high cost of obtaining true labels, is an area that
can greatly benefit from SSL. However, recent literature suggests that tuning
the hyperparameters (HP) of data augmentation functions is crucial to the
success of SSL-based anomaly detection (SSAD), yet a systematic method for
doing so remains unknown. In this work, we propose DSV (Discordance and
Separability Validation), an unsupervised validation loss to select
high-performing detection models with effective augmentation HPs. DSV captures
the alignment between an augmentation function and the anomaly-generating
mechanism with surrogate losses, which approximate the discordance and
separability of test data, respectively. As a result, the evaluation via DSV
leads to selecting an effective SSAD model exhibiting better alignment, which
results in high detection accuracy. We theoretically derive the degree of
approximation conducted by the surrogate losses and empirically show that DSV
outperforms a wide range of baselines on 21 real-world tasks.

<title>Tensor Decompositions Meet Control Theory: Learning General Mixtures of Linear Dynamical Systems. (arXiv:2307.06538v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06538</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recently Chen and Poor initiated the study of learning mixtures of linear
dynamical systems. While linear dynamical systems already have wide-ranging
applications in modeling time-series data, using mixture models can lead to a
better fit or even a richer understanding of underlying subpopulations
represented in the data. In this work we give a new approach to learning
mixtures of linear dynamical systems that is based on tensor decompositions. As
a result, our algorithm succeeds without strong separation conditions on the
components, and can be used to compete with the Bayes optimal clustering of the
trajectories. Moreover our algorithm works in the challenging
partially-observed setting. Our starting point is the simple but powerful
observation that the classic Ho-Kalman algorithm is a close relative of modern
tensor decomposition methods for learning latent variable models. This gives us
a playbook for how to extend it to work with more complicated generative
models.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This study addressed the complex task of sentiment analysis on a dataset of
119,988 original tweets from Weibo using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
offering a new approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP). The data, sourced
from Baidu&apos;s PaddlePaddle AI platform, were meticulously preprocessed,
tokenized, and categorized based on sentiment labels. A CNN-based model was
utilized, leveraging word embeddings for feature extraction, and trained to
perform sentiment classification. The model achieved a macro-average F1-score
of approximately 0.73 on the test set, showing balanced performance across
positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. The findings underscore the
effectiveness of CNNs for sentiment analysis tasks, with implications for
practical applications in social media analysis, market research, and policy
studies. The complete experimental content and code have been made publicly
available on the Kaggle data platform for further research and development.
Future work may involve exploring different architectures, such as Recurrent

<title>On the Effective Horizon of Inverse Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2307.06541v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06541</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms often rely on (forward)
reinforcement learning or planning over a given time horizon to compute an
approximately optimal policy for a hypothesized reward function and then match
this policy with expert demonstrations. The time horizon plays a critical role
in determining both the accuracy of reward estimate and the computational
efficiency of IRL algorithms. Interestingly, an effective time horizon shorter
than the ground-truth value often produces better results faster. This work
formally analyzes this phenomenon and provides an explanation: the time horizon
controls the complexity of an induced policy class and mitigates overfitting
with limited data. This analysis leads to a principled choice of the effective
horizon for IRL. It also prompts us to reexamine the classic IRL formulation:
it is more natural to learn jointly the reward and the effective horizon
together rather than the reward alone with a given horizon. Our experimental
results confirm the theoretical analysis.

<title>Full-resolution Lung Nodule Segmentation from Chest X-ray Images using Residual Encoder-Decoder Networks. (arXiv:2307.06547v1 [eess.IV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06547</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and early diagnosis is
associated with a positive prognosis. Chest X-ray (CXR) provides an inexpensive
imaging mode for lung cancer diagnosis. Suspicious nodules are difficult to
distinguish from vascular and bone structures using CXR. Computer vision has
previously been proposed to assist human radiologists in this task, however,
leading studies use down-sampled images and computationally expensive methods
with unproven generalization. Instead, this study localizes lung nodules using
efficient encoder-decoder neural networks that process full resolution images
to avoid any signal loss resulting from down-sampling. Encoder-decoder networks
are trained and tested using the JSRT lung nodule dataset. The networks are
used to localize lung nodules from an independent external CXR dataset.
Sensitivity and false positive rates are measured using an automated framework
to eliminate any observer subjectivity. These experiments allow for the
determination of the optimal network depth, image resolution and pre-processing
pipeline for generalized lung nodule localization. We find that nodule
localization is influenced by subtlety, with more subtle nodules being detected
in earlier training epochs. Therefore, we propose a novel self-ensemble model
from three consecutive epochs centered on the validation optimum. This ensemble
achieved a sensitivity of 85% in 10-fold internal testing with false positives
of 8 per image. A sensitivity of 81% is achieved at a false positive rate of 6
following morphological false positive reduction. This result is comparable to
more computationally complex systems based on linear and spatial filtering, but
with a sub-second inference time that is faster than other methods. The
proposed algorithm achieved excellent generalization results against an
external dataset with sensitivity of 77% at a false positive rate of 7.6.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the expressive power of deep neural networks for a

presents a sensor array with three metal oxide electrodes that can use machine

sensor array was subjected to various VOC concentrations, including ethanol,
acetone, toluene and chloroform. The dataset obtained from individual gases and
their mixtures were analyzed using multiple machine learning algorithms, such
as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Linear
Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis,
Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. KNN and RF have shown
more than 99% accuracy in classifying different varying chemicals in the gas
mixtures. In regression analysis, KNN has delivered the best results with R2
value of more than 0.99 and LOD of 0.012, 0.015, 0.014 and 0.025 PPM for
predicting the concentrations of varying chemicals Acetone, Toluene, Ethanol,

that the array utilizing the provided algorithms can classify and predict the
concentrations of the four gases simultaneously for disease diagnosis and

<title>Prescriptive Process Monitoring Under Resource Constraints: A Reinforcement Learning Approach. (arXiv:2307.06564v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06564</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Prescriptive process monitoring methods seek to optimize the performance of
business processes by triggering interventions at runtime, thereby increasing
the probability of positive case outcomes. These interventions are triggered
according to an intervention policy. Reinforcement learning has been put
forward as an approach to learning intervention policies through trial and
error. Existing approaches in this space assume that the number of resources
available to perform interventions in a process is unlimited, an unrealistic
assumption in practice. This paper argues that, in the presence of resource
constraints, a key dilemma in the field of prescriptive process monitoring is
to trigger interventions based not only on predictions of their necessity,
timeliness, or effect but also on the uncertainty of these predictions and the
level of resource utilization. Indeed, committing scarce resources to an
intervention when the necessity or effects of this intervention are highly
uncertain may intuitively lead to suboptimal intervention effects. Accordingly,
the paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for prescriptive process
monitoring that leverages conformal prediction techniques to consider the
uncertainty of the predictions upon which an intervention decision is based. An
evaluation using real-life datasets demonstrates that explicitly modeling
uncertainty using conformal predictions helps reinforcement learning agents
converge towards policies with higher net intervention gain

<title>Introducing Foundation Models as Surrogate Models: Advancing Towards More Practical Adversarial Attacks. (arXiv:2307.06608v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06608</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recently, the no-box adversarial attack, in which the attacker lacks access
to the model&apos;s architecture, weights, and training data, become the most
practical and challenging attack setup. However, there is an unawareness of the
potential and flexibility inherent in the surrogate model selection process on
no-box setting. Inspired by the burgeoning interest in utilizing foundational
models to address downstream tasks, this paper adopts an innovative idea that
1) recasting adversarial attack as a downstream task. Specifically, image noise
generation to meet the emerging trend and 2) introducing foundational models as
surrogate models. Harnessing the concept of non-robust features, we elaborate
on two guiding principles for surrogate model selection to explain why the
foundational model is an optimal choice for this role. However, paradoxically,
we observe that these foundational models underperform. Analyzing this
unexpected behavior within the feature space, we attribute the lackluster
performance of foundational models (e.g., CLIP) to their significant
representational capacity and, conversely, their lack of discriminative
prowess. To mitigate this issue, we propose the use of a margin-based loss
strategy for the fine-tuning of foundational models on target images. The
experimental results verify that our approach, which employs the basic Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack algorithm, outstrips the performance of
other, more convoluted algorithms. We conclude by advocating for the research
community to consider surrogate models as crucial determinants in the
effectiveness of adversarial attacks in no-box settings. The implications of
our work bear relevance for improving the efficacy of such adversarial attacks
and the overall robustness of AI systems.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The performance of data fusion and tracking algorithms often depends on
parameters that not only describe the sensor system, but can also be
task-specific. While for the sensor system tuning these variables is
time-consuming and mostly requires expert knowledge, intrinsic parameters of
targets under track can even be completely unobservable until the system is
deployed. With state-of-the-art sensor systems growing more and more complex,
the number of parameters naturally increases, necessitating the automatic
optimization of the model variables. In this paper, the parameters of an
interacting multiple model (IMM) filter are optimized solely using
measurements, thus without necessity for any ground-truth data. The resulting
method is evaluated through an ablation study on simulated data, where the
trained model manages to match the performance of a filter parametrized with
ground-truth values.

distributed learning refers to the process of training learning models on
distributed data sources. In our setting a set of agents need to cooperatively
train a learning model from streaming data. Differently from federated
learning, the proposed approach does not rely on a central server but only on
peer-to-peer communications among the agents. This approach is often used in
scenarios where data cannot be moved to a centralized location due to privacy,
security, or cost reasons. In order to overcome the absence of a central
server, we propose a distributed algorithm that relies on a quantized,
finite-time coordination protocol to aggregate the locally trained models.
Furthermore, our algorithm allows for the use of stochastic gradients during
local training. Stochastic gradients are computed using a randomly sampled
subset of the local training data, which makes the proposed algorithm more
efficient and scalable than traditional gradient descent. In our paper, we
analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the mean distance
from the online solution. Finally, we present numerical results for a logistic
regression task.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This work investigates the application of quantum machine learning techniques
for classical and quantum communication across different qubit channel models.
By employing parameterized quantum circuits and a flexible channel noise model,
we develop a machine learning framework to generate quantum channel codes and
evaluate their effectiveness. We explore classical, entanglement-assisted, and
quantum communication scenarios within our framework. Applying it to various
quantum channel models as proof of concept, we demonstrate strong performance
in each case. Our results highlight the potential of quantum machine learning

<title>Frameless Graph Knowledge Distillation. (arXiv:2307.06631v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06631</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great potential for transferring
knowledge from a complex teacher model to a simple student model in which the
heavy learning task can be accomplished efficiently and without losing too much
prediction accuracy. Recently, many attempts have been made by applying the KD
mechanism to the graph representation learning models such as graph neural
networks (GNNs) to accelerate the model&apos;s inference speed via student models.
However, many existing KD-based GNNs utilize MLP as a universal approximator in
the student model to imitate the teacher model&apos;s process without considering
the graph knowledge from the teacher model. In this work, we provide a KD-based
framework on multi-scaled GNNs, known as graph framelet, and prove that by
adequately utilizing the graph knowledge in a multi-scaled manner provided by
graph framelet decomposition, the student model is capable of adapting both
homophilic and heterophilic graphs and has the potential of alleviating the
over-squashing issue with a simple yet effectively graph surgery. Furthermore,
we show how the graph knowledge supplied by the teacher is learned and digested
by the student model via both algebra and geometry. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed model can generate learning accuracy identical to or
even surpass the teacher model while maintaining the high speed of inference.

<title>Discovering How Agents Learn Using Few Data. (arXiv:2307.06640v1 [cs.GT])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06640</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Decentralized learning algorithms are an essential tool for designing
multi-agent systems, as they enable agents to autonomously learn from their
experience and past interactions. In this work, we propose a theoretical and
algorithmic framework for real-time identification of the learning dynamics
that govern agent behavior using a short burst of a single system trajectory.
Our method identifies agent dynamics through polynomial regression, where we
compensate for limited data by incorporating side-information constraints that
capture fundamental assumptions or expectations about agent behavior. These
constraints are enforced computationally using sum-of-squares optimization,
leading to a hierarchy of increasingly better approximations of the true agent
dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach, using only 5
samples from a short run of a single trajectory, accurately recovers the true
dynamics across various benchmarks, including equilibrium selection and
prediction of chaotic systems up to 10 Lyapunov times. These findings suggest
that our approach has significant potential to support effective policy and
decision-making in strategic multi-agent systems.

<title>Multivariate Time Series characterization and forecasting of VoIP traffic in real mobile networks. (arXiv:2307.06645v1 [cs.NI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06645</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Predicting the behavior of real-time traffic (e.g., VoIP) in mobility
scenarios could help the operators to better plan their network infrastructures
and to optimize the allocation of resources. Accordingly, in this work the
authors propose a forecasting analysis of crucial QoS/QoE descriptors (some of
which neglected in the technical literature) of VoIP traffic in a real mobile
environment. The problem is formulated in terms of a multivariate time series
analysis. Such a formalization allows to discover and model the temporal
relationships among various descriptors and to forecast their behaviors for
future periods. Techniques such as Vector Autoregressive models and machine
learning (deep-based and tree-based) approaches are employed and compared in
terms of performance and time complexity, by reframing the multivariate time
series problem into a supervised learning one. Moreover, a series of auxiliary
analyses (stationarity, orthogonal impulse responses, etc.) are performed to
discover the analytical structure of the time series and to provide deep
insights about their relationships. The whole theoretical analysis has an
experimental counterpart since a set of trials across a real-world LTE-Advanced
environment has been performed to collect, post-process and analyze about
600,000 voice packets, organized per flow and differentiated per codec.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06688</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Heading towards navigational autonomy in unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in
the maritime sector can fundamentally lead towards safer waters as well as
reduced operating costs, while also providing a range of exciting new
capabilities for oceanic research, exploration and monitoring. However,
achieving such a goal is challenging. USV control systems must, safely and
reliably, be able to adhere to the international regulations for preventing
collisions at sea (COLREGs) in encounters with other vessels as they navigate
to a given waypoint while being affected by realistic weather conditions,
either during the day or at night. To deal with the multitude of possible
scenarios, it is critical to have a virtual environment that is able to
replicate the realistic operating conditions USVs will encounter, before they
can be implemented in the real world. Such &quot;digital twins&quot; form the foundations
upon which Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Computer Vision (CV)
algorithms can be used to develop and guide USV control systems. In this paper
we describe the novel development of a COLREG-compliant DRL-based collision
avoidant navigational system with CV-based awareness in a realistic ocean
simulation environment. The performance of the trained autonomous Agents
resulting from this approach is evaluated in several successful navigations to
set waypoints in both open sea and coastal encounters with other vessels. A
binary executable version of the simulator with trained agents is available at

impacts are subtle, our indicators can well estimate usage times with an $R^2$

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models are used to learn continuous
representations of entities and relations. A key task in the literature is
predicting missing links between entities. However, Knowledge Graphs are not
just sets of links but also have semantics underlying their structure.
Semantics is crucial in several downstream tasks, such as query answering or
reasoning. We introduce the subgraph inference task, where a model has to
generate likely and semantically valid subgraphs. We propose IntelliGraphs, a
set of five new Knowledge Graph datasets. The IntelliGraphs datasets contain
subgraphs with semantics expressed in logical rules for evaluating subgraph
inference. We also present the dataset generator that produced the synthetic
datasets. We designed four novel baseline models, which include three models
based on traditional KGEs. We evaluate their expressiveness and show that these
models cannot capture the semantics. We believe this benchmark will encourage
the development of machine learning models that emphasize semantic
understanding.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We address the video prediction task by putting forth a novel model that
combines (i) our recently proposed hierarchical residual vector quantized
variational autoencoder (HR-VQVAE), and (ii) a novel spatiotemporal PixelCNN
(ST-PixelCNN). We refer to this approach as a sequential hierarchical residual
learning vector quantized variational autoencoder (S-HR-VQVAE). By leveraging
the intrinsic capabilities of HR-VQVAE at modeling still images with a
parsimonious representation, combined with the ST-PixelCNN&apos;s ability at
handling spatiotemporal information, S-HR-VQVAE can better deal with chief
challenges in video prediction. These include learning spatiotemporal
information, handling high dimensional data, combating blurry prediction, and
implicit modeling of physical characteristics. Extensive experimental results
on the KTH Human Action and Moving-MNIST tasks demonstrate that our model
compares favorably against top video prediction techniques both in quantitative
and qualitative evaluations despite a much smaller model size. Finally, we
boost S-HR-VQVAE by proposing a novel training method to jointly estimate the
HR-VQVAE and ST-PixelCNN parameters.

<title>Why Guided Dialog Policy Learning performs well? Understanding the role of adversarial learning and its alternative. (arXiv:2307.06721v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06721</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Dialog policies, which determine a system&apos;s action based on the current state
at each dialog turn, are crucial to the success of the dialog. In recent years,
reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising option for dialog policy
learning (DPL). In RL-based DPL, dialog policies are updated according to
rewards. The manual construction of fine-grained rewards, such as
state-action-based ones, to effectively guide the dialog policy is challenging
in multi-domain task-oriented dialog scenarios with numerous state-action pair
combinations. One way to estimate rewards from collected data is to train the
reward estimator and dialog policy simultaneously using adversarial learning
(AL). Although this method has demonstrated superior performance
experimentally, it is fraught with the inherent problems of AL, such as mode
collapse. This paper first identifies the role of AL in DPL through detailed
analyses of the objective functions of dialog policy and reward estimator.
Next, based on these analyses, we propose a method that eliminates AL from
reward estimation and DPL while retaining its advantages. We evaluate our
method using MultiWOZ, a multi-domain task-oriented dialog corpus.

<title>Breaking 3-Factor Approximation for Correlation Clustering in Polylogarithmic Rounds. (arXiv:2307.06723v1 [cs.DS])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06723</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we study parallel algorithms for the correlation clustering
problem, where every pair of two different entities is labeled with similar or
dissimilar. The goal is to partition the entities into clusters to minimize the
number of disagreements with the labels. Currently, all efficient parallel
algorithms have an approximation ratio of at least 3. In comparison with the
$1.994+\epsilon$ ratio achieved by polynomial-time sequential algorithms
[CLN22], a significant gap exists.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose the first poly-logarithmic depth parallel algorithm that achieves
a better approximation ratio than 3. Specifically, our algorithm computes a
$(2.4+\epsilon)$-approximate solution and uses $\tilde{O}(m^{1.5})$ work.
Additionally, it can be translated into a $\tilde{O}(m^{1.5})$-time sequential
algorithm and a poly-logarithmic rounds sublinear-memory MPC algorithm with
$\tilde{O}(m^{1.5})$ total memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach is inspired by Awerbuch, Khandekar, and Rao&apos;s [AKR12]
length-constrained multi-commodity flow algorithm, where we develop an
efficient parallel algorithm to solve a truncated correlation clustering linear
program of Charikar, Guruswami, and Wirth [CGW05]. Then we show the solution of
the truncated linear program can be rounded with a factor of at most 2.4 loss
by using the framework of [CMSY15]. Such a rounding framework can then be
implemented using parallel pivot-based approaches.

<title>MPR-Net:Multi-Scale Pattern Reproduction Guided Universality Time Series Interpretable Forecasting. (arXiv:2307.06736v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06736</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Time series forecasting has received wide interest from existing research due
to its broad applications and inherent challenging. The research challenge lies
in identifying effective patterns in historical series and applying them to
future forecasting. Advanced models based on point-wise connected MLP and
Transformer architectures have strong fitting power, but their secondary
computational complexity limits practicality. Additionally, those structures
inherently disrupt the temporal order, reducing the information utilization and
making the forecasting process uninterpretable. To solve these problems, this
paper proposes a forecasting model, MPR-Net. It first adaptively decomposes
multi-scale historical series patterns using convolution operation, then
constructs a pattern extension forecasting method based on the prior knowledge
of pattern reproduction, and finally reconstructs future patterns into future
series using deconvolution operation. By leveraging the temporal dependencies
present in the time series, MPR-Net not only achieves linear time complexity,
but also makes the forecasting process interpretable. By carrying out
sufficient experiments on more than ten real data sets of both short and long
term forecasting tasks, MPR-Net achieves the state of the art forecasting
performance, as well as good generalization and robustness performance.

<title>Vehicle Dispatching and Routing of On-Demand Intercity Ride-Pooling Services: A Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach. (arXiv:2307.06742v1 [eess.SY])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06742</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The integrated development of city clusters has given rise to an increasing
demand for intercity travel. Intercity ride-pooling service exhibits
considerable potential in upgrading traditional intercity bus services by
implementing demand-responsive enhancements. Nevertheless, its online
operations suffer the inherent complexities due to the coupling of vehicle
resource allocation among cities and pooled-ride vehicle routing. To tackle
these challenges, this study proposes a two-level framework designed to
facilitate online fleet management. Specifically, a novel multi-agent feudal
reinforcement learning model is proposed at the upper level of the framework to
cooperatively assign idle vehicles to different intercity lines, while the
lower level updates the routes of vehicles using an adaptive large neighborhood
search heuristic. Numerical studies based on the realistic dataset of Xiamen
and its surrounding cities in China show that the proposed framework
effectively mitigates the supply and demand imbalances, and achieves
significant improvement in both the average daily system profit and order
fulfillment ratio.

<title>Cramer Type Distances for Learning Gaussian Mixture Models by Gradient Descent. (arXiv:2307.06753v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06753</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The learning of Gaussian Mixture Models (also referred to simply as GMMs)
plays an important role in machine learning. Known for their expressiveness and
interpretability, Gaussian mixture models have a wide range of applications,
from statistics, computer vision to distributional reinforcement learning.
However, as of today, few known algorithms can fit or learn these models, some
of which include Expectation-Maximization algorithms and Sliced Wasserstein
Distance. Even fewer algorithms are compatible with gradient descent, the
common learning process for neural networks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we derive a closed formula of two GMMs in the univariate,
one-dimensional case, then propose a distance function called Sliced Cram\&apos;er
2-distance for learning general multivariate GMMs. Our approach has several
advantages over many previous methods. First, it has a closed-form expression
for the univariate case and is easy to compute and implement using common
machine learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch and TensorFlow). Second, it is
compatible with gradient descent, which enables us to integrate GMMs with
neural networks seamlessly. Third, it can fit a GMM not only to a set of data
points, but also to another GMM directly, without sampling from the target
model. And fourth, it has some theoretical guarantees like global gradient
boundedness and unbiased sampling gradient. These features are especially
useful for distributional reinforcement learning and Deep Q Networks, where the
goal is to learn a distribution over future rewards. We will also construct a
Gaussian Mixture Distributional Deep Q Network as a toy example to demonstrate
its effectiveness. Compared with previous models, this model is parameter
efficient in terms of representing a distribution and possesses better
interpretability.

<title>Generalizing Supervised Deep Learning MRI Reconstruction to Multiple and Unseen Contrasts using Meta-Learning Hypernetworks. (arXiv:2307.06771v1 [eess.IV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06771</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Meta-learning has recently been an emerging data-efficient learning technique
for various medical imaging operations and has helped advance contemporary deep
learning models. Furthermore, meta-learning enhances the knowledge
generalization of the imaging tasks by learning both shared and discriminative
weights for various configurations of imaging tasks. However, existing
meta-learning models attempt to learn a single set of weight initializations of
a neural network that might be restrictive for multimodal data. This work aims
to develop a multimodal meta-learning model for image reconstruction, which
augments meta-learning with evolutionary capabilities to encompass diverse
acquisition settings of multimodal data. Our proposed model called KM-MAML
(Kernel Modulation-based Multimodal Meta-Learning), has hypernetworks that
evolve to generate mode-specific weights. These weights provide the
mode-specific inductive bias for multiple modes by re-calibrating each kernel
of the base network for image reconstruction via a low-rank kernel modulation
operation. We incorporate gradient-based meta-learning (GBML) in the contextual
space to update the weights of the hypernetworks for different modes. The
hypernetworks and the reconstruction network in the GBML setting provide
discriminative mode-specific features and low-level image features,
respectively. Experiments on multi-contrast MRI reconstruction show that our
model, (i) exhibits superior reconstruction performance over joint training,
other meta-learning methods, and context-specific MRI reconstruction methods,
and (ii) better adaptation capabilities with improvement margins of 0.5 dB in
PSNR and 0.01 in SSIM. Besides, a representation analysis with U-Net shows that
kernel modulation infuses 80% of mode-specific representation changes in the
high-resolution layers. Our source code is available at

<title>A Novel Site-Agnostic Multimodal Deep Learning Model to Identify Pro-Eating Disorder Content on Social Media. (arXiv:2307.06775v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06775</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, there has been a vast increase in eating disorder
diagnoses and eating disorder-attributed deaths, reaching their zenith during
the Covid-19 pandemic. This immense growth derived in part from the stressors
of the pandemic but also from increased exposure to social media, which is rife
with content that promotes eating disorders. Such content can induce eating
disorders in viewers. This study aimed to create a multimodal deep learning
model capable of determining whether a given social media post promotes eating
disorders based on a combination of visual and textual data. A labeled dataset
of Tweets was collected from Twitter, upon which twelve deep learning models
were trained and tested. Based on model performance, the most effective deep
learning model was the multimodal fusion of the RoBERTa natural language
processing model and the MaxViT image classification model, attaining accuracy
and F1 scores of 95.9% and 0.959 respectively. The RoBERTa and MaxViT fusion
model, deployed to classify an unlabeled dataset of posts from the social media
sites Tumblr and Reddit, generated similar classifications as previous research
studies that did not employ artificial intelligence, showing that artificial
intelligence can develop insights congruent to those of researchers.
Additionally, the model was used to conduct a time-series analysis of yet
unseen Tweets from eight Twitter hashtags, uncovering that the relative
abundance of pro-eating disorder content has decreased drastically. However,
since approximately 2018, pro-eating disorder content has either stopped its
decline or risen once more in ampleness.

<title>Robotic surface exploration with vision and tactile sensing for cracks detection and characterisation. (arXiv:2307.06784v1 [cs.RO])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06784</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a novel algorithm for crack localisation and detection
based on visual and tactile analysis via fibre-optics. A finger-shaped sensor
based on fibre-optics is employed for the data acquisition to collect data for
the analysis and the experiments. To detect the possible locations of cracks a
camera is used to scan an environment while running an object detection
algorithm. Once the crack is detected, a fully-connected graph is created from
a skeletonised version of the crack. A minimum spanning tree is then employed
for calculating the shortest path to explore the crack which is then used to
develop the motion planner for the robotic manipulator. The motion planner
divides the crack into multiple nodes which are then explored individually.
Then, the manipulator starts the exploration and performs the tactile data
classification to confirm if there is indeed a crack in that location or just a
false positive from the vision algorithm. If a crack is detected, also the
length, width, orientation and number of branches are calculated. This is
repeated until all the nodes of the crack are explored.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to validate the complete algorithm, various experiments are
performed: comparison of exploration of cracks through full scan and motion
planning algorithm, implementation of frequency-based features for crack
classification and geometry analysis using a combination of vision and tactile
data. From the results of the experiments, it is shown that the proposed
algorithm is able to detect cracks and improve the results obtained from vision
to correctly classify cracks and their geometry with minimal cost thanks to the
motion planning algorithm.

non-equilibrium effects. This approach, applied on the Restricted Boltzmann
Machine, improves the model&apos;s ability to correctly classify samples and
generate high-quality synthetic data in only a few sampling steps. The
effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by its successful application to
four different types of data: handwritten digits, mutations of human genomes
classified by continental origin, functionally characterized sequences of an

<title>Data-driven Nonlinear Parametric Model Order Reduction Framework using Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder. (arXiv:2307.06816v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06816</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A data-driven parametric model order reduction (MOR) method using a deep
artificial neural network is proposed. The present network, which is the
least-squares hierarchical variational autoencoder (LSH-VAE), is capable of
performing nonlinear MOR for the parametric interpolation of a nonlinear
dynamic system with a significant number of degrees of freedom. LSH-VAE
exploits two major changes to the existing networks: a hierarchical deep
structure and a hybrid weighted, probabilistic loss function. The enhancements
result in a significantly improved accuracy and stability compared against the
conventional nonlinear MOR methods, autoencoder, and variational autoencoder.
Upon LSH-VAE, a parametric MOR framework is presented based on the spherically
linear interpolation of the latent manifold. The present framework is validated
and evaluated on three nonlinear and multiphysics dynamic systems. First, the
present framework is evaluated on the fluid-structure interaction benchmark
problem to assess its efficiency and accuracy. Then, a highly nonlinear
aeroelastic phenomenon, limit cycle oscillation, is analyzed. Finally, the
present framework is applied to a three-dimensional fluid flow to demonstrate
its capability of efficiently analyzing a significantly large number of degrees
of freedom. The performance of LSH-VAE is emphasized by comparing its results
against that of the widely used nonlinear MOR methods, convolutional
autoencoder, and $\beta$-VAE. The present framework exhibits a significantly
enhanced accuracy to the conventional methods while still exhibiting a large
speed-up factor.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate the use of the learned digital back-propagation
(LDBP) for equalizing dual-polarization fiber-optic transmission in
dispersion-managed (DM) links. LDBP is a deep neural network that optimizes the

LDBP in a simulated WDM dual-polarization fiber transmission system operating
at the bitrate of 256 Gbit/s per channel, with a dispersion map designed for a
2016 km link with 15% residual dispersion. Our results show that in
single-channel transmission, LDBP achieves an effective signal-to-noise ratio
improvement of 6.3 dB and 2.5 dB, respectively, over linear equalization and
DBP. In WDM transmission, the corresponding $Q$-factor gains are 1.1 dB and 0.4
dB, respectively. Additionally, we conduct a complexity analysis, which reveals
that a frequency-domain implementation of LDBP and DBP is more favorable in
terms of complexity than the time-domain implementation. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of LDBP in mitigating the nonlinear effects in DM
fiber-optic transmission systems.

Federated meta-learning is a promising answer to this question, as it addresses
the scarcity of labeled data and heterogeneous data distribution across devices
in the real world. However, deploying TinyML hardware faces unique resource
constraints, making existing methods impractical due to energy, privacy, and
communication limitations. We introduce TinyMetaFed, a model-agnostic
meta-learning framework suitable for TinyML. TinyMetaFed facilitates
collaborative training of a neural network initialization that can be quickly
fine-tuned on new devices. It offers communication savings and privacy
protection through partial local reconstruction and Top-P% selective

client heterogeneity through few-shot learning. The evaluations on three TinyML

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Domain generalization (DG) is about learning models that generalize well to
new domains that are related to, but different from, the training domain(s). It
is a fundamental problem in machine learning and has attracted much attention
in recent years. A large number of approaches have been proposed. Different
approaches are motivated from different perspectives, making it difficult to
gain an overall understanding of the area. In this paper, we propose a causal
framework for domain generalization and present an understanding of common DG
approaches in the framework. Our work sheds new lights on the following
questions: (1) What are the key ideas behind each DG method? (2) Why is it
expected to improve generalization to new domains theoretically? (3) How are

<title>A Novel Bayes&apos; Theorem for Upper Probabilities. (arXiv:2307.06831v1 [stat.ML])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06831</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In their seminal 1990 paper, Wasserman and Kadane establish an upper bound
for the Bayes&apos; posterior probability of a measurable set $A$, when the prior
lies in a class of probability measures $\mathcal{P}$ and the likelihood is
precise. They also give a sufficient condition for such upper bound to hold
with equality. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of their result by
additionally addressing uncertainty related to the likelihood. We give an upper
bound for the posterior probability when both the prior and the likelihood
belong to a set of probabilities. Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition
for this upper bound to become an equality. This result is interesting on its
own, and has the potential of being applied to various fields of engineering
(e.g. model predictive control), machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

<title>Enhancing Reliability in Federated mmWave Networks: A Practical and Scalable Solution using Radar-Aided Dynamic Blockage Recognition. (arXiv:2307.06834v1 [cs.NI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06834</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This article introduces a new method to improve the dependability of
millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) network services in dynamic
outdoor environments. In these settings, line-of-sight (LoS) connections are
easily interrupted by moving obstacles like humans and vehicles. The proposed
approach, coined as Radar-aided Dynamic blockage Recognition (RaDaR), leverages
radar measurements and federated learning (FL) to train a dual-output neural
network (NN) model capable of simultaneously predicting blockage status and
time. This enables determining the optimal point for proactive handover (PHO)
or beam switching, thereby reducing the latency introduced by 5G new radio
procedures and ensuring high quality of experience (QoE). The framework employs
radar sensors to monitor and track objects movement, generating range-angle and
range-velocity maps that are useful for scene analysis and predictions.
Moreover, FL provides additional benefits such as privacy protection,
scalability, and knowledge sharing. The framework is assessed using an
extensive real-world dataset comprising mmWave channel information and radar
data. The evaluation results show that RaDaR substantially enhances network
reliability, achieving an average success rate of 94% for PHO compared to
existing reactive HO procedures that lack proactive blockage prediction.
Additionally, RaDaR maintains a superior QoE by ensuring sustained high
throughput levels and minimising PHO latency.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Regression algorithms are regularly used for improving the accuracy of
satellite precipitation products. In this context, ground-based measurements
are the dependent variable and the satellite data are the predictor variables,
together with topography factors. Alongside this, it is increasingly recognised
in many fields that combinations of algorithms through ensemble learning can
lead to substantial predictive performance improvements. Still, a sufficient
number of ensemble learners for improving the accuracy of satellite
precipitation products and their large-scale comparison are currently missing
from the literature. In this work, we fill this specific gap by proposing 11
new ensemble learners in the field and by extensively comparing them for the
entire contiguous United States and for a 15-year period. We use monthly data
from the PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information
using Artificial Neural Networks) and IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE
Retrievals for GPM) gridded datasets. We also use gauge-measured precipitation
data from the Global Historical Climatology Network monthly database, version 2
(GHCNm). The ensemble learners combine the predictions by six regression
algorithms (base learners), namely the multivariate adaptive regression splines
(MARS), multivariate adaptive polynomial splines (poly-MARS), random forests
(RF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and
Bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNN), and each of them is based on a
different combiner. The combiners include the equal-weight combiner, the median
combiner, two best learners and seven variants of a sophisticated stacking
method. The latter stacks a regression algorithm on the top of the base
learners to combine their independent predictions...

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper addresses the efficient management of Mobile Access Points (MAPs),

decision process determines the number of MAPs through consensus, and we
develop a joint optimization process to account for co-dependence in network
self-management. In the low-layer, MAPs manage their placement using a
double-attention based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model that encourages
cooperation without retraining. To improve generalization and reduce
complexity, we propose a federated mechanism for training and sharing one
placement model for every MAP in the low-layer. Additionally, we jointly
optimize the placement and backhaul connectivity of MAPs using a
multi-objective reward function, considering the impact of varying MAP

<title>Tensor Completion via Leverage Sampling and Tensor QR Decomposition for Network Latency Estimation. (arXiv:2307.06848v1 [cs.NI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06848</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we consider the network latency estimation, which has been an
important metric for network performance. However, a large scale of network
latency estimation requires a lot of computing time. Therefore, we propose a
new method that is much faster and maintains high accuracy. The data structure
of network nodes can form a matrix, and the tensor model can be formed by
introducing the time dimension. Thus, the entire problem can be be summarized
as a tensor completion problem. The main idea of our method is improving the
tensor leverage sampling strategy and introduce tensor QR decomposition into
tensor completion. To achieve faster tensor leverage sampling, we replace
tensor singular decomposition (t-SVD) with tensor CSVD-QR to appoximate t-SVD.
To achieve faster completion for incomplete tensor, we use the tensor
$L_{2,1}$-norm rather than traditional tensor nuclear norm. Furthermore, we
introduce tensor QR decomposition into alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) framework. Numerical experiments witness that our method is
faster than state-of-art algorithms with satisfactory accuracy.

extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our approach consistently recovers
the optimal or near-optimal generation from a set of candidates. We also
propose lightweight parameter-free similarity functions that show significant

how data is shared across task models, our approach learns shared and
non-shared models and determines which to use online during planning based on
auxiliary tasks that serve as a proxy for each model&apos;s understanding of a

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Local authorities in England, such as Leicestershire County Council (LCC),
provide Early Help services that can be offered at any point in a young
person&apos;s life when they experience difficulties that cannot be supported by
universal services alone, such as schools. This paper investigates the
utilisation of machine learning (ML) to assist experts in identifying families
that may need to be referred for Early Help assessment and support. LCC
provided an anonymised dataset comprising 14360 records of young people under
the age of 18. The dataset was pre-processed, machine learning models were
build, and experiments were conducted to validate and test the performance of
the models. Bias mitigation techniques were applied to improve the fairness of
these models. During testing, while the models demonstrated the capability to
identify young people requiring intervention or early help, they also produced
a significant number of false positives, especially when constructed with
imbalanced data, incorrectly identifying individuals who most likely did not
need an Early Help referral. This paper empirically explores the suitability of
data-driven ML models for identifying young people who may require Early Help
services and discusses their appropriateness and limitations for this task.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The problem of continual learning in the domain of reinforcement learning,
often called non-stationary reinforcement learning, has been identified as an
important challenge to the application of reinforcement learning. We prove a
worst-case complexity result, which we believe captures this challenge:
Modifying the probabilities or the reward of a single state-action pair in a
reinforcement learning problem requires an amount of time almost as large as
the number of states in order to keep the value function up to date, unless the
strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) is false; SETH is a widely accepted
strengthening of the P $\neq$ NP conjecture. Recall that the number of states
in current applications of reinforcement learning is typically astronomical. In

<title>Min-Max Optimization under Delays. (arXiv:2307.06886v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06886</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Delays and asynchrony are inevitable in large-scale machine-learning problems
where communication plays a key role. As such, several works have extensively
analyzed stochastic optimization with delayed gradients. However, as far as we
are aware, no analogous theory is available for min-max optimization, a topic
that has gained recent popularity due to applications in adversarial
robustness, game theory, and reinforcement learning. Motivated by this gap, we
examine the performance of standard min-max optimization algorithms with
delayed gradient updates. First, we show (empirically) that even small delays
can cause prominent algorithms like Extra-gradient (\texttt{EG}) to diverge on
simple instances for which \texttt{EG} guarantees convergence in the absence of
delays. Our empirical study thus suggests the need for a careful analysis of
delayed versions of min-max optimization algorithms. Accordingly, under
suitable technical assumptions, we prove that Gradient Descent-Ascent
(\texttt{GDA}) and \texttt{EG} with delayed updates continue to guarantee
convergence to saddle points for convex-concave and strongly convex-strongly
concave settings. Our complexity bounds reveal, in a transparent manner, the
slow-down in convergence caused by delays.

<title>Provable Multi-Task Representation Learning by Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks. (arXiv:2307.06887v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06887</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Feature learning, i.e. extracting meaningful representations of data, is
quintessential to the practical success of neural networks trained with
gradient descent, yet it is notoriously difficult to explain how and why it
occurs. Recent theoretical studies have shown that shallow neural networks
optimized on a single task with gradient-based methods can learn meaningful
features, extending our understanding beyond the neural tangent kernel or
random feature regime in which negligible feature learning occurs. But in
practice, neural networks are increasingly often trained on {\em many} tasks
simultaneously with differing loss functions, and these prior analyses do not
generalize to such settings. In the multi-task learning setting, a variety of
studies have shown effective feature learning by simple linear models. However,
multi-task learning via {\em nonlinear} models, arguably the most common
learning paradigm in practice, remains largely mysterious. In this work, we
present the first results proving feature learning occurs in a multi-task
setting with a nonlinear model. We show that when the tasks are binary
classification problems with labels depending on only $r$ directions within the
ambient $d\gg r$-dimensional input space, executing a simple gradient-based
multitask learning algorithm on a two-layer ReLU neural network learns the
ground-truth $r$ directions. In particular, any downstream task on the $r$
ground-truth coordinates can be solved by learning a linear classifier with
sample and neuron complexity independent of the ambient dimension $d$, while a
random feature model requires exponential complexity in $d$ for such a
guarantee.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06913</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Interpreting the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
establishing trust and ensuring model safety. Concept-based explanations have
emerged as a superior approach that is more interpretable than feature
attribution estimates such as pixel saliency. However, defining the concepts
for the interpretability analysis biases the explanations by the user&apos;s
expectations on the concepts. To address this, we propose a novel post-hoc
unsupervised method that automatically uncovers the concepts learned by deep
models during training. By decomposing the latent space of a layer in singular
vectors and refining them by unsupervised clustering, we uncover concept
vectors aligned with directions of high variance that are relevant to the model
prediction, and that point to semantically distinct concepts. Our extensive
experiments reveal that the majority of our concepts are readily understandable
to humans, exhibit coherency, and bear relevance to the task at hand. Moreover,
we showcase the practical utility of our method in dataset exploration, where
our concept vectors successfully identify outlier training samples affected by
various confounding factors. This novel exploration technique has remarkable
versatility to data types and model architectures and it will facilitate the
identification of biases and the discovery of sources of error within training
data.

the ability to associate the environment with natural language. By
understanding the commands from the user, DRAGON is able to guide the user to

questions from visual observations. Through effective utilization of dialogue,
the robot can ground the user&apos;s free-form descriptions to landmarks in the

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06925</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Text-to-image (T2I) personalization allows users to guide the creative image
generation process by combining their own visual concepts in natural language
prompts. Recently, encoder-based techniques have emerged as a new effective
approach for T2I personalization, reducing the need for multiple images and
long training times. However, most existing encoders are limited to a
single-class domain, which hinders their ability to handle diverse concepts. In
this work, we propose a domain-agnostic method that does not require any
specialized dataset or prior information about the personalized concepts. We
introduce a novel contrastive-based regularization technique to maintain high
fidelity to the target concept characteristics while keeping the predicted
embeddings close to editable regions of the latent space, by pushing the
predicted tokens toward their nearest existing CLIP tokens. Our experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show how the learned
tokens are more semantic than tokens predicted by unregularized models. This
leads to a better representation that achieves state-of-the-art performance
while being more flexible than previous methods.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06941</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has received widespread interest in
recent years, and two of the most popular types of explanations are feature
attributions, and counterfactual explanations. These classes of approaches have
been largely studied independently and the few attempts at reconciling them
have been primarily empirical. This work establishes a clear theoretical
connection between game-theoretic feature attributions, focusing on but not
limited to SHAP, and counterfactuals explanations. After motivating operative
changes to Shapley values based feature attributions and counterfactual
explanations, we prove that, under conditions, they are in fact equivalent. We
then extend the equivalency result to game-theoretic solution concepts beyond
Shapley values. Moreover, through the analysis of the conditions of such
equivalence, we shed light on the limitations of naively using counterfactual
explanations to provide feature importances. Experiments on three datasets
quantitatively show the difference in explanations at every stage of the
connection between the two approaches and corroborate the theoretical findings.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose the In-context Autoencoder (ICAE) for context compression in a
large language model (LLM). The ICAE has two modules: a learnable encoder
adapted with LoRA from an LLM for compressing a long context into a limited
number of memory slots, and a fixed decoder which is the target LLM that can
condition on the memory slots for various purposes. We first pretrain the ICAE
using both autoencoding and language modeling objectives on massive text data,
enabling it to generate memory slots that accurately and comprehensively
represent the original context. Then, we fine-tune the pretrained ICAE on a
small amount of instruct data to enhance its interaction with various prompts
for producing desirable responses. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the ICAE learned with our proposed pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm can
effectively produce memory slots with $4\times$ context compression, which can
be well conditioned on by the target LLM to respond to various prompts. The
promising results demonstrate significant implications of the ICAE for its
novel approach to the long context problem and its potential to reduce
computation and memory overheads for LLM inference in practice, suggesting
further research effort in context management for an LLM. Our code and data
will be released shortly.

generative AI, enabling the synthesis of individuals in diverse contexts and

investment, and storing a personalized model per subject can be demanding in
terms of storage capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose
HyperDreamBooth-a hypernetwork capable of efficiently generating a small set of
personalized weights from a single image of a person. By composing these
weights into the diffusion model, coupled with fast finetuning, HyperDreamBooth
can generate a person&apos;s face in various contexts and styles, with high subject

and semantic modifications. Our method achieves personalization on faces in
roughly 20 seconds, 25x faster than DreamBooth and 125x faster than Textual
Inversion, using as few as one reference image, with the same quality and style
diversity as DreamBooth. Also our method yields a model that is 10000x smaller

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Agents that can learn to imitate given video observation -- \emph{without
direct access to state or action information} are more applicable to learning
in the natural world. However, formulating a reinforcement learning (RL) agent
that facilitates this goal remains a significant challenge. We approach this
challenge using contrastive training to learn a reward function comparing an
agent&apos;s behaviour with a single demonstration. We use a Siamese recurrent
neural network architecture to learn rewards in space and time between motion
clips while training an RL policy to minimize this distance. Through
experimentation, we also find that the inclusion of multi-task data and
additional image encoding losses improve the temporal consistency of the
learned rewards and, as a result, significantly improves policy learning. We
demonstrate our approach on simulated humanoid, dog, and raptor agents in 2D
and a quadruped and a humanoid in 3D. We show that our method outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques in these environments and can learn to
imitate from a single video demonstration.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;It is common to use networks to encode the architecture of interactions
between entities in complex systems in the physical, biological, social, and
information sciences. To study the large-scale behavior of complex systems, it
is useful to examine mesoscale structures in networks as building blocks that
influence such behavior. We present a new approach for describing low-rank
mesoscale structures in networks, and we illustrate our approach using several
synthetic network models and empirical friendship, collaboration, and
protein--protein interaction (PPI) networks. We find that these networks
possess a relatively small number of `latent motifs&apos; that together can
successfully approximate most subgraphs of a network at a fixed mesoscale. We
use an algorithm for `network dictionary learning&apos; (NDL), which combines a
network-sampling method and nonnegative matrix factorization, to learn the
latent motifs of a given network. The ability to encode a network using a set
of latent motifs has a wide variety of applications to network-analysis tasks,
such as comparison, denoising, and edge inference. Additionally, using a new
network denoising and reconstruction (NDR) algorithm, we demonstrate how to
denoise a corrupted network by using only the latent motifs that one learns
directly from the corrupted network.

<title>A New Formalism, Method and Open Issues for Zero-Shot Coordination. (arXiv:2106.06613v3 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06613</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In many coordination problems, independently reasoning humans are able to
discover mutually compatible policies. In contrast, independently trained
self-play policies are often mutually incompatible. Zero-shot coordination
(ZSC) has recently been proposed as a new frontier in multi-agent reinforcement
learning to address this fundamental issue. Prior work approaches the ZSC
problem by assuming players can agree on a shared learning algorithm but not on
labels for actions and observations, and proposes other-play as an optimal
solution. However, until now, this &quot;label-free&quot; problem has only been
informally defined. We formalize this setting as the label-free coordination
(LFC) problem by defining the label-free coordination game. We show that
other-play is not an optimal solution to the LFC problem as it fails to
consistently break ties between incompatible maximizers of the other-play
objective. We introduce an extension of the algorithm, other-play with
tie-breaking, and prove that it is optimal in the LFC problem and an
equilibrium in the LFC game. Since arbitrary tie-breaking is precisely what the
ZSC setting aims to prevent, we conclude that the LFC problem does not reflect
the aims of ZSC. To address this, we introduce an alternative informal
operationalization of ZSC as a starting point for future work.

<title>Balanced Coarsening for Multilevel Hypergraph Partitioning via Wasserstein Discrepancy. (arXiv:2106.07501v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07501</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a balanced coarsening scheme for multilevel hypergraph
partitioning. In addition, an initial partitioning algorithm is designed to
improve the quality of k-way hypergraph partitioning. By assigning vertex
weights through the LPT algorithm, we generate a prior hypergraph under a
relaxed balance constraint. With the prior hypergraph, we have defined the
Wasserstein discrepancy to coordinate the optimal transport of coarsening
process. And the optimal transport matrix is solved by Sinkhorn algorithm. Our
coarsening scheme fully takes into account the minimization of connectivity
metric (objective function). For the initial partitioning stage, we define a
normalized cut function induced by Fiedler vector, which is theoretically
proved to be a concave function. Thereby, a three-point algorithm is designed
to find the best cut under the balance constraint.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The capability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to recognize objects in
orientations outside the distribution of the training data is not well
understood. We present evidence that DNNs are capable of generalizing to
objects in novel orientations by disseminating orientation-invariance obtained
from familiar objects seen from many viewpoints. This capability strengthens
when training the DNN with an increasing number of familiar objects, but only
in orientations that involve 2D rotations of familiar orientations. We show
that this dissemination is achieved via neurons tuned to common features
between familiar and unfamiliar objects. These results implicate brain-like
neural mechanisms for generalization.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Projecting climate change is a generalization problem: we extrapolate the
recent past using physical models across past, present, and future climates.
Current climate models require representations of processes that occur at
scales smaller than model grid size, which have been the main source of model
projection uncertainty. Recent machine learning (ML) algorithms hold promise to
improve such process representations, but tend to extrapolate poorly to climate
regimes they were not trained on. To get the best of the physical and
statistical worlds, we propose a new framework -- termed &quot;climate-invariant&quot; ML
-- incorporating knowledge of climate processes into ML algorithms, and show
that it can maintain high accuracy across a wide range of climate and
geographic conditions in three distinct atmospheric models. Our results suggest
that explicitly incorporating physical knowledge into data-driven models of
Earth system processes can improve their consistency, data efficiency, and
generalizability across climate regimes.

<title>Bregman Deviations of Generic Exponential Families. (arXiv:2201.07306v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We revisit the method of mixture technique, also known as the Laplace method,
to study the concentration phenomenon in generic exponential families.
Combining the properties of Bregman divergence associated with log-partition
function of the family with the method of mixtures for super-martingales, we
establish a generic bound controlling the Bregman divergence between the
parameter of the family and a finite sample estimate of the parameter. Our
bound is time-uniform and makes appear a quantity extending the classical
information gain to exponential families, which we call the Bregman information
gain. For the practitioner, we instantiate this novel bound to several
classical families, e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli, Exponential, Weibull, Pareto,
Poisson and Chi-square yielding explicit forms of the confidence sets and the
Bregman information gain. We further numerically compare the resulting
confidence bounds to state-of-the-art alternatives for time-uniform
concentration and show that this novel method yields competitive results.
Finally, we highlight the benefit of our concentration bounds on some
illustrative applications.

<title>Prospective Learning: Principled Extrapolation to the Future. (arXiv:2201.07372v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07372</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Learning is a process which can update decision rules, based on past
experience, such that future performance improves. Traditionally, machine
learning is often evaluated under the assumption that the future will be
identical to the past in distribution or change adversarially. But these
assumptions can be either too optimistic or pessimistic for many problems in
the real world. Real world scenarios evolve over multiple spatiotemporal scales
with partially predictable dynamics. Here we reformulate the learning problem
to one that centers around this idea of dynamic futures that are partially
learnable. We conjecture that certain sequences of tasks are not
retrospectively learnable (in which the data distribution is fixed), but are
prospectively learnable (in which distributions may be dynamic), suggesting
that prospective learning is more difficult in kind than retrospective
learning. We argue that prospective learning more accurately characterizes many
real world problems that (1) currently stymie existing artificial intelligence
solutions and/or (2) lack adequate explanations for how natural intelligences
solve them. Thus, studying prospective learning will lead to deeper insights
and solutions to currently vexing challenges in both natural and artificial
intelligences.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider stochastic optimization problems where data is drawn from a
Markov chain. Existing methods for this setting crucially rely on knowing the
mixing time of the chain, which in real-world applications is usually unknown.
We propose the first optimization method that does not require the knowledge of
the mixing time, yet obtains the optimal asymptotic convergence rate when
applied to convex problems. We further show that our approach can be extended
to: (i) finding stationary points in non-convex optimization with Markovian
data, and (ii) obtaining better dependence on the mixing time in temporal
difference (TD) learning; in both cases, our method is completely oblivious to
the mixing time. Our method relies on a novel combination of multi-level Monte

<title>Efficient Bayesian Policy Reuse with a Scalable Observation Model in Deep Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2204.07729v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07729</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian policy reuse (BPR) is a general policy transfer framework for
selecting a source policy from an offline library by inferring the task belief
based on some observation signals and a trained observation model. In this
paper, we propose an improved BPR method to achieve more efficient policy
transfer in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, most BPR algorithms use
the episodic return as the observation signal that contains limited information
and cannot be obtained until the end of an episode. Instead, we employ the
state transition sample, which is informative and instantaneous, as the
observation signal for faster and more accurate task inference. Second, BPR
algorithms usually require numerous samples to estimate the probability
distribution of the tabular-based observation model, which may be expensive and
even infeasible to learn and maintain, especially when using the state
transition sample as the signal. Hence, we propose a scalable observation model
based on fitting state transition functions of source tasks from only a small
number of samples, which can generalize to any signals observed in the target
task. Moreover, we extend the offline-mode BPR to the continual learning
setting by expanding the scalable observation model in a plug-and-play fashion,
which can avoid negative transfer when faced with new unknown tasks.
Experimental results show that our method can consistently facilitate faster
and more efficient policy transfer.

network compression. We present a methodology for the systematic exploration of
different DNN pruning, quantization, and deployment strategies, targeting
different ARM Cortex-M based low-power systems. The exploration allows to
analyze trade-offs between key metrics such as accuracy, memory consumption,
execution time, and power consumption. We discuss experimental results on three
different DNN architectures and show that we can compress them to below 10\% of
their original parameter count before their predictive quality decreases. This
also allows us to deploy and evaluate them on Cortex-M based microcontrollers.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study the problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, that is,
detecting whether a learning algorithm&apos;s output can be trusted at inference
time. While a number of tests for OOD detection have been proposed in prior
work, a formal framework for studying this problem is lacking. We propose a
definition for the notion of OOD that includes both the input distribution and
the learning algorithm, which provides insights for the construction of
powerful tests for OOD detection. We propose a multiple hypothesis testing
inspired procedure to systematically combine any number of different statistics
from the learning algorithm using conformal p-values. We further provide strong
guarantees on the probability of incorrectly classifying an in-distribution
sample as OOD. In our experiments, we find that threshold-based tests proposed
in prior work perform well in specific settings, but not uniformly well across
different types of OOD instances. In contrast, our proposed method that
combines multiple statistics performs uniformly well across different datasets
and neural networks.

<title>Classification and Generation of real-world data with an Associative Memory Model. (arXiv:2207.04827v4 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04827</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Drawing from memory the face of a friend you have not seen in years is a
difficult task. However, if you happen to cross paths, you would easily
recognize each other. The biological memory is equipped with an impressive
compression algorithm that can store the essential, and then infer the details
to match perception. The Willshaw Memory is a simple abstract model for
cortical computations which implements mechanisms of biological memories. Using
our recently proposed sparse coding prescription for visual patterns, this
model can store and retrieve an impressive amount of real-world data in a
fault-tolerant manner. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of the basic
Associative Memory Model by using a Multiple-Modality framework. In this
setting, the memory stores several modalities (e.g., visual, or textual) of
each pattern simultaneously. After training, the memory can be used to infer
missing modalities when just a subset is perceived. Using a simple
encoder-memory-decoder architecture, and a newly proposed iterative retrieval
algorithm for the Willshaw Model, we perform experiments on the MNIST dataset.
By storing both the images and labels as modalities, a single Memory can be
used not only to retrieve and complete patterns but also to classify and
generate new ones. We further discuss how this model could be used for other
learning tasks, thus serving as a biologically-inspired framework for learning.

<title>TRUST-LAPSE: An Explainable and Actionable Mistrust Scoring Framework for Model Monitoring. (arXiv:2207.11290v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11290</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Continuous monitoring of trained ML models to determine when their
predictions should and should not be trusted is essential for their safe
deployment. Such a framework ought to be high-performing, explainable, post-hoc
and actionable. We propose TRUST-LAPSE, a &quot;mistrust&quot; scoring framework for
continuous model monitoring. We assess the trustworthiness of each input
sample&apos;s model prediction using a sequence of latent-space embeddings.
Specifically, (a) our latent-space mistrust score estimates mistrust using
distance metrics (Mahalanobis distance) and similarity metrics (cosine
similarity) in the latent-space and (b) our sequential mistrust score
determines deviations in correlations over the sequence of past input
representations in a non-parametric, sliding-window based algorithm for
actionable continuous monitoring. We evaluate TRUST-LAPSE via two downstream
tasks: (1) distributionally shifted input detection, and (2) data drift
detection. We evaluate across diverse domains - audio and vision using public
datasets and further benchmark our approach on challenging, real-world
electroencephalograms (EEG) datasets for seizure detection. Our latent-space
mistrust scores achieve state-of-the-art results with AUROCs of 84.1 (vision),
73.9 (audio), and 77.1 (clinical EEGs), outperforming baselines by over 10
points. We expose critical failures in popular baselines that remain
insensitive to input semantic content, rendering them unfit for real-world
model monitoring. We show that our sequential mistrust scores achieve high
drift detection rates; over 90% of the streams show &amp;lt; 20% error for all
domains. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show
that our mistrust scores are more robust and provide explainability for easy
adoption into practice.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07734</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative to
create supervisory signals to real-world problems, avoiding the extensive cost
of manual labeling. SSL is particularly attractive for unsupervised tasks such
as anomaly detection (AD), where labeled anomalies are rare or often
nonexistent. A large catalog of augmentation functions has been used for
SSL-based AD (SSAD) on image data, and recent works have reported that the type
of augmentation has a significant impact on accuracy. Motivated by those, this
work sets out to put image-based SSAD under a larger lens and investigate the
role of data augmentation in SSAD. Through extensive experiments on 3 different
detector models and across 420 AD tasks, we provide comprehensive numerical and
visual evidences that the alignment between data augmentation and
anomaly-generating mechanism is the key to the success of SSAD, and in the lack
thereof, SSL may even impair accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first meta-analysis on the role of data augmentation in SSAD.

<title>Local Intrinsic Dimensionality Measures for Graphs, with Applications to Graph Embeddings. (arXiv:2208.11986v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11986</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The notion of local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) is an important
advancement in data dimensionality analysis, with applications in data mining,
machine learning and similarity search problems. Existing distance-based LID
estimators were designed for tabular datasets encompassing data points
represented as vectors in a Euclidean space. After discussing their limitations
for graph-structured data considering graph embeddings and graph distances, we
propose NC-LID, a novel LID-related measure for quantifying the discriminatory
power of the shortest-path distance with respect to natural communities of
nodes as their intrinsic localities. It is shown how this measure can be used
to design LID-aware graph embedding algorithms by formulating two LID-elastic
variants of node2vec with personalized hyperparameters that are adjusted
according to NC-LID values. Our empirical analysis of NC-LID on a large number
of real-world graphs shows that this measure is able to point to nodes with
high link reconstruction errors in node2vec embeddings better than node
centrality metrics. The experimental evaluation also shows that the proposed
LID-elastic node2vec extensions improve node2vec by better preserving graph
structure in generated embeddings.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06392</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider the multi-user detection (MUD) problem in uplink grant-free
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where the access point has to identify
the total number and correct identity of the active Internet of Things (IoT)
devices and decode their transmitted data. We assume that IoT devices use
complex spreading sequences and transmit information in a random-access manner
following the burst-sparsity model, where some IoT devices transmit their data
in multiple adjacent time slots with a high probability, while others transmit
only once during a frame. Exploiting the temporal correlation, we propose an
attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to solve
the MUD problem. The BiLSTM network creates a pattern of the device activation
history using forward and reverse pass LSTMs, whereas the attention mechanism
provides essential context to the device activation points. By doing so, a
hierarchical pathway is followed for detecting active devices in a grant-free
scenario. Then, by utilising the complex spreading sequences, blind data
detection for the estimated active devices is performed. The proposed framework
does not require prior knowledge of device sparsity levels and channels for
performing MUD. The results show that the proposed network achieves better
performance compared to existing benchmark schemes.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a goodness-of-fit measure for probability densities modeling
observations with varying dimensionality, such as text documents of differing
lengths or variable-length sequences. The proposed measure is an instance of
the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which has been used to construct
goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalized densities. The KSD is defined by its
Stein operator: current operators used in testing apply to fixed-dimensional
spaces. As our main contribution, we extend the KSD to the variable-dimension
setting by identifying appropriate Stein operators, and propose a novel KSD
goodness-of-fit test. As with the previous variants, the proposed KSD does not
require the density to be normalized, allowing the evaluation of a large class
of models. Our test is shown to perform well in practice on discrete sequential
data benchmarks.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14905</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning is an important problem for knowledge graphs.
In this paper, we propose a novel and principled framework called \textbf{RulE}
(stands for {Rul}e {E}mbedding) to effectively leverage logical rules to
enhance KG reasoning. Unlike knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods, RulE
learns rule embeddings from existing triplets and first-order {rules} by
jointly representing \textbf{entities}, \textbf{relations} and \textbf{logical
rules} in a unified embedding space. Based on the learned rule embeddings, a
confidence score can be calculated for each rule, reflecting its consistency
with the observed triplets. This allows us to perform logical rule inference in
a soft way, thus alleviating the brittleness of logic. On the other hand, RulE
injects prior logical rule information into the embedding space, enriching and
regularizing the entity/relation embeddings. This makes KGE alone perform
better too. RulE is conceptually simple and empirically effective. We conduct
extensive experiments to verify each component of RulE. Results on multiple
benchmarks reveal that our model outperforms the majority of existing
embedding-based and rule-based approaches.

to interpolate between the numerical model states, dramatically lowering the
modeling time while maintaining a high generation accuracy. As a demonstration
of this concept, we present BioMime, a hybrid-structured generative model that
enables an accurate, ultra-fast, and arbitrarily high temporal-resolution
simulation of a specific biophysical system during dynamic changes. This
methodology has wide applications in physiological and clinical research as
well as in supporting data augmentation strategies for signal analysis,

from low-level policies guided by a sampling-based Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)
planner. We demonstrate that our framework can solve long-horizon navigation
tasks using only local information. We evaluate our approach on
partially-observed maze navigation with MuJoCo robots, including Ant, Point,
and Humanoid. We show that Control Transformer can successfully navigate
through mazes and transfer to unknown environments. Additionally, we apply our
method to a differential drive robot (Turtlebot3) and show zero-shot sim2real
transfer under noisy observations.

<title>The Effectiveness of World Models for Continual Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2211.15944v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15944</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;World models power some of the most efficient reinforcement learning
algorithms. In this work, we showcase that they can be harnessed for continual
learning - a situation when the agent faces changing environments. World models
typically employ a replay buffer for training, which can be naturally extended
to continual learning. We systematically study how different selective
experience replay methods affect performance, forgetting, and transfer. We also
provide recommendations regarding various modeling options for using world
models. The best set of choices is called Continual-Dreamer, it is
task-agnostic and utilizes the world model for continual exploration.
Continual-Dreamer is sample efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art
task-agnostic continual reinforcement learning methods on Minigrid and Minihack
benchmarks.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With the vast data-collecting capabilities of current and future high-energy
collider experiments, there is an increasing demand for computationally
efficient simulations. Generative machine learning models enable fast event
generation, yet so far these approaches are largely constrained to fixed data
structures and rigid detector geometries. In this paper, we introduce EPiC-GAN
- equivariant point cloud generative adversarial network - which can produce
point clouds of variable multiplicity. This flexible framework is based on deep
sets and is well suited for simulating sprays of particles called jets. The
generator and discriminator utilize multiple EPiC layers with an interpretable
global latent vector. Crucially, the EPiC layers do not rely on pairwise
information sharing between particles, which leads to a significant speed-up
over graph- and transformer-based approaches with more complex relation
diagrams. We demonstrate that EPiC-GAN scales well to large particle
multiplicities and achieves high generation fidelity on benchmark jet

<title>A Deep Learning Method for Comparing Bayesian Hierarchical Models. (arXiv:2301.11873v3 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11873</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian model comparison (BMC) offers a principled approach for assessing
the relative merits of competing computational models and propagating
uncertainty into model selection decisions. However, BMC is often intractable
for the popular class of hierarchical models due to their high-dimensional
nested parameter structure. To address this intractability, we propose a deep
learning method for performing BMC on any set of hierarchical models which can
be instantiated as probabilistic programs. Since our method enables amortized
inference, it allows efficient re-estimation of posterior model probabilities
and fast performance validation prior to any real-data application. In a series
of extensive validation studies, we benchmark the performance of our method
against the state-of-the-art bridge sampling method and demonstrate excellent
amortized inference across all BMC settings. We then showcase our method by
comparing four hierarchical evidence accumulation models that have previously
been deemed intractable for BMC due to partly implicit likelihoods. In this
application, we corroborate evidence for the recently proposed L\&apos;evy flight
model of decision-making and show how transfer learning can be leveraged to
enhance training efficiency. We provide reproducible code for all analyses and
an open-source implementation of our method.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12811</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn a target probability
distribution by optimizing a generator and a discriminator with minimax
objectives. This paper addresses the question of whether such optimization
actually provides the generator with gradients that make its distribution close
to the target distribution. We derive metrizable conditions, sufficient
conditions for the discriminator to serve as the distance between the
distributions by connecting the GAN formulation with the concept of sliced
optimal transport. Furthermore, by leveraging these theoretical results, we
propose a novel GAN training scheme, called slicing adversarial network (SAN).
With only simple modifications, a broad class of existing GANs can be converted
to SANs. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets support our theoretical
results and the SAN&apos;s effectiveness as compared to usual GANs. Furthermore, we
also apply SAN to StyleGAN-XL, which leads to state-of-the-art FID score
amongst GANs for class conditional generation on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00422</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In many industrial applications, obtaining labeled observations is not
straightforward as it often requires the intervention of human experts or the
use of expensive testing equipment. In these circumstances, active learning can
be highly beneficial in suggesting the most informative data points to be used
when fitting a model. Reducing the number of observations needed for model
development alleviates both the computational burden required for training and
the operational expenses related to labeling. Online active learning, in
particular, is useful in high-volume production processes where the decision
about the acquisition of the label for a data point needs to be taken within an
extremely short time frame. However, despite the recent efforts to develop
online active learning strategies, the behavior of these methods in the
presence of outliers has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we
investigate the performance of online active linear regression in contaminated
data streams. Our study shows that the currently available query strategies are
prone to sample outliers, whose inclusion in the training set eventually
degrades the predictive performance of the models. To address this issue, we
propose a solution that bounds the search area of a conditional D-optimal
algorithm and uses a robust estimator. Our approach strikes a balance between
exploring unseen regions of the input space and protecting against outliers.
Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method is effective in
improving the performance of online active learning in the presence of
outliers, thus expanding the potential applications of this powerful tool.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00482</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are an attractive generative modeling
technique, but they have been held back by limitations in their
simulation-based maximum likelihood training. We introduce the generalized
conditional flow matching (CFM) technique, a family of simulation-free training
objectives for CNFs. CFM features a stable regression objective like that used
to train the stochastic flow in diffusion models but enjoys the efficient
inference of deterministic flow models. In contrast to both diffusion models
and prior CNF training algorithms, CFM does not require the source distribution
to be Gaussian or require evaluation of its density. A variant of our objective
is optimal transport CFM (OT-CFM), which creates simpler flows that are more
stable to train and lead to faster inference, as evaluated in our experiments.
Furthermore, OT-CFM is the first method to compute dynamic OT in a
simulation-free way. Training CNFs with CFM improves results on a variety of
conditional and unconditional generation tasks, such as inferring single cell
dynamics, unsupervised image translation, and Schr\&quot;odinger bridge inference.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The modeling of time-varying graph signals as stationary time-vertex
stochastic processes permits the inference of missing signal values by
efficiently employing the correlation patterns of the process across different
graph nodes and time instants. In this study, we propose an algorithm for
computing graph autoregressive moving average (graph ARMA) processes based on
learning the joint time-vertex power spectral density of the process from its
incomplete realizations for the task of signal interpolation. Our solution
relies on first roughly estimating the joint spectrum of the process from
partially observed realizations and then refining this estimate by projecting
it onto the spectrum manifold of the graph ARMA process through convex
relaxations. The initially missing signal values are then estimated based on
the learnt model. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves
high accuracy in time-vertex signal estimation problems.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study the convergence of message passing graph neural networks on random
graph models to their continuous counterpart as the number of nodes tends to
infinity. Until now, this convergence was only known for architectures with
aggregation functions in the form of normalized means, or, equivalently, of an
application of classical operators like the adjacency matrix or the graph
Laplacian. We extend such results to a large class of aggregation functions,
that encompasses all classically used message passing graph neural networks,
such as attention-based message passing, max convolutional message passing or
(degree-normalized) convolutional message passing. Under mild assumptions, we
give non-asymptotic bounds with high probability to quantify this convergence.
Our main result is based on the McDiarmid inequality. Interestingly, this
result does not apply to the case where the aggregation is a coordinate-wise
maximum. We treat this case separately and obtain a different convergence rate.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11336</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Synthetic data has been hailed as the silver bullet for privacy preserving
data analysis. If a record is not real, then how could it violate a person&apos;s
privacy? In addition, deep-learning based generative models are employed
successfully to approximate complex high-dimensional distributions from data
and draw realistic samples from this learned distribution. It is often
overlooked though that generative models are prone to memorising many details
of individual training records and often generate synthetic data that too
closely resembles the underlying sensitive training data, hence violating
strong privacy regulations as, e.g., encountered in health care. Differential
privacy is the well-known state-of-the-art framework for guaranteeing
protection of sensitive individuals&apos; data, allowing aggregate statistics and
even machine learning models to be released publicly without compromising
privacy. The training mechanisms however often add too much noise during the
training process, and thus severely compromise the utility of these private
models. Even worse, the tight privacy budgets do not allow for many training
epochs so that model quality cannot be properly controlled in practice. In this
paper we explore an alternative approach for privately generating data that
makes direct use of the inherent stochasticity in generative models, e.g.,
variational autoencoders. The main idea is to appropriately constrain the
continuity modulus of the deep models instead of adding another noise mechanism
on top. For this approach, we derive mathematically rigorous privacy guarantees
and illustrate its effectiveness with practical experiments.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The coupling of deep reinforcement learning to numerical flow control
problems has recently received a considerable attention, leading to
groundbreaking results and opening new perspectives for the domain. Due to the

attain efficient control in a reasonable time. Yet, most of the deep
reinforcement learning literature for flow control relies on on-policy

theoretical assumptions and lead to suboptimal control models. To overcome this
issue, we propose a parallelism pattern relying on partial-trajectory buffers
terminated by a return bootstrapping step, allowing a flexible use of parallel

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable advancements in the field

<title>Revisiting Generalized p-Laplacian Regularized Framelet GCNs: Convergence, Energy Dynamic and Training with Non-Linear Diffusion. (arXiv:2305.15639v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15639</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the graph
p-Laplacian regularized framelet network (pL-UFG) to establish a solid
understanding of its properties. We conduct a convergence analysis on pL-UFG,
addressing the gap in the understanding of its asymptotic behaviors. Further by
investigating the generalized Dirichlet energy of pL-UFG, we demonstrate that
the Dirichlet energy remains non-zero throughout convergence, ensuring the
avoidance of over-smoothing issues. Additionally, we elucidate the energy
dynamic perspective, highlighting the synergistic relationship between the
implicit layer in pL-UFG and graph framelets. This synergy enhances the model&apos;s
adaptability to both homophilic and heterophilic data. Notably, we reveal that
pL-UFG can be interpreted as a generalized non-linear diffusion process,
thereby bridging the gap between pL-UFG and differential equations on the
graph. Importantly, these multifaceted analyses lead to unified conclusions
that offer novel insights for understanding and implementing pL-UFG, as well as
other graph neural network (GNN) models. Finally, based on our dynamic
analysis, we propose two novel pL-UFG models with manually controlled energy
dynamics. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed models
not only inherit the advantages of pL-UFG but also significantly reduce
computational costs for training on large-scale graph datasets.

<title>Personalization Disentanglement for Federated Learning: An explainable perspective. (arXiv:2306.03570v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03570</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Personalized federated learning (PFL) jointly trains a variety of local
models through balancing between knowledge sharing across clients and model
personalization per client. This paper addresses PFL via explicit disentangling
latent representations into two parts to capture the shared knowledge and
client-specific personalization, which leads to more reliable and effective
PFL. The disentanglement is achieved by a novel Federated Dual Variational
Autoencoder (FedDVA), which employs two encoders to infer the two types of
representations. FedDVA can produce a better understanding of the trade-off
between global knowledge sharing and local personalization in PFL. Moreover, it
can be integrated with existing FL methods and turn them into personalized
models for heterogeneous downstream tasks. Extensive experiments validate the
advantages caused by disentanglement and show that models trained with
disentangled representations substantially outperform those vanilla methods.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large-language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 caught the interest of many
scientists. Recent studies suggested that these models could be useful in
chemistry and materials science. To explore these possibilities, we organized a
hackathon.

<title>Efficient Approximations of Complete Interatomic Potentials for Crystal Property Prediction. (arXiv:2306.10045v5 [physics.chem-ph] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10045</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study property prediction for crystal materials. A crystal structure
consists of a minimal unit cell that is repeated infinitely in 3D space. How to
accurately represent such repetitive structures in machine learning models
remains unresolved. Current methods construct graphs by establishing edges only
between nearby nodes, thereby failing to faithfully capture infinite repeating
patterns and distant interatomic interactions. In this work, we propose several
innovations to overcome these limitations. First, we propose to model
physics-principled interatomic potentials directly instead of only using
distances as in many existing methods. These potentials include the Coulomb
potential, London dispersion potential, and Pauli repulsion potential. Second,
we model the complete set of potentials among all atoms, instead of only
between nearby atoms as in existing methods. This is enabled by our
approximations of infinite potential summations with provable error bounds. We
further develop efficient algorithms to compute the approximations. Finally, we
propose to incorporate our computations of complete interatomic potentials into
message passing neural networks for representation learning. We perform
experiments on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks for evaluation.
Results show that the use of interatomic potentials and complete interatomic
potentials leads to consistent performance improvements with reasonable
computational costs. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library
(https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenMat/PotNet).

<title>TrustGuard: GNN-based Robust and Explainable Trust Evaluation with Dynamicity Support. (arXiv:2306.13339v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13339</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Trust evaluation assesses trust relationships between entities and
facilitates decision-making. Machine Learning (ML) shows great potential for
trust evaluation owing to its learning capabilities. In recent years, Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), as a new ML paradigm, have demonstrated superiority in
dealing with graph data. This has motivated researchers to explore their use in
trust evaluation, as trust relationships among entities can be modeled as a
graph. However, current trust evaluation methods that employ GNNs fail to fully
satisfy the dynamic nature of trust, overlook the adverse effects of attacks on
trust evaluation, and cannot provide convincing explanations on evaluation
results. To address these problems, we propose TrustGuard, a GNN-based accurate
trust evaluation model that supports trust dynamicity, is robust against
typical attacks, and provides explanations through visualization. Specifically,
TrustGuard is designed with a layered architecture that contains a snapshot
input layer, a spatial aggregation layer, a temporal aggregation layer, and a
prediction layer. Among them, the spatial aggregation layer adopts a defense
mechanism to robustly aggregate local trust, and the temporal aggregation layer
applies an attention mechanism for effective learning of temporal patterns.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that TrustGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based trust evaluation models with respect to
trust prediction across single-timeslot and multi-timeslot, even in the
presence of attacks. In addition, TrustGuard can explain its evaluation results
by visualizing both spatial and temporal views.

<title>Hiding in Plain Sight: Differential Privacy Noise Exploitation for Evasion-resilient Localized Poisoning Attacks in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2307.00268v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00268</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Lately, differential privacy (DP) has been introduced in cooperative
multiagent reinforcement learning (CMARL) to safeguard the agents&apos; privacy
against adversarial inference during knowledge sharing. Nevertheless, we argue
that the noise introduced by DP mechanisms may inadvertently give rise to a
novel poisoning threat, specifically in the context of private knowledge
sharing during CMARL, which remains unexplored in the literature. To address
this shortcoming, we present an adaptive, privacy-exploiting, and
evasion-resilient localized poisoning attack (PeLPA) that capitalizes on the
inherent DP-noise to circumvent anomaly detection systems and hinder the
optimal convergence of the CMARL model. We rigorously evaluate our proposed
PeLPA attack in diverse environments, encompassing both non-adversarial and
multiple-adversarial contexts. Our findings reveal that, in a medium-scale
environment, the PeLPA attack with attacker ratios of 20% and 40% can lead to
an increase in average steps to goal by 50.69% and 64.41%, respectively.
Furthermore, under similar conditions, PeLPA can result in a 1.4x and 1.6x
computational time increase in optimal reward attainment and a 1.18x and 1.38x
slower convergence for attacker ratios of 20% and 40%, respectively.

<title>Beyond the Snapshot: Brain Tokenized Graph Transformer for Longitudinal Brain Functional Connectome Embedding. (arXiv:2307.00858v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00858</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Under the framework of network-based neurodegeneration, brain functional
connectome (FC)-based Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have emerged as a valuable
tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). However, these models are tailored for brain FC at a
single time point instead of characterizing FC trajectory. Discerning how FC
evolves with disease progression, particularly at the predementia stages such
as cognitively normal individuals with amyloid deposition or individuals with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is crucial for delineating disease spreading
patterns and developing effective strategies to slow down or even halt disease
advancement. In this work, we proposed the first interpretable framework for
brain FC trajectory embedding with application to neurodegenerative disease
diagnosis and prognosis, namely Brain Tokenized Graph Transformer (Brain
TokenGT). It consists of two modules: 1) Graph Invariant and Variant Embedding
(GIVE) for generation of node and spatio-temporal edge embeddings, which were
tokenized for downstream processing; 2) Brain Informed Graph Transformer
Readout (BIGTR) which augments previous tokens with trainable type identifiers
and non-trainable node identifiers and feeds them into a standard transformer
encoder to readout. We conducted extensive experiments on two public
longitudinal fMRI datasets of the AD continuum for three tasks, including
differentiating MCI from controls, predicting dementia conversion in MCI, and
classification of amyloid positive or negative cognitively normal individuals.
Based on brain FC trajectory, the proposed Brain TokenGT approach outperformed
all the other benchmark models and at the same time provided excellent
interpretability. The code is available at

<title>Towards Safe Autonomous Driving Policies using a Neuro-Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach. (arXiv:2307.01316v2 [cs.RO] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01316</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of driving environments and the presence of diverse road
users pose significant challenges for decision-making in autonomous driving.
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a popular approach to tackle
this problem. However, the application of existing DRL solutions is mainly
confined to simulated environments due to safety concerns, impeding their
deployment in real-world. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a
novel neuro-symbolic model-free DRL approach, called DRL with Symbolic Logics
(DRLSL) that combines the strengths of DRL (learning from experience) and
symbolic first-order logics (knowledge-driven reasoning) to enable safe
learning in real-time interactions of autonomous driving within real
environments. This innovative approach provides a means to learn autonomous
driving policies by actively engaging with the physical environment while
ensuring safety. We have implemented the DRLSL framework in autonomous driving
using the highD dataset and demonstrated that our method successfully avoids
unsafe actions during both the training and testing phases. Furthermore, our
results indicate that DRLSL achieves faster convergence during training and
exhibits better generalizability to new driving scenarios compared to
traditional DRL methods.

<title>Accelerated stochastic approximation with state-dependent noise. (arXiv:2307.01497v2 [math.OC] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01497</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider a class of stochastic smooth convex optimization problems under
rather general assumptions on the noise in the stochastic gradient observation.
As opposed to the classical problem setting in which the variance of noise is
assumed to be uniformly bounded, herein we assume that the variance of
stochastic gradients is related to the &quot;sub-optimality&quot; of the approximate
solutions delivered by the algorithm. Such problems naturally arise in a
variety of applications, in particular, in the well-known generalized linear
regression problem in statistics. However, to the best of our knowledge, none
of the existing stochastic approximation algorithms for solving this class of
problems attain optimality in terms of the dependence on accuracy, problem
parameters, and mini-batch size.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss two non-Euclidean accelerated stochastic approximation
routines--stochastic accelerated gradient descent (SAGD) and stochastic
gradient extrapolation (SGE)--which carry a particular duality relationship. We
show that both SAGD and SGE, under appropriate conditions, achieve the optimal
convergence rate, attaining the optimal iteration and sample complexities
simultaneously. However, corresponding assumptions for the SGE algorithm are
more general; they allow, for instance, for efficient application of the SGE to
statistical estimation problems under heavy tail noises and discontinuous score
functions. We also discuss the application of the SGE to problems satisfying
quadratic growth conditions, and show how it can be used to recover sparse
solutions. Finally, we report on some simulation experiments to illustrate
numerical performance of our proposed algorithms in high-dimensional settings.

<title>Understanding Uncertainty Sampling. (arXiv:2307.02719v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02719</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty sampling is a prevalent active learning algorithm that queries
sequentially the annotations of data samples which the current prediction model
is uncertain about. However, the usage of uncertainty sampling has been largely
heuristic: (i) There is no consensus on the proper definition of &quot;uncertainty&quot;
for a specific task under a specific loss; (ii) There is no theoretical
guarantee that prescribes a standard protocol to implement the algorithm, for
example, how to handle the sequentially arrived annotated data under the
framework of optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent. In
this work, we systematically examine uncertainty sampling algorithms under both
stream-based and pool-based active learning. We propose a notion of equivalent
loss which depends on the used uncertainty measure and the original loss
function and establish that an uncertainty sampling algorithm essentially
optimizes against such an equivalent loss. The perspective verifies the
properness of existing uncertainty measures from two aspects: surrogate
property and loss convexity. Furthermore, we propose a new notion for designing
uncertainty measures called \textit{loss as uncertainty}. The idea is to use
the conditional expected loss given the features as the uncertainty measure.
Such an uncertainty measure has nice analytical properties and generality to
cover both classification and regression problems, which enable us to provide
the first generalization bound for uncertainty sampling algorithms under both
stream-based and pool-based settings, in the full generality of the underlying
model and problem. Lastly, we establish connections between certain variants of
the uncertainty sampling algorithms with risk-sensitive objectives and
distributional robustness, which can partly explain the advantage of
uncertainty sampling algorithms when the sample size is small.

<title>inTformer: A Time-Embedded Attention-Based Transformer for Crash Likelihood Prediction at Intersections Using Connected Vehicle Data. (arXiv:2307.03854v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03854</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The real-time crash likelihood prediction model is an essential component of
the proactive traffic safety management system. Over the years, numerous
studies have attempted to construct a crash likelihood prediction model in
order to enhance traffic safety, but mostly on freeways. In the majority of the
existing studies, researchers have primarily employed a deep learning-based
framework to identify crash potential. Lately, Transformer has emerged as a
potential deep neural network that fundamentally operates through
attention-based mechanisms. Transformer has several functional benefits over
extant deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolution
Neural Network (CNN), etc. Firstly, Transformer can readily handle long-term
dependencies in a data sequence. Secondly, Transformers can parallelly process
all elements in a data sequence during training. Finally, a Transformer does
not have the vanishing gradient issue. Realizing the immense possibility of
Transformers, this paper proposes inTersection-Transformer (inTformer), a
time-embedded attention-based Transformer model that can effectively predict
intersection crash likelihood in real-time. The proposed model was evaluated
using connected vehicle data extracted from INRIX and Center for Advanced
Transportation Technology (CATT) Lab&apos;s Signal Analytics Platform. The data was
parallelly formatted and stacked at different timesteps to develop nine
inTformer models. The best inTformer model achieved a sensitivity of 73%. This
model was also compared to earlier studies on crash likelihood prediction at
intersections and with several established deep learning models trained on the
same connected vehicle dataset. In every scenario, this inTformer outperformed
the benchmark models confirming the viability of the proposed inTformer
architecture.

<title>Large Language Models for Supply Chain Optimization. (arXiv:2307.03875v2 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03875</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Supply chain operations traditionally involve a variety of complex decision
making problems. Over the last few decades, supply chains greatly benefited
from advances in computation, which allowed the transition from manual
processing to automation and cost-effective optimization. Nonetheless, business
operators still need to spend substantial efforts in explaining and
interpreting the optimization outcomes to stakeholders. Motivated by the recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study how this disruptive
technology can help bridge the gap between supply chain automation and human
comprehension and trust thereof. We design OptiGuide -- a framework that
accepts as input queries in plain text, and outputs insights about the
underlying optimization outcomes. Our framework does not forgo the
state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization technology, but rather leverages it
to quantitatively answer what-if scenarios (e.g., how would the cost change if
we used supplier B instead of supplier A for a given demand?). Importantly, our
design does not require sending proprietary data over to LLMs, which can be a
privacy concern in some circumstances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework on a real server placement scenario within Microsoft&apos;s cloud supply
chain. Along the way, we develop a general evaluation benchmark, which can be
used to evaluate the accuracy of the LLM output in other scenarios.

applicability of unsupervised clustering and ProtNets to the task. Finally, we

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05888</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT) is envisioned to
empower various areas as a bridge between physical objects and the digital
world. Through virtualization and simulation techniques, multiple functions can
be achieved by leveraging computing resources. In this process, Mobile Cloud
Computing (MCC) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) have become two of the key
factors to achieve real-time feedback. However, current works only considered
edge servers or cloud servers in the DT system models. Besides, The models
ignore the DT with not only one data resource. In this paper, we propose a new
DT system model considering a heterogeneous MEC/MCC environment. Each DT in the
model is maintained in one of the servers via multiple data collection devices.
The offloading decision-making problem is also considered and a new offloading
scheme is proposed based on Distributed Deep Learning (DDL). Simulation results
demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can effectively and efficiently
decrease the system&apos;s average latency and energy consumption. Significant
improvement is achieved compared with the baselines under the dynamic
environment of DTs.

<title>Filling time-series gaps using image techniques: Multidimensional context autoencoder approach for building energy data imputation. (arXiv:2307.05926v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05926</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Building energy prediction and management has become increasingly important
in recent decades, driven by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and
the availability of more energy data. However, energy data is often collected
from multiple sources and can be incomplete or inconsistent, which can hinder
accurate predictions and management of energy systems and limit the usefulness
of the data for decision-making and research. To address this issue, past
studies have focused on imputing missing gaps in energy data, including random
and continuous gaps. One of the main challenges in this area is the lack of
validation on a benchmark dataset with various building and meter types, making
it difficult to accurately evaluate the performance of different imputation
methods. Another challenge is the lack of application of state-of-the-art
imputation methods for missing gaps in energy data. Contemporary
image-inpainting methods, such as Partial Convolution (PConv), have been widely
used in the computer vision domain and have demonstrated their effectiveness in
dealing with complex missing patterns. To study whether energy data imputation
can benefit from the image-based deep learning method, this study compared
PConv, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and weekly persistence method
using one of the biggest publicly available whole building energy datasets,
consisting of 1479 power meters worldwide, as the benchmark. The results show
that, compared to the CNN with the raw time series (1D-CNN) and the weekly
persistence method, neural network models with reshaped energy data with two
dimensions reduced the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 10% to 30%. The advanced
deep learning method, Partial convolution (PConv), has further reduced the MSE
by 20-30% than 2D-CNN and stands out among all models.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This work establishes provably faster convergence rates for gradient descent
via a computer-assisted analysis technique. Our theory allows nonconstant
stepsize policies with frequent long steps potentially violating descent by
analyzing the overall effect of many iterations at once rather than the typical
one-iteration inductions used in most first-order method analyses. We show that
long steps, which may increase the objective value in the short term, lead to
provably faster convergence in the long term. A conjecture towards proving a
faster $O(1/T\log T)$ rate for gradient descent is also motivated along with
simple numerical validation.
