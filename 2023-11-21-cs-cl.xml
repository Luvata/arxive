<title>VideoCon: Robust Video-Language Alignment via Contrast Captions. (arXiv:2311.10111v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10111</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite being (pre)trained on a massive amount of data, state-of-the-art
video-language alignment models are not robust to semantically-plausible
contrastive changes in the video captions. Our work addresses this by
identifying a broad spectrum of contrast misalignments, such as replacing
entities, actions, and flipping event order, which alignment models should be
robust against. To this end, we introduce the VideoCon, a video-language
alignment dataset constructed by a large language model that generates
plausible contrast video captions and explanations for differences between
original and contrast video captions. Then, a generative video-language model
is finetuned with VideoCon to assess video-language entailment and generate
explanations. Our VideoCon-based alignment model significantly outperforms
current models. It exhibits a 12-point increase in AUC for the video-language
alignment task on human-generated contrast captions. Finally, our model sets
new state of the art zero-shot performance in temporally-extensive
video-language tasks such as text-to-video retrieval (SSv2-Temporal) and video
question answering (ATP-Hard). Moreover, our model shows superior performance
on novel videos and human-crafted captions and explanations. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Hritikbansal/videocon.

<title>Zero-Shot Relational Learning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models. (arXiv:2311.10112v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10112</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In recent years, modeling evolving knowledge over temporal knowledge graphs
(TKGs) has become a heated topic. Various methods have been proposed to
forecast links on TKGs. Most of them are embedding-based, where hidden
representations are learned to represent knowledge graph (KG) entities and
relations based on the observed graph contexts. Although these methods show
strong performance on traditional TKG forecasting (TKGF) benchmarks, they
naturally face a strong challenge when they are asked to model the unseen
zero-shot relations that has no prior graph context. In this paper, we try to
mitigate this problem as follows. We first input the text descriptions of KG
relations into large language models (LLMs) for generating relation
representations, and then introduce them into embedding-based TKGF methods.
LLM-empowered representations can capture the semantic information in the
relation descriptions. This makes the relations, whether seen or unseen, with
similar semantic meanings stay close in the embedding space, enabling TKGF
models to recognize zero-shot relations even without any observed graph
context. Experimental results show that our approach helps TKGF models to
achieve much better performance in forecasting the facts with previously unseen
relations, while still maintaining their ability in link forecasting regarding
seen relations.

<title>JWSign: A Highly Multilingual Corpus of Bible Translations for more Diversity in Sign Language Processing. (arXiv:2311.10174v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10174</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Advancements in sign language processing have been hindered by a lack of
sufficient data, impeding progress in recognition, translation, and production
tasks. The absence of comprehensive sign language datasets across the world&apos;s
sign languages has widened the gap in this field, resulting in a few sign
languages being studied more than others, making this research area extremely
skewed mostly towards sign languages from high-income countries. In this work
we introduce a new large and highly multilingual dataset for sign language
translation: JWSign. The dataset consists of 2,530 hours of Bible translations
in 98 sign languages, featuring more than 1,500 individual signers. On this
dataset, we report neural machine translation experiments. Apart from bilingual
baseline systems, we also train multilingual systems, including some that take
into account the typological relatedness of signed or spoken languages. Our
experiments highlight that multilingual systems are superior to bilingual
baselines, and that in higher-resource scenarios, clustering language pairs
that are related improves translation quality.

<title>The Impact of Familiarity on Naming Variation: A Study on Object Naming in Mandarin Chinese. (arXiv:2311.10181v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10181</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Different speakers often produce different names for the same object or
entity (e.g., &quot;woman&quot; vs. &quot;tourist&quot; for a female tourist). The reasons behind
variation in naming are not well understood. We create a Language and Vision
dataset for Mandarin Chinese that provides an average of 20 names for 1319
naturalistic images, and investigate how familiarity with a given kind of
object relates to the degree of naming variation it triggers across subjects.
We propose that familiarity influences naming variation in two competing ways:
increasing familiarity can either expand vocabulary, leading to higher
variation, or promote convergence on conventional names, thereby reducing
variation. We find evidence for both factors being at play. Our study
illustrates how computational resources can be used to address research
questions in Cognitive Science.

<title>Predictive Minds: LLMs As Atypical Active Inference Agents. (arXiv:2311.10215v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10215</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) like GPT are often conceptualized as passive
predictors, simulators, or even stochastic parrots. We instead conceptualize
LLMs by drawing on the theory of active inference originating in cognitive
science and neuroscience. We examine similarities and differences between
traditional active inference systems and LLMs, leading to the conclusion that,
currently, LLMs lack a tight feedback loop between acting in the world and
perceiving the impacts of their actions, but otherwise fit in the active
inference paradigm. We list reasons why this loop may soon be closed, and
possible consequences of this including enhanced model self-awareness and the
drive to minimize prediction error by changing the world.

<title>A Language and Its Dimensions: Intrinsic Dimensions of Language Fractal Structures. (arXiv:2311.10217v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10217</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The present paper introduces a novel object of study - a language fractal
structure. We hypothesize that a set of embeddings of all $n$-grams of a
natural language constitutes a representative sample of this fractal set. (We
use the term Hailonakea to refer to the sum total of all language fractal
structures, over all $n$). The paper estimates intrinsic (genuine) dimensions
of language fractal structures for the Russian and English languages. To this
end, we employ methods based on (1) topological data analysis and (2) a minimum
spanning tree of a data graph for a cloud of points considered (Steele
theorem). For both languages, for all $n$, the intrinsic dimensions appear to
be non-integer values (typical for fractal sets), close to 9 for both of the
Russian and English language.

<title>Think Twice: Perspective-Taking Improves Large Language Models&apos; Theory-of-Mind Capabilities. (arXiv:2311.10227v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10227</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Human interactions are deeply rooted in the interplay of thoughts, beliefs,
and desires made possible by Theory of Mind (ToM): our cognitive ability to
understand the mental states of ourselves and others. Although ToM may come
naturally to us, emulating it presents a challenge to even the most advanced
Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent improvements to LLMs&apos; reasoning
capabilities from simple yet effective prompting techniques such as
Chain-of-Thought have seen limited applicability to ToM. In this paper, we turn
to the prominent cognitive science theory &quot;Simulation Theory&quot; to bridge this
gap. We introduce SimToM, a novel two-stage prompting framework inspired by
Simulation Theory&apos;s notion of perspective-taking. To implement this idea on
current ToM benchmarks, SimToM first filters context based on what the
character in question knows before answering a question about their mental
state. Our approach, which requires no additional training and minimal
prompt-tuning, shows substantial improvement over existing methods, and our
analysis reveals the importance of perspective-taking to Theory-of-Mind
capabilities. Our findings suggest perspective-taking as a promising direction
for future research into improving LLMs&apos; ToM capabilities.

<title>Latent Feature-based Data Splits to Improve Generalisation Evaluation: A Hate Speech Detection Case Study. (arXiv:2311.10236v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10236</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With the ever-growing presence of social media platforms comes the increased
spread of harmful content and the need for robust hate speech detection
systems. Such systems easily overfit to specific targets and keywords, and
evaluating them without considering distribution shifts that might occur
between train and test data overestimates their benefit. We challenge hate
speech models via new train-test splits of existing datasets that rely on the
clustering of models&apos; hidden representations. We present two split variants
(Subset-Sum-Split and Closest-Split) that, when applied to two datasets using
four pretrained models, reveal how models catastrophically fail on blind spots
in the latent space. This result generalises when developing a split with one
model and evaluating it on another. Our analysis suggests that there is no
clear surface-level property of the data split that correlates with the
decreased performance, which underscores that task difficulty is not always
humanly interpretable. We recommend incorporating latent feature-based splits
in model development and release two splits via the GenBench benchmark.

<title>Diagnosing and Debiasing Corpus-Based Political Bias and Insults in GPT2. (arXiv:2311.10266v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10266</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The training of large language models (LLMs) on extensive, unfiltered corpora
sourced from the internet is a common and advantageous practice. Consequently,
LLMs have learned and inadvertently reproduced various types of biases,
including violent, offensive, and toxic language. However, recent research
shows that generative pretrained transformer (GPT) language models can
recognize their own biases and detect toxicity in generated content, a process
referred to as self-diagnosis. In response, researchers have developed a
decoding algorithm that allows LLMs to self-debias, or reduce their likelihood
of generating harmful text. This study investigates the efficacy of the
diagnosing-debiasing approach in mitigating two additional types of biases:
insults and political bias. These biases are often used interchangeably in
discourse, despite exhibiting potentially dissimilar semantic and syntactic
properties. We aim to contribute to the ongoing effort of investigating the
ethical and social implications of human-AI interaction.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of the `pre-train then fine-tune&apos; paradigm in the NLP
community, existing work quantifying energy costs and associated carbon
emissions has largely focused on language model pre-training. Although a single
pre-training run draws substantially more energy than fine-tuning, fine-tuning
is performed more frequently by many more individual actors, and thus must be
accounted for when considering the energy and carbon footprint of NLP. In order
to better characterize the role of fine-tuning in the landscape of energy and
carbon emissions in NLP, we perform a careful empirical study of the
computational costs of fine-tuning across tasks, datasets, hardware
infrastructure and measurement modalities. Our experimental results allow us to
place fine-tuning energy and carbon costs into perspective with respect to
pre-training and inference, and outline recommendations to NLP researchers and
practitioners who wish to improve their fine-tuning energy efficiency.

<title>Prompt Pool based Class-Incremental Continual Learning for Dialog State Tracking. (arXiv:2311.10271v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10271</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Continual learning is crucial for dialog state tracking (DST) in dialog
systems, since requirements from users for new functionalities are often
encountered. However, most of existing continual learning methods for DST
require task identities during testing, which is a severe limit in real-world
applications. In this paper, we aim to address continual learning of DST in the
class-incremental scenario (namely the task identity is unknown in testing).
Inspired by the recently emerging prompt tuning method that performs well on
dialog systems, we propose to use the prompt pool method, where we maintain a
pool of key-value paired prompts and select prompts from the pool according to
the distance between the dialog history and the prompt keys. The proposed
method can automatically identify tasks and select appropriate prompts during
testing. We conduct experiments on Schema-Guided Dialog dataset (SGD) and
another dataset collected from a real-world dialog application. Experiment
results show that the prompt pool method achieves much higher joint goal
accuracy than the baseline. After combining with a rehearsal buffer, the model
performance can be further improved.

<title>Complementary Advantages of ChatGPTs and Human Readers in Reasoning: Evidence from English Text Reading Comprehension. (arXiv:2311.10344v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10344</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT has shown its great power in text processing, including its reasoning
ability from text reading. However, there has not been any direct comparison
between human readers and ChatGPT in reasoning ability related to text reading.
This study was undertaken to investigate how ChatGPTs (i.e., ChatGPT and
ChatGPT Plus) and Chinese senior school students as ESL learners exhibited
their reasoning ability from English narrative texts. Additionally, we compared
the two ChatGPTs in the reasoning performances when commands were updated
elaborately. The whole study was composed of three reasoning tests: Test 1 for
commonsense inference, Test 2 for emotional inference, and Test 3 for causal
inference. The results showed that in Test 1, the students outdid the two
ChatGPT versions in local-culture-related inferences but performed worse than
the chatbots in daily-life inferences. In Test 2, ChatGPT Plus excelled whereas
ChatGPT lagged behind in accuracy. In association with both accuracy and
frequency of correct responses, the students were inferior to the two chatbots.
Compared with ChatGPTs&apos; better performance in positive emotions, the students
showed their superiority in inferring negative emotions. In Test 3, the
students demonstrated better logical analysis, outdoing both chatbots. In
updating command condition, ChatGPT Plus displayed good causal reasoning
ability while ChatGPT kept unchanged. Our study reveals that human readers and
ChatGPTs have their respective advantages and disadvantages in drawing
inferences from text reading comprehension, unlocking a complementary
relationship in text-based reasoning.

<title>Exploring the Relationship between In-Context Learning and Instruction Tuning. (arXiv:2311.10367v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10367</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In-Context Learning (ICL) and Instruction Tuning (IT) are two primary
paradigms of adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream applications.
However, they are significantly different. In ICL, a set of demonstrations are
provided at inference time but the LLM&apos;s parameters are not updated. In IT, a
set of demonstrations are used to tune LLM&apos;s parameters in training time but no
demonstrations are used at inference time. Although a growing body of
literature has explored ICL and IT, studies on these topics have largely been
conducted in isolation, leading to a disconnect between these two paradigms. In
this work, we explore the relationship between ICL and IT by examining how the
hidden states of LLMs change in these two paradigms. Through carefully designed
experiments conducted with LLaMA-2 (7B and 13B), we find that ICL is implicit
IT. In other words, ICL changes an LLM&apos;s hidden states as if the demonstrations
were used to instructionally tune the model. Furthermore, the convergence
between ICL and IT is largely contingent upon several factors related to the
provided demonstrations. Overall, this work offers a unique perspective to
explore the connection between ICL and IT and sheds light on understanding the
behaviors of LLM.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) has achieved promising results
while relying on sufficient annotation data in a specific domain. However, it
is infeasible to annotate data for each individual domain. We propose to
explore ASTE in the cross-domain setting, which transfers knowledge from a
resource-rich source domain to a resource-poor target domain, thereby
alleviating the reliance on labeled data in the target domain. To effectively
transfer the knowledge across domains and extract the sentiment triplets
accurately, we propose a method named Fine-grained cOntrAstive Learning (FOAL)
to reduce the domain discrepancy and preserve the discriminability of each
category. Experiments on six transfer pairs show that FOAL achieves 6%
performance gains and reduces the domain discrepancy significantly compared
with strong baselines. Our code will be publicly available once accepted.

<title>Bias A-head? Analyzing Bias in Transformer-Based Language Model Attention Heads. (arXiv:2311.10395v1 [cs.CL])</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Transformer-based pretrained large language models (PLM) such as BERT and GPT
have achieved remarkable success in NLP tasks. However, PLMs are prone to
encoding stereotypical biases. Although a burgeoning literature has emerged on
stereotypical bias mitigation in PLMs, such as work on debiasing gender and
racial stereotyping, how such biases manifest and behave internally within PLMs
remains largely unknown. Understanding the internal stereotyping mechanisms may
allow better assessment of model fairness and guide the development of
effective mitigation strategies. In this work, we focus on attention heads, a
major component of the Transformer architecture, and propose a bias analysis
framework to explore and identify a small set of biased heads that are found to
contribute to a PLM&apos;s stereotypical bias. We conduct extensive experiments to
validate the existence of these biased heads and to better understand how they
behave. We investigate gender and racial bias in the English language in two
types of Transformer-based PLMs: the encoder-based BERT model and the
decoder-based autoregressive GPT model. Overall, the results shed light on
understanding the bias behavior in pretrained language models.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10431</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Understanding how humans process natural language has long been a vital
research direction. The field of natural language processing (NLP) has recently
experienced a surge in the development of powerful language models. These
models have proven to be invaluable tools for studying another complex system
known to process human language: the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated
that the features of language models can be mapped to fMRI brain activity. This
raises the question: is there a commonality between information processing in
language models and the human brain? To estimate information flow patterns in a
language model, we examined the causal relationships between different layers.
Drawing inspiration from the workspace framework for consciousness, we
hypothesized that features integrating more information would more accurately
predict higher hierarchical brain activity. To validate this hypothesis, we
classified language model features into two categories based on causal network
measures: &apos;low in-degree&apos; and &apos;high in-degree&apos;. We subsequently compared the
brain prediction accuracy maps for these two groups. Our results reveal that
the difference in prediction accuracy follows a hierarchical pattern,
consistent with the cortical hierarchy map revealed by activity time constants.
This finding suggests a parallel between how language models and the human
brain process linguistic information.

<title>Sinhala-English Word Embedding Alignment: Introducing Datasets and Benchmark for a Low Resource Language. (arXiv:2311.10436v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10436</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Since their inception, embeddings have become a primary ingredient in many
flavours of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks supplanting earlier types
of representation. Even though multilingual embeddings have been used for the
increasing number of multilingual tasks, due to the scarcity of parallel
training data, low-resource languages such as Sinhala, tend to focus more on
monolingual embeddings. Then when it comes to the aforementioned multi-lingual
tasks, it is challenging to utilize these monolingual embeddings given that
even if the embedding spaces have a similar geometric arrangement due to an
identical training process, the embeddings of the languages considered are not
aligned. This is solved by the embedding alignment task. Even in this,
high-resource language pairs are in the limelight while low-resource languages
such as Sinhala which is in dire need of help seem to have fallen by the
wayside. In this paper, we try to align Sinhala and English word embedding
spaces based on available alignment techniques and introduce a benchmark for
Sinhala language embedding alignment. In addition to that, to facilitate the
supervised alignment, as an intermediate task, we also introduce
Sinhala-English alignment datasets. These datasets serve as our anchor datasets
for supervised word embedding alignment. Even though we do not obtain results
comparable to the high-resource languages such as French, German, or Chinese,
we believe our work lays the groundwork for more specialized alignment between
English and Sinhala embeddings.

we propose a novel tool, called CNL2ASP, for translating English sentences
expressed in a controlled natural language (CNL) form into ASP. In particular,
we first provide a definition of the type of sentences allowed by our CNL and
their translation as ASP rules, and then exemplify the usage of the CNL for the
specification of both synthetic and real-world combinatorial problems. Finally,
we report the results of an experimental analysis conducted on the real-world
problems to compare the performance of automatically generated encodings with

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable progress across
various general domains, encounter significant barriers in medicine and
healthcare. This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific
terminologies and the reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these
obstinate issues, we propose a novel Multi-disciplinary Collaboration (MC)
framework for the medical domain that leverages role-playing LLM-based agents
who participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing
LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free and
interpretable framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain
experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a
report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately
making a decision. Our work particularly focuses on the zero-shot scenario, our
results on nine data sets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from
MMLU) establish that our proposed MC framework excels at mining and harnessing
the medical expertise in LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities.
Based on these outcomes, we further conduct a human evaluation to pinpoint and
categorize common errors within our method, as well as ablation studies aimed
at understanding the impact of various factors on overall performance. Our code

<title>Detection of Offensive and Threatening Online Content in a Low Resource Language. (arXiv:2311.10541v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10541</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Hausa is a major Chadic language, spoken by over 100 million people in
Africa. However, from a computational linguistic perspective, it is considered
a low-resource language, with limited resources to support Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks. Online platforms often facilitate social interactions
that can lead to the use of offensive and threatening language, which can go
undetected due to the lack of detection systems designed for Hausa. This study
aimed to address this issue by (1) conducting two user studies (n=308) to
investigate cyberbullying-related issues, (2) collecting and annotating the
first set of offensive and threatening datasets to support relevant downstream
tasks in Hausa, (3) developing a detection system to flag offensive and
threatening content, and (4) evaluating the detection system and the efficacy
of the Google-based translation engine in detecting offensive and threatening
terms in Hausa. We found that offensive and threatening content is quite
common, particularly when discussing religion and politics. Our detection
system was able to detect more than 70% of offensive and threatening content,
although many of these were mistranslated by Google&apos;s translation engine. We
attribute this to the subtle relationship between offensive and threatening
content and idiomatic expressions in the Hausa language. We recommend that
diverse stakeholders participate in understanding local conventions and
demographics in order to develop a more effective detection system. These
insights are essential for implementing targeted moderation strategies to
create a safe and inclusive online environment.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms (SMPs) poses a
significant danger to public health, social cohesion and ultimately democracy.
Previous research has shown how social correction can be an effective way to
curb misinformation, by engaging directly in a constructive dialogue with users
who spread -- often in good faith -- misleading messages. Although professional
fact-checkers are crucial to debunking viral claims, they usually do not engage
in conversations on social media. Thereby, significant effort has been made to
automate the use of fact-checker material in social correction; however, no
previous work has tried to integrate it with the style and pragmatics that are
commonly employed in social media communication. To fill this gap, we present
VerMouth, the first large-scale dataset comprising roughly 12 thousand
claim-response pairs (linked to debunking articles), accounting for both
SMP-style and basic emotions, two factors which have a significant role in
misinformation credibility and spreading. To collect this dataset we used a
technique based on an author-reviewer pipeline, which efficiently combines LLMs
and human annotators to obtain high-quality data. We also provide comprehensive
experiments showing how models trained on our proposed dataset have significant
improvements in terms of output quality and generalization capabilities.

State-of-the-art systems for the detection of such conversational derailment

making such predictions. This model shows clear advantages in performance to
the existing LSTM model we use as a baseline. Additionally, we show that this
impressive performance can be attained through fine-tuning on a relatively
small, novel dataset, particularly after mitigating overfitting issues through
synthetic oversampling techniques. By introducing the first transformer based

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10614</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their great power in language
generation, often encounter challenges when dealing with intricate and
knowledge-demanding queries in specific domains. This paper introduces a novel
approach to enhance LLMs by effectively extracting the relevant knowledge from
domain-specific textual sources, and the adaptive training of a chatbot with
domain-specific inquiries. Our two-step approach starts from training a
knowledge miner, namely LLMiner, which autonomously extracts Question-Answer
pairs from relevant documents through a chain-of-thought reasoning process.
Subsequently, we blend the mined QA pairs with a conversational dataset to
fine-tune the LLM as a chatbot, thereby enriching its domain-specific expertise
and conversational capabilities. We also developed a new evaluation benchmark
which comprises four domain-specific text corpora and associated human-crafted
QA pairs for testing. Our model shows remarkable performance improvement over
generally aligned LLM and surpasses domain-adapted models directly fine-tuned
on domain corpus. In particular, LLMiner achieves this with minimal human
intervention, requiring only 600 seed instances, thereby providing a pathway
towards self-improvement of LLMs through model-synthesized training data.

<title>Rethinking Attention: Exploring Shallow Feed-Forward Neural Networks as an Alternative to Attention Layers in Transformers. (arXiv:2311.10642v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10642</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This work presents an analysis of the effectiveness of using standard shallow
feed-forward networks to mimic the behavior of the attention mechanism in the
original Transformer model, a state-of-the-art architecture for
sequence-to-sequence tasks. We substitute key elements of the attention
mechanism in the Transformer with simple feed-forward networks, trained using
the original components via knowledge distillation. Our experiments, conducted
on the IWSLT2017 dataset, reveal the capacity of these &quot;attentionless
Transformers&quot; to rival the performance of the original architecture. Through
rigorous ablation studies, and experimenting with various replacement network
types and sizes, we offer insights that support the viability of our approach.
This not only sheds light on the adaptability of shallow feed-forward networks
in emulating attention mechanisms but also underscores their potential to
streamline complex architectures for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Chat models are capable of answering a wide range of questions, however, the
accuracy of their responses is highly uncertain. In this research, we propose a
specialized PEFT-MedAware model where we utilize parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) to enhance the Falcon-1b large language model on specialized
MedQuAD data consisting of 16,407 medical QA pairs, leveraging only 0.44% of
its trainable parameters to enhance computational efficiency. The paper adopts
data preprocessing and PEFT to optimize model performance, complemented by a
BitsAndBytesConfig for efficient transformer training. The resulting model was
capable of outperforming other LLMs in medical question-answering tasks in
specific domains with greater accuracy utilizing limited computational
resources making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We propose further improvements through expanded datasets, larger
models, and feedback mechanisms for sustained medical relevancy. Our work
highlights the efficiency gains and specialized capabilities of PEFT in medical
AI, outpacing standard models in precision without extensive resource demands.
The proposed model and data are released for research purposes only.

the understanding and best practices of adapting pretrained language models to
downstream tasks and user preferences. Concretely, we release: (1)
T\&quot;ULU-V2-mix, an improved collection of high-quality instruction datasets; (2)
T\&quot;ULU 2, LLAMA-2 models finetuned on the V2 mixture; (3) T\&quot;ULU 2+DPO, T\&quot;ULU

largest DPO-trained model to date (T\&quot;ULU 2+DPO 70B); (4) CODE T\&quot;ULU 2, CODE
LLAMA models finetuned on our V2 mix that outperform CODE LLAMA and its
instruction-tuned variant, CODE LLAMA-Instruct. Our evaluation from multiple

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Pre-trained Transformers are challenging human performances in many NLP
tasks. The massive datasets used for pre-training seem to be the key to their
success on existing tasks. In this paper, we explore how a range of pre-trained
Natural Language Understanding models perform on definitely unseen sentences
provided by classification tasks over a DarkNet corpus. Surprisingly, results
show that syntactic and lexical neural networks perform on par with pre-trained
Transformers even after fine-tuning. Only after what we call extreme domain
adaptation, that is, retraining with the masked language model task on all the
novel corpus, pre-trained Transformers reach their standard high results. This
suggests that huge pre-training corpora may give Transformers unexpected help
since they are exposed to many of the possible sentences.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08436</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Abstractive summarization systems today produce fluent and relevant output,
but often &quot;hallucinate&quot; statements not supported by the source text. We analyze
the connection between hallucinations and training data, and find evidence that
models hallucinate because they train on target summaries that are unsupported
by the source. Based on our findings, we present PINOCCHIO, a new decoding
method that improves the consistency of a transformer-based abstractive
summarizer by constraining beam search to avoid hallucinations. Given the model
states and outputs at a given step, PINOCCHIO detects likely model
hallucinations based on various measures of attribution to the source text.
PINOCCHIO backtracks to find more consistent output, and can opt to produce no
summary at all when no consistent generation can be found. In experiments, we
find that PINOCCHIO improves the consistency of generation (in terms of F1) by
an average of~67% on two abstractive summarization datasets.

the topics within vaccine-related narratives is crucial to understand the

one of seven categories. Following a data augmentation approach, we first
construct a novel dataset for this new classification task, focusing on the
minority classes. We also make use of fact-checker annotated data. The paper

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Agents capable of carrying out general tasks on a computer can improve
efficiency and productivity by automating repetitive tasks and assisting in
complex problem-solving. Ideally, such agents should be able to solve new
computer tasks presented to them through natural language commands. However,
previous approaches to this problem require large amounts of expert
demonstrations and task-specific reward functions, both of which are
impractical for new tasks. In this work, we show that a pre-trained large
language model (LLM) agent can execute computer tasks guided by natural
language using a simple prompting scheme where the agent Recursively Criticizes
and Improves its output (RCI). The RCI approach significantly outperforms
existing LLM methods for automating computer tasks and surpasses supervised
learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on the MiniWoB++
benchmark. We compare multiple LLMs and find that RCI with the
InstructGPT-3+RLHF LLM is state-of-the-art on MiniWoB++, using only a handful
of demonstrations per task rather than tens of thousands, and without a
task-specific reward function. Furthermore, we demonstrate RCI prompting&apos;s
effectiveness in enhancing LLMs&apos; reasoning abilities on a suite of natural
language reasoning tasks, outperforming chain of thought (CoT) prompting with
external feedback. We find that RCI combined with CoT performs better than
either separately. Our code can be found here:

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17807</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Traditional Korean medicine (TKM) emphasizes individualized diagnosis and
treatment. This uniqueness makes AI modeling difficult due to limited data and
implicit processes. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
medical inference, even without advanced training in medical texts. This study
assessed the capabilities of GPT-4 in TKM, using the Korean National Licensing
Examination for Korean Medicine Doctors (K-NLEKMD) as a benchmark. The
K-NLEKMD, administered by a national organization, encompasses 12 major
subjects in TKM. We optimized prompts with Chinese-term annotation, English
translation for questions and instruction, exam-optimized instruction, and
self-consistency. GPT-4 with optimized prompts achieved 66.18% accuracy,
surpassing both the examination&apos;s average pass mark of 60% and the 40% minimum
for each subject. The gradual introduction of language-related prompts and
prompting techniques enhanced the accuracy from 51.82% to its maximum accuracy.
GPT-4 showed low accuracy in subjects including public health &amp;amp;
medicine-related law, internal medicine (2) which are localized in Korea and
TKM. The model&apos;s accuracy was lower for questions requiring TKM-specialized
knowledge. It exhibited higher accuracy in diagnosis-based and recall-based
questions than in intervention-based questions. A positive correlation was
observed between the consistency and accuracy of GPT-4&apos;s responses. This study
unveils both the potential and challenges of applying LLMs to TKM. These
findings underline the potential of LLMs like GPT-4 in culturally adapted
medicine, especially TKM, for tasks such as clinical assistance, medical
education, and research. But they also point towards the necessity for the
development of methods to mitigate cultural bias inherent in large language
models and validate their efficacy in real-world clinical settings.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Existing evaluations of entity linking systems often say little about how the
system is going to perform for a particular application. There are two
fundamental reasons for this. One is that many evaluations only use aggregate
measures (like precision, recall, and F1 score), without a detailed error
analysis or a closer look at the results. The other is that all of the widely
used benchmarks have strong biases and artifacts, in particular: a strong focus
on named entities, an unclear or missing specification of what else counts as
an entity mention, poor handling of ambiguities, and an over- or
underrepresentation of certain kinds of entities.
&lt;/p&gt;

LLM-generated text have been proposed very recently. However, we discover that
the previous methods fail to function appropriately with code generation tasks
because of the syntactic and semantic characteristics of code. Based on
\citet{Kirchenbauer2023watermark}, we propose a new watermarking method,
Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding (SWEET), that promotes &quot;green&quot;
tokens only at the position with high entropy of the token distribution during
generation, thereby preserving the correctness of the generated code. The
watermarked code is detected by the statistical test and Z-score based on the
entropy information. Our experiments on HumanEval and MBPP show that SWEET
significantly improves the Pareto Frontier between the code correctness and
watermark detection performance. We also show that notable post-hoc detection
methods (e.g. DetectGPT) fail to work well in this task. Finally, we show that
setting a reasonable entropy threshold is not much of a challenge. Code is
available at https://github.com/hongcheki/sweet-watermark.

<title>VisIT-Bench: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Instruction Following Inspired by Real-World Use. (arXiv:2308.06595v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06595</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We introduce VisIT-Bench (Visual InsTruction Benchmark), a benchmark for
evaluation of instruction-following vision-language models for real-world use.
Our starting point is curating 70 &apos;instruction families&apos; that we envision
instruction tuned vision-language models should be able to address. Extending
beyond evaluations like VQAv2 and COCO, tasks range from basic recognition to
game playing and creative generation. Following curation, our dataset comprises
592 test queries, each with a human-authored instruction-conditioned caption.
These descriptions surface instruction-specific factors, e.g., for an
instruction asking about the accessibility of a storefront for wheelchair
users, the instruction-conditioned caption describes ramps/potential obstacles.
These descriptions enable 1) collecting human-verified reference outputs for
each instance; and 2) automatic evaluation of candidate multimodal generations
using a text-only LLM, aligning with human judgment. We quantify quality gaps
between models and references using both human and automatic evaluations; e.g.,
the top-performing instruction-following model wins against the GPT-4 reference
in just 27% of the comparison. VisIT-Bench is dynamic to participate,
practitioners simply submit their model&apos;s response on the project website;
Data, code and leaderboard is available at visit-bench.github.io.

<title>Insights Into the Nutritional Prevention of Macular Degeneration based on a Comparative Topic Modeling Approach. (arXiv:2309.00312v4 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00312</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Topic modeling and text mining are subsets of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) with relevance for conducting meta-analysis (MA) and systematic review
(SR). For evidence synthesis, the above NLP methods are conventionally used for
topic-specific literature searches or extracting values from reports to
automate essential phases of SR and MA. Instead, this work proposes a
comparative topic modeling approach to analyze reports of contradictory results
on the same general research question. Specifically, the objective is to
identify topics exhibiting distinct associations with significant results for
an outcome of interest by ranking them according to their proportional
occurrence in (and consistency of distribution across) reports of significant
effects. The proposed method was tested on broad-scope studies addressing
whether supplemental nutritional compounds significantly benefit macular
degeneration (MD). Four of these were further supported in terms of
effectiveness upon conducting a follow-up literature search for validation
(omega-3 fatty acids, copper, zeaxanthin, and nitrates). The two not supported
by the follow-up literature search (niacin and molybdenum) also had scores in
the lowest range under the proposed scoring system, suggesting that the
proposed methods score for a given topic may be a viable proxy for its degree
of association with the outcome of interest and can be helpful in the search
for potentially causal relationships. These results underpin the proposed
methods potential to add specificity in understanding effects from broad-scope
reports, elucidate topics of interest for future research, and guide evidence
synthesis in a systematic and scalable way. All of this is accomplished while
yielding valuable insights into the prevention of MD.

<title>Targeted Image Data Augmentation Increases Basic Skills Captioning Robustness. (arXiv:2309.15991v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15991</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks typically struggle in generalizing to
out-of-context examples. One reason for this limitation is caused by having
datasets that incorporate only partial information regarding the potential
correlational structure of the world. In this work, we propose TIDA (Targeted
Image-editing Data Augmentation), a targeted data augmentation method focused
on improving models&apos; human-like abilities (e.g., gender recognition) by filling
the correlational structure gap using a text-to-image generative model. More
specifically, TIDA identifies specific skills in captions describing images
(e.g., the presence of a specific gender in the image), changes the caption
(e.g., &quot;woman&quot; to &quot;man&quot;), and then uses a text-to-image model to edit the image
in order to match the novel caption (e.g., uniquely changing a woman to a man
while maintaining the context identical). Based on the Flickr30K benchmark, we
show that, compared with the original data set, a TIDA-enhanced dataset related
to gender, color, and counting abilities induces better performance in several
image captioning metrics. Furthermore, on top of relying on the classical BLEU
metric, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the improvements of our models
against the baseline in different ways. We compared text-to-image generative
models and found different behaviors of the image captioning models in terms of
encoding visual encoding and textual decoding.

<title>CrossCodeEval: A Diverse and Multilingual Benchmark for Cross-File Code Completion. (arXiv:2310.11248v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11248</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Code completion models have made significant progress in recent years, yet
current popular evaluation datasets, such as HumanEval and MBPP, predominantly
focus on code completion tasks within a single file. This over-simplified
setting falls short of representing the real-world software development
scenario where repositories span multiple files with numerous cross-file
dependencies, and accessing and understanding cross-file context is often
required to complete the code correctly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill in this gap, we propose CrossCodeEval, a diverse and multilingual
code completion benchmark that necessitates an in-depth cross-file contextual
understanding to complete the code accurately. CrossCodeEval is built on a
diverse set of real-world, open-sourced, permissively-licensed repositories in
four popular programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, and C#. To create
examples that strictly require cross-file context for accurate completion, we
propose a straightforward yet efficient static-analysis-based approach to
pinpoint the use of cross-file context within the current file.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art code language models like CodeGen
and StarCoder demonstrate that CrossCodeEval is extremely challenging when the
relevant cross-file context is absent, and we see clear improvements when
adding these context into the prompt. However, despite such improvements, the
pinnacle of performance remains notably unattained even with the
highest-performing model, indicating that CrossCodeEval is also capable of
assessing model&apos;s capability in leveraging extensive context to make better
code completion. Finally, we benchmarked various methods in retrieving
cross-file context, and show that CrossCodeEval can also be used to measure the
capability of code retrievers.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce DUMA, a
novel conversational agent framework that embodies a dual-mind mechanism
through the utilization of two generative Large Language Models (LLMs)
dedicated to fast and slow thinking respectively. The fast thinking model
serves as the primary interface for external interactions and initial response
generation, evaluating the necessity for engaging the slow thinking model based
on the complexity of the complete response. When invoked, the slow thinking
model takes over the conversation, engaging in meticulous planning, reasoning,
and tool utilization to provide a well-analyzed response. This dual-mind
configuration allows for a seamless transition between intuitive responses and
deliberate problem-solving processes based on the situation. We have
constructed a conversational agent to handle online inquiries in the real
estate industry. The experiment proves that our method balances effectiveness
and efficiency, and has a significant improvement compared to the baseline.

<title>Uncovering Intermediate Variables in Transformers using Circuit Probing. (arXiv:2311.04354v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04354</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Neural network models have achieved high performance on a wide variety of
complex tasks, but the algorithms that they implement are notoriously difficult
to interpret. In order to understand these algorithms, it is often necessary to
hypothesize intermediate variables involved in the network&apos;s computation. For
example, does a language model depend on particular syntactic properties when
generating a sentence? However, existing analysis tools make it difficult to
test hypotheses of this type. We propose a new analysis technique -- circuit
probing -- that automatically uncovers low-level circuits that compute
hypothesized intermediate variables. This enables causal analysis through
targeted ablation at the level of model parameters. We apply this method to
models trained on simple arithmetic tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness at
(1) deciphering the algorithms that models have learned, (2) revealing modular
structure within a model, and (3) tracking the development of circuits over
training. We compare circuit probing to other methods across these three
experiments, and find it on par or more effective than existing analysis
methods. Finally, we demonstrate circuit probing on a real-world use case,
uncovering circuits that are responsible for subject-verb agreement and
reflexive anaphora in GPT2-Small and Medium.

<title>Data Contamination Quiz: A Tool to Detect and Estimate Contamination in Large Language Models. (arXiv:2311.06233v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06233</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose the Data Contamination Quiz, a simple and effective approach to
detect data contamination in large language models (LLMs) and estimate the
amount of it. Specifically, we frame data contamination detection as a series
of multiple-choice questions. We devise a quiz format wherein three perturbed
versions of each dataset instance are created. These changes only include
word-level perturbations, replacing words with their contextual synonyms,
ensuring both the semantic and sentence structure remain exactly the same as
the original instance. Together with the original instance, these perturbed
versions constitute the choices in the quiz. Given that the only distinguishing
signal among these choices is the exact wording, an LLM, when tasked with
identifying the original instance from the choices, opts for the original if it
has memorized it in its pre-training phase--a trait intrinsic to LLMs. A
dataset partition is then marked as contaminated if the LLM&apos;s performance on
the quiz surpasses what random chance suggests. Our evaluation spans seven
datasets and their respective splits (train and test/validation) on two
state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. While lacking access to the
pre-training data, our results suggest that our approach not only enhances the
detection of data contamination but also provides an accurate estimation of its
extent, even when the contamination signal is weak.

<title>In-context Vectors: Making In Context Learning More Effective and Controllable Through Latent Space Steering. (arXiv:2311.06668v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06668</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emergent in-context learning
capabilities, where they adapt to new tasks based on example demonstrations.
However, in-context learning has seen limited effectiveness in many settings,
is difficult to quantitatively control and takes up context window space. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an alternative approach that recasts
in-context learning as in-context vectors (ICV). Using ICV has two steps. We
first use a forward pass on demonstration examples to create the in-context
vector from the latent embedding of the LLM. This vector captures essential
information about the intended task. On a new query, instead of adding
demonstrations to the prompt, we shift the latent states of the LLM using the
ICV. The ICV approach has several benefits: 1) it enables the LLM to more
effectively follow the demonstration examples; 2) it&apos;s easy to control by
adjusting the magnitude of the ICV; 3) it reduces the length of the prompt by
removing the in-context demonstrations; 4) ICV is computationally much more
efficient than fine-tuning. We demonstrate that ICV achieves better performance
compared to standard in-context learning and fine-tuning on diverse tasks
including safety, style transfer, role-playing and formatting. Moreover, we
show that we can flexibly teach LLM to simultaneously follow different types of
instructions by simple vector arithmetics on the corresponding ICVs.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;As Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming prevalent in various fields,
there is an urgent need for improved NLP benchmarks that encompass all the
necessary knowledge of individual discipline. Many contemporary benchmarks for
foundational models emphasize a broad range of subjects but often fall short in
presenting all the critical subjects and encompassing necessary professional
knowledge of them. This shortfall has led to skewed results, given that LLMs
exhibit varying performance across different subjects and knowledge areas. To
address this issue, we present psybench, the first comprehensive Chinese
evaluation suite that covers all the necessary knowledge required for graduate
entrance exams. psybench offers a deep evaluation of a model&apos;s strengths and
weaknesses in psychology through multiple-choice questions. Our findings show
significant differences in performance across different sections of a subject,
highlighting the risk of skewed results when the knowledge in test sets is not
balanced. Notably, only the ChatGPT model reaches an average accuracy above
$70\%$, indicating that there is still plenty of room for improvement. We
expect that psybench will help to conduct thorough evaluations of base models&apos;
strengths and weaknesses and assist in practical application in the field of
psychology.
