<title>Large Language Models in Finance: A Survey. (arXiv:2311.10723v1 [q-fin.GN])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10723</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities
for artificial intelligence applications in finance. In this paper, we provide
a practical survey focused on two key aspects of utilizing LLMs for financial
tasks: existing solutions and guidance for adoption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we review current approaches employing LLMs in finance, including
leveraging pretrained models via zero-shot or few-shot learning, fine-tuning on
domain-specific data, and training custom LLMs from scratch. We summarize key
models and evaluate their performance improvements on financial natural
language processing tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we propose a decision framework to guide financial professionals in
selecting the appropriate LLM solution based on their use case constraints
around data, compute, and performance needs. The framework provides a pathway
from lightweight experimentation to heavy investment in customized LLMs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we discuss limitations and challenges around leveraging LLMs in
financial applications. Overall, this survey aims to synthesize the
state-of-the-art and provide a roadmap for responsibly applying LLMs to advance
financial AI.

<title>Chatbot-supported Thesis Writing: An Autoethnographic Report. (arXiv:2311.10729v1 [cs.CY])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10729</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The release of the large language model based chatbot ChatGPT in November
2022 has brought considerable attention to the subject of artificial
intelligence, not only in the public. From the perspective of higher education,
ChatGPT challenges various learning and assessment formats as it significantly
reduces the effectiveness of their learning and assessment functionalities. In
particular, ChatGPT might be applied to formats that require learners to
generate text, such as bachelor theses or student research papers. Accordingly,
the research question arises to what extent writing of bachelor theses is still
a valid learning and assessment format. Correspondingly, in this study, the
first author was asked to write his bachelor&apos;s thesis exploiting ChatGPT. For
tracing the impact of ChatGPT, methodically an autoethnographic approach was
used. First, all considerations on the potential use of ChatGPT were documented
in logs and secondly, all ChatGPT chats were logged. Both logs and chat
histories were analyzed and are presented along to the recommendations for
students regarding the use of ChatGPT suggested by Gimpel et al. (2023). In
conclusion, ChatGPT is beneficial in thesis writing during various activities,
such as brainstorming, structuring and text revision. However, there arise
limitations, e.g., in referencing. Thus, ChatGPT requires a continuous
validation of the outcomes generated fostering learning. Currently, ChatGPT is
to be valued as a beneficial tool in thesis writing. However, writing a
conclusive thesis still requires the learner&apos;s meaningful engagement.
Accordingly, writing a thesis is still a valid learning and assessment format.
With further releases of ChatGPT, an increase in capabilities is to be expected
and the research question needs to be reevaluated from time to time.

<title>EIT: Earnest Insight Toolkit for Evaluating Students&apos; Earnestness in Interactive Lecture Participation Exercises. (arXiv:2311.10746v1 [cs.CY])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10746</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In today&apos;s rapidly evolving educational landscape, traditional modes of
passive information delivery are giving way to transformative pedagogical
approaches that prioritize active student engagement. Within the context of
large-scale hybrid classrooms, the challenge lies in fostering meaningful and
active interaction between students and course content. This study delves into
the significance of measuring students&apos; earnestness during interactive lecture
participation exercises. By analyzing students&apos; responses to interactive
lecture poll questions, establishing a clear rubric for evaluating earnestness,
and conducting a comprehensive assessment, we introduce EIT (Earnest Insight
Toolkit), a tool designed to assess students&apos; engagement within interactive
lecture participation exercises - particularly in the context of large-scale
hybrid classrooms. Through the utilization of EIT, our objective is to equip
educators with valuable means of identifying at-risk students for enhancing
intervention and support strategies, as well as measuring students&apos; levels of
engagement with course content.

<title>Measuring Five Accountable Talk Moves to Improve Instruction at Scale. (arXiv:2311.10749v1 [cs.CY])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10749</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Providing consistent, individualized feedback to teachers on their
instruction can improve student learning outcomes. Such feedback can especially
benefit novice instructors who teach on online platforms and have limited
access to instructional training. To build scalable measures of instruction, we
fine-tune RoBERTa and GPT models to identify five instructional talk moves
inspired by accountable talk theory: adding on, connecting, eliciting, probing
and revoicing students&apos; ideas. We fine-tune these models on a newly annotated
dataset of 2500 instructor utterances derived from transcripts of small group
instruction in an online computer science course, Code in Place. Although we
find that GPT-3 consistently outperforms RoBERTa in terms of precision, its
recall varies significantly. We correlate the instructors&apos; use of each talk
move with indicators of student engagement and satisfaction, including
students&apos; section attendance, section ratings, and assignment completion rates.
We find that using talk moves generally correlates positively with student
outcomes, and connecting student ideas has the largest positive impact. These
results corroborate previous research on the effectiveness of accountable talk
moves and provide exciting avenues for using these models to provide
instructors with useful, scalable feedback.

<title>ProAgent: From Robotic Process Automation to Agentic Process Automation. (arXiv:2311.10751v1 [cs.RO])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10751</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;From ancient water wheels to robotic process automation (RPA), automation
technology has evolved throughout history to liberate human beings from arduous
tasks. Yet, RPA struggles with tasks needing human-like intelligence,
especially in elaborate design of workflow construction and dynamic
decision-making in workflow execution. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have
emerged human-like intelligence, this paper introduces Agentic Process
Automation (APA), a groundbreaking automation paradigm using LLM-based agents
for advanced automation by offloading the human labor to agents associated with
construction and execution. We then instantiate ProAgent, an LLM-based agent
designed to craft workflows from human instructions and make intricate
decisions by coordinating specialized agents. Empirical experiments are
conducted to detail its construction and execution procedure of workflow,
showcasing the feasibility of APA, unveiling the possibility of a new paradigm
of automation driven by agents. Our code is public at

<title>How Contentious Terms About People and Cultures are Used in Linked Open Data. (arXiv:2311.10757v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10757</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Web resources in linked open data (LOD) are comprehensible to humans through
literal textual values attached to them, such as labels, notes, or comments.
Word choices in literals may not always be neutral. When outdated and
culturally stereotyping terminology is used in literals, they may appear as
offensive to users in interfaces and propagate stereotypes to algorithms
trained on them. We study how frequently and in which literals contentious
terms about people and cultures occur in LOD and whether there are attempts to
mark the usage of such terms. For our analysis, we reuse English and Dutch
terms from a knowledge graph that provides opinions of experts from the
cultural heritage domain about terms&apos; contentiousness. We inspect occurrences
of these terms in four widely used datasets: Wikidata, The Getty Art &amp;amp;
Architecture Thesaurus, Princeton WordNet, and Open Dutch WordNet. Some terms
are ambiguous and contentious only in particular senses. Applying word sense
disambiguation, we generate a set of literals relevant to our analysis. We
found that outdated, derogatory, stereotyping terms frequently appear in
descriptive and labelling literals, such as preferred labels that are usually
displayed in interfaces and used for indexing. In some cases, LOD contributors
mark contentious terms with words and phrases in literals (implicit markers) or
properties linked to resources (explicit markers). However, such marking is
rare and non-consistent in all datasets. Our quantitative and qualitative
insights could be helpful in developing more systematic approaches to address
the propagation of stereotypes via LOD.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Multi-document summarization (MDS) is a difficult task in Natural Language
Processing, aiming to summarize information from several documents. However,
the source documents are often insufficient to obtain a qualitative summary. We
propose a retriever-guided model combined with non-parametric memory for
summary generation. This model retrieves relevant candidates from a database
and then generates the summary considering the candidates with a copy mechanism
and the source documents. The retriever is implemented with Approximate Nearest

MultiXScience dataset which includes scientific articles. Finally, we discuss
our results and possible directions for future work.

<title>Comparing Generalization in Learning with Limited Numbers of Exemplars: Transformer vs. RNN in Attractor Dynamics. (arXiv:2311.10763v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10763</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, a widely-recognized large language model (LLM), has recently gained
substantial attention for its performance scaling, attributed to the billions
of web-sourced natural language sentences used for training. Its underlying
architecture, Transformer, has found applications across diverse fields,
including video, audio signals, and robotic movement. %The crucial question
this raises concerns the Transformer&apos;s generalization-in-learning (GIL)
capacity. However, this raises a crucial question about Transformer&apos;s
generalization in learning (GIL) capacity. Is ChatGPT&apos;s success chiefly due to
the vast dataset used for training, or is there more to the story? To
investigate this, we compared Transformer&apos;s GIL capabilities with those of a
traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in tasks involving attractor
dynamics learning. For performance evaluation, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
method has been employed. Our simulation results suggest that under conditions
of limited data availability, Transformer&apos;s GIL abilities are markedly inferior
to those of RNN.

<title>Enhancing Machine Translation through Advanced In-Context Learning: A Methodological Strategy for GPT-4 Improvement. (arXiv:2311.10765v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10765</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The challenge of improving translation accuracy in GPT-4 is being addressed
by harnessing a method known as in-context learning. This paper introduces a
strategic approach to utilize in-context learning specifically for machine
translation, aiming to significantly boost accuracy. The crux of this method
lies in the judicious selection of demonstrations that are most effective for
in-context learning. By selecting these examples carefully, GPT-4 can utilize
them to achieve remarkably accurate machine translations, eliminating the need
for task-specific fine-tuning. This technique is anchored in the semantic
similarities between the user&apos;s prompt and the chosen dataset. Sentences from
this dataset, carefully picked for their relevance and clarity, serve as potent
demonstrations for in-context learning. This approach not only enhances
translation accuracy but also enriches the understanding of nuanced linguistic
structures. It represents a significant step forward in machine learning,
leveraging the inherent capabilities of GPT-4 to provide translations that are
not only accurate but also contextually rich and linguistically sophisticated.
This method demonstrates the potential of in-context learning in overcoming
language barriers, opening new avenues for cross-cultural communication and
global collaboration.

<title>Value FULCRA: Mapping Large Language Models to the Multidimensional Spectrum of Basic Human Values. (arXiv:2311.10766v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10766</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted much
attention to value alignment for their responsible development. However, how to
define values in this context remains a largely unexplored question. Existing
work mainly follows the Helpful, Honest, Harmless principle and specifies
values as risk criteria formulated in the AI community, e.g., fairness and
privacy protection, suffering from poor clarity, adaptability and transparency.
Inspired by basic values in humanity and social science across cultures, this
work proposes a novel basic value alignment paradigm and introduces a value
space spanned by basic value dimensions. All LLMs&apos; behaviors can be mapped into
the space by identifying the underlying values, possessing the potential to
address the three challenges. To foster future research, we apply the
representative Schwartz&apos;s Theory of Basic Values as an initialized example and
construct FULCRA, a dataset consisting of 5k (LLM output, value vector) pairs.
Our extensive analysis of FULCRA reveals the underlying relation between basic
values and LLMs&apos; behaviors, demonstrating that our approach not only covers
existing mainstream risks but also anticipates possibly unidentified ones.
Additionally, we present an initial implementation of the basic value
evaluation and alignment, paving the way for future research in this line.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10768</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Scaling up the number of parameters of language models has proven to be an
effective approach to improve performance. For dense models, increasing model
size proportionally increases the model&apos;s computation footprint. In this work,
we seek to aggressively decouple learning capacity and FLOPs through
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style models with large knowledge-rich vocabulary
based routing functions and experts. Our proposed approach, dubbed Mixture of
Word Experts (MoWE), can be seen as a memory augmented model, where a large set
of word-specific experts play the role of a sparse memory. We demonstrate that
MoWE performs significantly better than the T5 family of models with similar
number of FLOPs in a variety of NLP tasks. Additionally, MoWE outperforms
regular MoE models on knowledge intensive tasks and has similar performance to
more complex memory augmented approaches that often require to invoke custom
mechanisms to search the sparse memory.

<title>Automatic Restoration of Diacritics for Speech Data Sets. (arXiv:2311.10771v1 [cs.CL])</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Automatic text-based diacritic restoration models generally have high
diacritic error rates when applied to speech transcripts as a result of domain
and style shifts in spoken language. In this work, we explore the possibility
of improving the performance of automatic diacritic restoration when applied to
speech data by utilizing the parallel spoken utterances. In particular, we use
the pre-trained Whisper ASR model fine-tuned on relatively small amounts of
diacritized Arabic speech data to produce rough diacritized transcripts for the
speech utterances, which we then use as an additional input for a
transformer-based diacritic restoration model. The proposed model consistently
improve diacritic restoration performance compared to an equivalent text-only
model, with at least 5\% absolute reduction in diacritic error rate within the
same domain and on two out-of-domain test sets. Our results underscore the
inadequacy of current text-based diacritic restoration models for speech data
sets and provide a new baseline for speech-based diacritic restoration.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10774</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and their
integration into large multimodal models (LMMs), there has been impressive
progress in zero-shot completion of user-oriented vision-language tasks.
However, a gap remains in the domain of chart image understanding due to the
distinct abstract components in charts. To address this, we introduce a
large-scale MultiModal Chart Instruction (MMC-Instruction) dataset comprising
600k instances supporting diverse tasks and chart types. Leveraging this data,
we develop MultiModal Chart Assistant (MMCA), an LMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on existing chart QA benchmarks. Recognizing the
need for a comprehensive evaluation of LMM chart understanding, we also propose
a MultiModal Chart Benchmark (MMC-Benchmark), a comprehensive human-annotated
benchmark with 9 distinct tasks evaluating reasoning capabilities over charts.
Extensive experiments on MMC-Benchmark reveal the limitations of existing LMMs
on correctly interpreting charts, even for the most recent GPT-4V model. Our
work provides an instruction-tuning methodology and benchmark to advance
multimodal understanding of charts.

introduces ToolTalk, a benchmark consisting of complex user intents requiring
multi-step tool usage specified through dialogue. ToolTalk contains 28 tools
grouped into 7 plugins, and includes a complete simulated implementation of
each tool, allowing for fully automated evaluation of assistants that rely on
execution feedback. ToolTalk also emphasizes tools that externally affect the
world rather than only tools for referencing or searching information. We
evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on ToolTalk resulting in success rates of 26% and

<title>A Systematic Review of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA): Domains, Methods, and Trends. (arXiv:2311.10777v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10777</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a type of fine-grained sentiment
analysis (SA) that identifies aspects and the associated opinions from a given
text. In the digital era, ABSA gained increasing popularity and applications in
mining opinionated text data to obtain insights and support decisions. ABSA
research employs linguistic, statistical, and machine-learning approaches and
utilises resources such as labelled datasets, aspect and sentiment lexicons and
ontology. By its nature, ABSA is domain-dependent and can be sensitive to the
impact of misalignment between the resource and application domains. However,
to our knowledge, this topic has not been explored by the existing ABSA
literature reviews. In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature Review
(SLR) of ABSA studies with a focus on the research application domain, dataset
domain, and the research methods to examine their relationships and identify
trends over time. Our results suggest a number of potential systemic issues in
the ABSA research literature, including the predominance of the
``product/service review&apos;&apos; dataset domain among the majority of studies that
did not have a specific research application domain, coupled with the
prevalence of dataset-reliant methods such as supervised machine learning. This
review makes a number of unique contributions to the ABSA research field: 1) To
our knowledge, it is the first SLR that links the research domain, dataset
domain, and research method through a systematic perspective; 2) it is one of
the largest scoped SLR on ABSA, with 519 eligible studies filtered from 4191
search results without time constraint; and 3) our review methodology adopted
an innovative automatic filtering process based on PDF-mining, which enhanced
screening quality and reliability. Suggestions and our review limitations are
also discussed.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the context of information systems, text sanitization techniques are used
to identify and remove sensitive data to comply with security and regulatory
requirements. Even though many methods for privacy preservation have been
proposed, most of them are focused on the detection of entities from specific
domains (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers), lacking
generality and requiring customization for each desirable domain. Moreover,
removing words is, in general, a drastic measure, as it can degrade text
coherence and contextual information. Less severe measures include substituting
a word for a safe alternative, yet it can be challenging to automatically find
meaningful substitutions. We present a zero-shot text sanitization technique
that detects and substitutes potentially sensitive information using Large

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;LLMs such as ChatGPT and PaLM can be utilized to train on a new language and

cost-effective solutions to both of the aforementioned challenges. We introduce
the Multilingual Instruction-Tuning Dataset (MITS), which is comprised of the

Also, we propose a new method called \emph{TaCo: Translation-Assisted

to instruction-tune LLMs on a new languages through a curriculum learning
process. As a proof of concept, we experimented with the instruction-tuned
Guanaco-33B model and performed further instruction tuning using the TaCo
method in three low-resource languages and one high-resource language. Our
results show that the TaCo method impresses the GPT-4 with 82% for a
low-resource language in the Vicuna Benchmark dataset, and boosts performance
by double in contrast to the performance of instruction tuning only. Our
results show that TaCo is a promising method for creating multilingual LLMs,
even for low-resource languages. We have released our datasets and the model
adapters, and encourage the research community to make use of these resources
towards advancing work on multilingual LLMs.

<title>A Language Agent for Autonomous Driving. (arXiv:2311.10813v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10813</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Human-level driving is an ultimate goal of autonomous driving. Conventional
approaches formulate autonomous driving as a perception-prediction-planning
framework, yet their systems do not capitalize on the inherent reasoning
ability and experiential knowledge of humans. In this paper, we propose a
fundamental paradigm shift from current pipelines, exploiting Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a cognitive agent to integrate human-like intelligence into
autonomous driving systems. Our approach, termed Agent-Driver, transforms the
traditional autonomous driving pipeline by introducing a versatile tool library
accessible via function calls, a cognitive memory of common sense and
experiential knowledge for decision-making, and a reasoning engine capable of
chain-of-thought reasoning, task planning, motion planning, and
self-reflection. Powered by LLMs, our Agent-Driver is endowed with intuitive
common sense and robust reasoning capabilities, thus enabling a more nuanced,
human-like approach to autonomous driving. We evaluate our approach on the
large-scale nuScenes benchmark, and extensive experiments substantiate that our
Agent-Driver significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art driving methods by
a large margin. Our approach also demonstrates superior interpretability and
few-shot learning ability to these methods. Project page:

<title>Labeling Indoor Scenes with Fusion of Out-of-the-Box Perception Models. (arXiv:2311.10883v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10883</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The image annotation stage is a critical and often the most time-consuming
part required for training and evaluating object detection and semantic
segmentation models. Deployment of the existing models in novel environments
often requires detecting novel semantic classes not present in the training
data. Furthermore, indoor scenes contain significant viewpoint variations,
which need to be handled properly by trained perception models. We propose to
leverage the recent advancements in state-of-the-art models for bottom-up
segmentation (SAM), object detection (Detic), and semantic segmentation
(MaskFormer), all trained on large-scale datasets. We aim to develop a
cost-effective labeling approach to obtain pseudo-labels for semantic
segmentation and object instance detection in indoor environments, with the
ultimate goal of facilitating the training of lightweight models for various
downstream tasks. We also propose a multi-view labeling fusion stage, which
considers the setting where multiple views of the scenes are available and can
be used to identify and rectify single-view inconsistencies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach on the Active Vision dataset and the
ADE20K dataset. We evaluate the quality of our labeling process by comparing it
with human annotations. Also, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained
labels in downstream tasks such as object goal navigation and part discovery.
In the context of object goal navigation, we depict enhanced performance using
this fusion approach compared to a zero-shot baseline that utilizes large
monolithic vision-language pre-trained models.

arbitrary NLP classifiers. We formulate the problem of finding a succinct and
non-redundant set of such patterns in terms of the Minimum Description Length
principle. Through an extensive set of experiments, we show that our method,
Premise, performs well in practice. Unlike existing solutions, it recovers
ground truth, even on highly imbalanced data over large vocabularies. In VQA

that suggests the most likely subheadings (i.e., the first six digits) of the
HS code. The model also provides reasoning for its suggestion in the form of a
document that is interpretable by customs officers. We evaluated the model
using 5,000 cases that recently received a classification request. The results
showed that the top-3 suggestions made by our model had an accuracy of 93.9\%
when classifying 925 challenging subheadings. A user study with 32 customs

<title>Representing visual classification as a linear combination of words. (arXiv:2311.10933v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10933</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Explainability is a longstanding challenge in deep learning, especially in
high-stakes domains like healthcare. Common explainability methods highlight
image regions that drive an AI model&apos;s decision. Humans, however, heavily rely
on language to convey explanations of not only &quot;where&quot; but &quot;what&quot;.
Additionally, most explainability approaches focus on explaining individual AI
predictions, rather than describing the features used by an AI model in
general. The latter would be especially useful for model and dataset auditing,
and potentially even knowledge generation as AI is increasingly being used in
novel tasks. Here, we present an explainability strategy that uses a
vision-language model to identify language-based descriptors of a visual
classification task. By leveraging a pre-trained joint embedding space between
images and text, our approach estimates a new classification task as a linear
combination of words, resulting in a weight for each word that indicates its
alignment with the vision-based classifier. We assess our approach using two
medical imaging classification tasks, where we find that the resulting
descriptors largely align with clinical knowledge despite a lack of
domain-specific language training. However, our approach also identifies the
potential for &apos;shortcut connections&apos; in the public datasets used. Towards a
functional measure of explainability, we perform a pilot reader study where we
find that the AI-identified words can enable non-expert humans to perform a
specialized medical task at a non-trivial level. Altogether, our results
emphasize the potential of using multimodal foundational models to deliver
intuitive, language-based explanations of visual tasks.

of the transformer which involves freezing the weights of selected layers after

recent advancements, which can be attributed to the usage of pretrained
language models, the generation of diverse and coherent dialogue remains an
open research problem. A popular approach to address this issue involves the
adaptation of variational frameworks. However, while these approaches
successfully improve diversity, they tend to compromise on contextual
coherence. Hence, we propose the Bayesian Open-domain Dialogue with Empirical
Bayes (BODEB) framework, an empirical bayes framework for constructing an
Bayesian open-domain dialogue agent by leveraging pretrained parameters to
inform the prior and posterior parameter distributions. Empirical results show
that BODEB achieves better results in terms of both diversity and coherence
compared to variational frameworks.

<title>Journey of Hallucination-minimized Generative AI Solutions for Financial Decision Makers. (arXiv:2311.10961v1 [cs.CL])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10961</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Generative AI has significantly reduced the entry barrier to the domain of AI
owing to the ease of use and core capabilities of automation, translation, and
intelligent actions in our day to day lives. Currently, Large language models
(LLMs) that power such chatbots are being utilized primarily for their
automation capabilities for software monitoring, report generation etc. and for
specific personalized question answering capabilities, on a limited scope and
scale. One major limitation of the currently evolving family of LLMs is
&apos;hallucinations&apos;, wherein inaccurate responses are reported as factual.
Hallucinations are primarily caused by biased training data, ambiguous prompts
and inaccurate LLM parameters, and they majorly occur while combining
mathematical facts with language-based context. Thus, monitoring and
controlling for hallucinations becomes necessary when designing solutions that
are meant for decision makers. In this work we present the three major stages
in the journey of designing hallucination-minimized LLM-based solutions that
are specialized for the decision makers of the financial domain, namely:
prototyping, scaling and LLM evolution using human feedback. These three stages
and the novel data to answer generation modules presented in this work are
necessary to ensure that the Generative AI chatbots, autonomous reports and
alerts are reliable and high-quality to aid key decision-making processes.

<title>Behavior Optimized Image Generation. (arXiv:2311.10995v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10995</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The last few years have witnessed great success on image generation, which
has crossed the acceptance thresholds of aesthetics, making it directly
applicable to personal and commercial applications. However, images, especially
in marketing and advertising applications, are often created as a means to an
end as opposed to just aesthetic concerns. The goal can be increasing sales,
getting more clicks, likes, or image sales (in the case of stock businesses).
Therefore, the generated images need to perform well on these key performance
indicators (KPIs), in addition to being aesthetically good. In this paper, we
make the first endeavor to answer the question of &quot;How can one infuse the
knowledge of the end-goal within the image generation process itself to create
not just better-looking images but also &quot;better-performing&apos;&apos; images?&apos;&apos;. We
propose BoigLLM, an LLM that understands both image content and user behavior.
BoigLLM knows how an image should look to get a certain required KPI. We show
that BoigLLM outperforms 13x larger models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in this
task, demonstrating that while these state-of-the-art models can understand
images, they lack information on how these images perform in the real world. To
generate actual pixels of behavior-conditioned images, we train a
diffusion-based model (BoigSD) to align with a proposed BoigLLM-defined reward.
We show the performance of the overall pipeline on two datasets covering two
different behaviors: a stock dataset with the number of forward actions as the
KPI and a dataset containing tweets with the total likes as the KPI, denoted as
BoigBench. To advance research in the direction of utility-driven image
generation and understanding, we release BoigBench, a benchmark dataset
containing 168 million enterprise tweets with their media, brand account names,
time of post, and total likes.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Every human has their own name, a fundamental aspect of their identity and

be applied to practical applications. Hence, this work presents a novel dataset
for Japanese name gender detection comprising 64,139 full names in romaji,
hiragana, and kanji forms, along with their biological genders. Moreover, we
propose Gendec, a framework for gender detection from Japanese names that
leverages diverse approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Multimodal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotions for each utterance
of multiple modalities, which has received increasing attention for its
application in human-machine interaction. Current graph-based methods fail to
simultaneously depict global contextual features and local diverse uni-modal

increasing, they easily fall into over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a
method for joint modality fusion and graph contrastive learning for multimodal
emotion recognition (Joyful), where multimodality fusion, contrastive learning,
and emotion recognition are jointly optimized. Specifically, we first design a
new multimodal fusion mechanism that can provide deep interaction and fusion
between the global contextual and uni-modal specific features. Then, we
introduce a graph contrastive learning framework with inter-view and intra-view
contrastive losses to learn more distinguishable representations for samples
with different sentiments. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
indicate that Joyful achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to
all baselines.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11012</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While Large Language Models (LLMs) become ever more dominant, classic
pre-trained word embeddings sustain their relevance through computational
efficiency and nuanced linguistic interpretation. Drawing from recent studies
demonstrating that the convergence of GloVe and word2vec optimizations all tend
towards log-co-occurrence matrix variants, we construct a novel word
representation system called Bit-cipher that eliminates the need of
backpropagation while leveraging contextual information and hyper-efficient
dimensionality reduction techniques based on unigram frequency, providing
strong interpretability, alongside efficiency. We use the bit-cipher algorithm
to train word vectors via a two-step process that critically relies on a
hyperparameter -- bits -- that controls the vector dimension. While the first
step trains the bit-cipher, the second utilizes it under two different
aggregation modes -- summation or concatenation -- to produce contextually rich
representations from word co-occurrences. We extend our investigation into
bit-cipher&apos;s efficacy, performing probing experiments on part-of-speech (POS)
tagging and named entity recognition (NER) to assess its competitiveness with
classic embeddings like word2vec and GloVe. Additionally, we explore its
applicability in LM training and fine-tuning. By replacing embedding layers
with cipher embeddings, our experiments illustrate the notable efficiency of
cipher in accelerating the training process and attaining better optima
compared to conventional training paradigms. Experiments on the integration of
bit-cipher embedding layers with Roberta, T5, and OPT, prior to or as a
substitute for fine-tuning, showcase a promising enhancement to transfer
learning, allowing rapid model convergence while preserving competitive
performance.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04765</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The purposes of the CoPaSul toolkit are (1) automatic prosodic annotation and
(2) prosodic feature extraction from syllable to utterance level. CoPaSul
stands for contour-based, parametric, superpositional intonation stylization.
In this framework intonation is represented as a superposition of global and
local contours that are described parametrically in terms of polynomial
coefficients. On the global level (usually associated but not necessarily
restricted to intonation phrases) the stylization serves to represent register
in terms of time-varying F0 level and range. On the local level (e.g. accent
groups), local contour shapes are described. From this parameterization several
features related to prosodic boundaries and prominence can be derived.
Furthermore, by coefficient clustering prosodic contour classes can be obtained
in a bottom-up way. Next to the stylization-based feature extraction also
standard F0 and energy measures (e.g. mean and variance) as well as rhythmic
aspects can be calculated. At the current state automatic annotation comprises:
segmentation into interpausal chunks, syllable nucleus extraction, and
unsupervised localization of prosodic phrase boundaries and prominent
syllables. F0 and partly also energy feature sets can be derived for: standard
measurements (as median and IQR), register in terms of F0 level and range,
prosodic boundaries, local contour shapes, bottom-up derived contour classes,
Gestalt of accent groups in terms of their deviation from higher level prosodic
units, as well as for rhythmic aspects quantifying the relation between F0 and
energy contours and prosodic event rates.

Reassortment among viruses with different hosts can lead to a fatal pandemic.
However, it is difficult to detect the original host of the virus during or

Therefore, early and rapid detection of the viral host would help reduce the
further spread of the virus. We use various machine learning models with
features derived from the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and features
learned from word embedding and word encoding to infer the origin host of
viruses. The results show that the performance of the PSSM-based model reaches

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Text-to-Speech (TTS) has recently seen great progress in synthesizing

monotonic alignments that are crucial for naturalistic speech synthesis. Here,
we propose StyleTTS, a style-based generative model for parallel TTS that can

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Italy is characterized by a one-of-a-kind linguistic diversity landscape in
Europe, which implicitly encodes local knowledge, cultural traditions, artistic
expressions and history of its speakers. However, most local languages and
dialects in Italy are at risk of disappearing within few generations. The NLP
community has recently begun to engage with endangered languages, including
those of Italy. Yet, most efforts assume that these varieties are
under-resourced language monoliths with an established written form and
homogeneous functions and needs, and thus highly interchangeable with each
other and with high-resource, standardized languages. In this paper, we
introduce the linguistic context of Italy and challenge the default
machine-centric assumptions of NLP for Italy&apos;s language varieties. We advocate
for a shift in the paradigm from machine-centric to speaker-centric NLP, and
provide recommendations and opportunities for work that prioritizes languages
and their speakers over technological advances. To facilitate the process, we
finally propose building a local community towards responsible, participatory
efforts aimed at supporting vitality of languages and dialects of Italy.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Few-shot classification has made great strides due to foundation models that,

this approach has high variance both across different sets of few shots (data

problematic not only because it impedes the fair comparison of different
approaches, but especially because it makes few-shot learning too unreliable
for many real-world applications. To alleviate these issues, we make two
contributions for more stable and effective few-shot learning: First, we
propose novel ensembling methods and show that they substantially reduce run
variability. Second, we introduce a new active learning (AL) criterion for data
selection and present the first AL-based approach specifically tailored towards
prompt-based learning. In our experiments, we show that our combined method,
MEAL (Multiprompt finetuning and prediction Ensembling with Active Learning),

by use cases like music, news, and recipe recommendation. We present
TalkTheWalk, which synthesizes realistic high-quality conversational data by

to match a desired target distribution given unlabeled target samples. Due to
the scale and dimensionality of the raw text data, existing methods use simple
heuristics or require human experts to manually curate data. Instead, we extend
the classic importance resampling approach used in low-dimensions for LM data
selection. We propose Data Selection with Importance Resampling (DSIR), an
efficient and scalable framework that estimates importance weights in a reduced
feature space for tractability and selects data with importance resampling
according to these weights. We instantiate the DSIR framework with hashed
n-gram features for efficiency, enabling the selection of 100M documents from
the full Pile dataset in 4.5 hours. To measure whether hashed n-gram features
preserve the aspects of the data that are relevant to the target, we define KL
reduction, a data metric that measures the proximity between the selected
pretraining data and the target on some feature space. Across 8 data selection
methods (including expert selection), KL reduction on hashed n-gram features
highly correlates with average downstream accuracy (r=0.82). When selecting
data for continued pretraining on a specific domain, DSIR performs comparably
to expert curation across 8 target distributions. When pretraining
general-domain models (target is Wikipedia and books), DSIR improves over
random selection and heuristic filtering baselines by 2-2.5% on the GLUE
benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/p-lambda/dsir.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05507</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Text-based game environments are challenging because agents must deal with
long sequences of text, execute compositional actions using text and learn from
sparse rewards. We address these challenges by proposing Language Decision
Transformers (LDTs), a framework that is based on transformer language models
and decision transformers (DTs). Our LDTs extend DTs with 3 components: (1)
exponential tilt to guide the agent towards high obtainable goals, (2) novel
goal conditioning methods yielding better results than the traditional
return-to-go (sum of all future rewards), and (3) a model of future
observations that improves agent performance. LDTs are the first to address
offline RL with DTs on these challenging games. Our experiments show that LDTs
achieve the highest scores among many different types of agents on some of the
most challenging Jericho games, such as Enchanter.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated the ability to perform a variety of natural language processing
(NLP) tasks zero-shot -- i.e., without adaptation on downstream data. Recently,
the debut of ChatGPT has drawn a great deal of attention from the natural
language processing (NLP) community due to the fact that it can generate
high-quality responses to human input and self-correct previous mistakes based
on subsequent conversations. However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can
serve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this
work, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by
evaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task
categories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the
effectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that
ChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g.,
arithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific
tasks such as sequence tagging. We additionally provide in-depth analysis
through qualitative case studies.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08143</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Prompt tuning (PT) which only tunes the embeddings of an additional sequence
of tokens per task, keeping the pre-trained language model (PLM) frozen, has
shown remarkable performance in few-shot learning. Despite this, PT has been
shown to rely heavily on good initialization of the prompt embeddings. In this
work, we study meta prompt tuning (MPT) to systematically explore how
meta-learning can help improve (if it can) cross-task generalization in PT
through learning to initialize the prompt embeddings from other relevant tasks.
We empirically analyze a representative set of meta learning algorithms in a
wide range of adaptation settings with different source/target task
configurations on a large set of few-shot tasks. With extensive experiments and
analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPT. We find the improvement to
be significant particularly on classification tasks. For other kinds of tasks
such as question answering, we observe that while MPT can outperform PT in most
cases, it does not always outperform multi-task learning. We further provide an
in-depth analysis from the perspective of task similarity.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Figures of speech such as metaphors, similes, and idioms are integral parts
of human communication. They are ubiquitous in many forms of discourse,
allowing people to convey complex, abstract ideas and evoke emotion. As
figurative forms are often conveyed through multiple modalities (e.g., both
text and images), understanding multimodal figurative language is an important
AI challenge, weaving together profound vision, language, commonsense and
cultural knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we develop the Image Recognition of Figurative Language (IRFL)
dataset. We leverage human annotation and an automatic pipeline we created to
generate a multimodal dataset, and introduce two novel tasks as a benchmark for
multimodal figurative language understanding. We experimented with
state-of-the-art vision and language models and found that the best (22%)
performed substantially worse than humans (97%). We release our dataset,
benchmark, and code, in hopes of driving the development of models that can
better understand figurative language.

novel narrative tasks in a transparent manner. We design LEAP: a comprehensive
framework that integrates state-of-the-art modeling architectures, training
regimes, and augmentation strategies based on both natural and synthetic
stories. To address the lack of densely annotated training data, we devise a
robust automatic labeler based on few-shot prompting to enhance the augmented
data. Our experiments with in- and out-of-domain tasks reveal insights into the
interplay of different architectures, training regimes, and augmentation

<title>Language-Agnostic Bias Detection in Language Models with Bias Probing. (arXiv:2305.13302v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13302</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Pretrained language models (PLMs) are key components in NLP, but they contain
strong social biases. Quantifying these biases is challenging because current
methods focusing on fill-the-mask objectives are sensitive to slight changes in
input. To address this, we propose a bias probing technique called LABDet, for
evaluating social bias in PLMs with a robust and language-agnostic method. For
nationality as a case study, we show that LABDet `surfaces&apos; nationality bias by
training a classifier on top of a frozen PLM on non-nationality sentiment
detection. We find consistent patterns of nationality bias across monolingual
PLMs in six languages that align with historical and political context. We also
show for English BERT that bias surfaced by LABDet correlates well with bias in
the pretraining data; thus, our work is one of the few studies that directly
links pretraining data to PLM behavior. Finally, we verify LABDet&apos;s reliability
and applicability to different templates and languages through an extensive set
of robustness checks. We publicly share our code and dataset in

language modeling task. We find 8 tasks on which Pythia 12B (Biderman et al.,

tasks (TruthfulQA-MC1, TruthfulQA-MC2, Hindsight Neglect, Memo Trap, and
Pattern Match Suppression) additionally show a consistent relationship whereby
larger language models show a greater decrease in performance the more they are
trained, despite showing standard (positive) scaling overall. This highlights
the importance of testing performance at all relevant benchmarks any time

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14864</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With the increase in the size of large language models (LLMs), we need
compression methods that can reduce the model size while preserving the
generality and zero-shot promptability of the model. This goal is more
ambitious than the typical compression setup, which reduces the model&apos;s size at
the expense of specializing it to a specific end-task. To study this, we
develop a task-agnostic compression pipeline with a large-scale evaluation
comprising language modeling perplexity and 12 zero-shot end-tasks. Our results
show that a simple layer-wise pruning followed by continued language model
pretraining matches or outperforms three existing state-of-the-art baselines
while being 1.5x more computationally efficient. However, unlike typical
task-specialized compression, our best-compressed model significantly
underperforms a similar-sized model trained from scratch. We posit the
half-sized pretrained model as an upper bound for task-agnostic compression and
call for future work to bridge this gap under a reasonable token budget. Our
findings highlight the inadequacy of existing compression methods for LLMs and
establish a requirement for new methods that preserve a model&apos;s generality and
zero-shot promptability under compression. We release our code and evaluation
setup to facilitate reproducibility and help iterate on method design.

<title>Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers. (arXiv:2305.16300v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16300</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language
processing, their attention mechanism&apos;s large memory requirements have limited
their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent
memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the
random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any
token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant
context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model&apos;s attention. In
this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete
context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running
attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent
each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting
relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention
mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach
seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system&apos;s memory
hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We
demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with
Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in
each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method
successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing
for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4. We release the implementation of
landmark attention and the code to reproduce our experiments at

robustness of 11 widely-used adaptation methods across 4 vision-language
datasets under multimodal corruptions. Concretely, we introduce 7 benchmark
datasets, including 96 visual and 87 textual corruptions, to investigate the
robustness of different adaptation methods, the impact of available adaptation
examples, and the influence of trainable parameter size during adaptation. Our
analysis reveals that: 1) Adaptation methods are more sensitive to text
corruptions than visual corruptions. 2) Full fine-tuning does not consistently
provide the highest robustness; instead, adapters can achieve better robustness
with comparable clean performance. 3) Contrary to expectations, our findings
indicate that increasing the number of adaptation data and parameters does not
guarantee enhanced robustness; instead it results in even lower robustness. We
hope this study could benefit future research in the development of robust

models to generate the most suitable style for the text without requiring
reference speech, achieving efficient latent diffusion while benefiting from
the diverse speech synthesis offered by diffusion models. Furthermore, we
employ large pre-trained SLMs, such as WavLM, as discriminators with our novel
differentiable duration modeling for end-to-end training, resulting in improved
speech naturalness. StyleTTS 2 surpasses human recordings on the single-speaker
LJSpeech dataset and matches it on the multispeaker VCTK dataset as judged by
native English speakers. Moreover, when trained on the LibriTTS dataset, our
model outperforms previous publicly available models for zero-shot speaker
adaptation. This work achieves the first human-level TTS on both single and

<title>Text-to-SQL Empowered by Large Language Models: A Benchmark Evaluation. (arXiv:2308.15363v4 [cs.DB] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15363</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for Text-to-SQL
task. However, the absence of a systematical benchmark inhibits the development
of designing effective, efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solutions.
To address this challenge, in this paper, we first conduct a systematical and
extensive comparison over existing prompt engineering methods, including
question representation, example selection and example organization, and with
these experimental results, we elaborate their pros and cons. Based on these
findings, we propose a new integrated solution, named DAIL-SQL, which refreshes
the Spider leaderboard with 86.6% execution accuracy and sets a new bar. To
explore the potential of open-source LLM, we investigate them in various
scenarios, and further enhance their performance with supervised fine-tuning.
Our explorations highlight open-source LLMs&apos; potential in Text-to-SQL, as well
as the advantages and disadvantages of the supervised fine-tuning.
Additionally, towards an efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solution,
we emphasize the token efficiency in prompt engineering and compare the prior
studies under this metric. We hope that our work provides a deeper
understanding of Text-to-SQL with LLMs, and inspires further investigations and
broad applications.

<title>Effective Proxy for Human Labeling: Ensemble Disagreement Scores in Large Language Models for Industrial NLP. (arXiv:2309.05619v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05619</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capability to
generalize across a large number of NLP tasks. For industry applications, it is
imperative to assess the performance of the LLM on unlabeled production data
from time to time to validate for a real-world setting. Human labeling to
assess model error requires considerable expense and time delay. Here we
demonstrate that ensemble disagreement scores work well as a proxy for human
labeling for language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings,
per our evaluation on keyphrase extraction (KPE) task. We measure fidelity of
the results by comparing to true error measured from human labeled ground
truth. We contrast with the alternative of using another LLM as a source of
machine labels, or silver labels. Results across various languages and domains
show disagreement scores provide a better estimation of model performance with
mean average error (MAE) as low as 0.4% and on average 13.8% better than using
silver labels.

<title>A novel approach to measuring patent claim scope based on probabilities obtained from (large) language models. (arXiv:2309.10003v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10003</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This work proposes to measure the scope of a patent claim as the reciprocal
of the self-information contained in this claim. A probability of occurrence of
the claim is obtained from a language model and this probability is used to
compute the self-information. Grounded in information theory, this approach is
based on the assumption that an unlikely concept is more informative than a
usual concept, insofar as it is more surprising. In turn, the more surprising
the information required to defined the claim, the narrower its scope. Five
language models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or
character is assigned an identical probability) to intermediate models (using
average word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2).
Interestingly, the scope resulting from the simplest language models is
proportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in
the claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to
multiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each
series consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The
performance of the language models is assessed with respect to several ad hoc
tests. The more sophisticated the model, the better the results. I.e., the GPT2
probability model outperforms models based on word and character frequencies,
which themselves outdo the simplest models based on word or character counts.
Still, the character count appears to be a more reliable indicator than the
word count.

<title>From Large Language Models to Knowledge Graphs for Biomarker Discovery in Cancer. (arXiv:2310.08365v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08365</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Domain experts often rely on most recent knowledge for apprehending and
disseminating specific biological processes that help them design strategies
for developing prevention and therapeutic decision-making in various disease
scenarios. A challenging scenarios for artificial intelligence (AI) is using
biomedical data (e.g., texts, imaging, omics, and clinical) to provide
diagnosis and treatment recommendations for cancerous conditions.~Data and
knowledge about biomedical entities like cancer, drugs, genes, proteins, and
their mechanism is spread across structured (knowledge bases (KBs)) and
unstructured (e.g., scientific articles) sources. A large-scale knowledge graph
(KG) can be constructed by integrating and extracting facts about semantically
interrelated entities and relations. Such a KG not only allows exploration and
question answering (QA) but also enables domain experts to deduce new
knowledge. However, exploring and querying large-scale KGs is tedious for
non-domain users due to their lack of understanding of the data assets and
semantic technologies. In this paper, we develop a domain KG to leverage
cancer-specific biomarker discovery and interactive QA. For this, we
constructed a domain ontology called OncoNet Ontology (ONO), which enables
semantic reasoning for validating gene-disease (different types of cancer)
relations. The KG is further enriched by harmonizing the ONO, metadata,
controlled vocabularies, and biomedical concepts from scientific articles by
employing BioBERT- and SciBERT-based information extractors. Further, since the
biomedical domain is evolving, where new findings often replace old ones,
without having access to up-to-date scientific findings, there is a high chance
an AI system exhibits concept drift while providing diagnosis and treatment.
Therefore, we fine-tune the KG using large language models (LLMs) based on more
recent articles and KBs.

<title>Solving Math Word Problems with Reexamination. (arXiv:2310.09590v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Math word problem (MWP) solving aims to understand the descriptive math
problem and calculate the result, for which previous efforts are mostly devoted
to upgrade different technical modules. This paper brings a different
perspective of \textit{reexamination process} during training by introducing a
pseudo-dual task to enhance the MWP solving. We propose a pseudo-dual (PseDual)
learning scheme to model such process, which is model-agnostic thus can be
adapted to any existing MWP solvers. The pseudo-dual task is specifically
defined as filling the numbers in the expression back into the original word
problem with numbers masked. To facilitate the effective joint learning of the
two tasks, we further design a scheduled fusion strategy for the number
infilling task, which smoothly switches the input from the ground-truth math
expressions to the predicted ones. Our pseudo-dual learning scheme has been
tested and proven effective when being equipped in several representative MWP
solvers through empirical studies. \textit{The codes and trained models are

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09886</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Lifelong sequence generation (LSG), a problem in continual learning, aims to
continually train a model on a sequence of generation tasks to learn constantly
emerging new generation patterns while avoiding the forgetting of previous
knowledge. Existing LSG methods mainly focus on maintaining old knowledge while
paying little attention to knowledge transfer across tasks. In contrast, humans
can better learn new tasks by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from
similar tasks. Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, we propose Dynamic
Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA), which enables the model to dynamically
determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task
correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation
to new tasks. In addition, as the learning process can easily be biased towards
the current task which might cause more severe forgetting of previously learned
knowledge, we propose dynamic gradient scaling to balance the learning of the
current task and replayed tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that DMEA can consistently outperform existing methods in different LSG
settings.

<title>Investigating Uncertainty Calibration of Aligned Language Models under the Multiple-Choice Setting. (arXiv:2310.11732v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11732</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant progress made in practical applications of aligned
language models (LMs), they tend to be overconfident in output answers compared
to the corresponding pre-trained LMs. In this work, we systematically evaluate
the impact of the alignment process on logit-based uncertainty calibration of
LMs under the multiple-choice setting. We first conduct a thoughtful empirical
study on how aligned LMs differ in calibration from their pre-trained
counterparts. Experimental results reveal that there are two distinct
uncertainties in LMs under the multiple-choice setting, which are responsible
for the answer decision and the format preference of the LMs, respectively.
Then, we investigate the role of these two uncertainties on aligned LM&apos;s
calibration through fine-tuning in simple synthetic alignment schemes and
conclude that one reason for aligned LMs&apos; overconfidence is the conflation of
these two types of uncertainty. Furthermore, we examine the utility of common
post-hoc calibration methods for aligned LMs and propose an easy-to-implement
and sample-efficient method to calibrate aligned LMs. We hope our findings
could provide insights into the design of more reliable alignment processes for
LMs.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The remarkable success of GPT models across various tasks, including toponymy

geocoding address parsing task. To ensure that the evaluation more accurately
mirrors performance in real-world scenarios with diverse user input qualities
and resolve the pressing need for a &apos;gold standard&apos; evaluation dataset for
geocoding systems, we introduce a benchmark dataset of low-quality address
descriptions synthesized based on human input patterns mining from actual input
logs of a geocoding system in production. This dataset has 21 different input
errors and variations; contains over 239,000 address records that are uniquely
selected from streets across all U.S. 50 states and D.C.; and consists of three
subsets to be used as training, validation, and testing sets. Building on this,
we train and gauge the performance of the GPT-3 model in extracting address
components, contrasting its performance with transformer-based and LSTM-based
models. The evaluation results indicate that Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model has
achieved the best performance over these transformer-based models and GPT-3
model. Transformer-based models demonstrate very comparable results compared to
the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model. The GPT-3 model, though trailing in
performance, showcases potential in the address parsing task with few-shot

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16676</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is a rapidly evolving task within
the natural language processing community, which aims to detect the emotions
expressed by speakers during a conversation. Recently, a growing number of ERC
methods have focused on leveraging supervised contrastive learning (SCL) to
enhance the robustness and generalizability of learned features. However,
current SCL-based approaches in ERC are impeded by the constraint of large
batch sizes and the lack of compatibility with most existing ERC models. To
address these challenges, we propose an efficient and model-agnostic SCL
framework named Supervised Sample-Label Contrastive Learning with Soft-HGR
Maximal Correlation (SSLCL), which eliminates the need for a large batch size
and can be seamlessly integrated with existing ERC models without introducing
any model-specific assumptions. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective
on utilizing label representations by projecting discrete labels into dense
embeddings through a shallow multilayer perceptron, and formulate the training
objective to maximize the similarity between sample features and their
corresponding ground-truth label embeddings, while minimizing the similarity
between sample features and label embeddings of disparate classes. Moreover, we
innovatively adopt the Soft-HGR maximal correlation as a measure of similarity
between sample features and label embeddings, leading to significant
performance improvements over conventional similarity measures. Additionally,
multimodal cues of utterances are effectively leveraged by SSLCL as data
augmentations to boost model performances. Extensive experiments on two ERC
benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate the compatibility and
superiority of our proposed SSLCL framework compared to existing
state-of-the-art SCL methods. Our code is available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Machine learning-based automatic scoring can be challenging if students&apos;
responses are unbalanced across scoring categories, as it introduces
uncertainty in the machine training process. To meet this challenge, we
introduce a novel text data augmentation framework using GPT-4, a generative
large language model, specifically tailored for unbalanced datasets in
automatic scoring. Our experimental dataset comprised student-written responses
to two science items. We crafted prompts for GPT-4 to generate responses
resembling student-written answers, particularly for the minority scoring
classes, to augment the data. We then finetuned DistillBERT for automatic
scoring based on the augmented and original datasets. Model performance was
assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We incorporate varied
amounts of augmented data to examine scoring performance, and our findings
revealed remarkedly improved model performance. The average maximum increase
observed across two items is: 3.5% for accuracy, 30.6% for precision, 21.1% for
recall, and 24.2% for F1 score. Notably, using just 5% of the augmented data
led to substantial improvements: 2.6%, 29.2%, 15.1%, and 19.6%. Interestingly,
the extent of improvement varied depending on specific datasets. Moreover, we
found that a varying amount of augmented data (5%-40%) was needed to obtain a
stable improvement. We also compare models trained with GPT-4 augmented data
and those trained with additional student-written responses. The findings
indicate that former ones match or even exceed the performance of the latter.
Specifically, there is an average difference of 1.7%, 1.9%, 11.0%, and 7.8% for
four metrics separately. This research underscores the potential and
effectiveness of data augmentation techniques utilizing GPT-4 in addressing
unbalanced datasets within automated assessment.

<title>Women Wearing Lipstick: Measuring the Bias Between an Object and Its Related Gender. (arXiv:2310.19130v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19130</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate the impact of objects on gender bias in image
captioning systems. Our results show that only gender-specific objects have a
strong gender bias (e.g., women-lipstick). In addition, we propose a visual
semantic-based gender score that measures the degree of bias and can be used as
a plug-in for any image captioning system. Our experiments demonstrate the
utility of the gender score, since we observe that our score can measure the
bias relation between a caption and its related gender; therefore, our score
can be used as an additional metric to the existing Object Gender Co-Occ
approach. Code and data are publicly available at

<title>Generating Medical Prescriptions with Conditional Transformer. (arXiv:2310.19727v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19727</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Access to real-world medication prescriptions is essential for medical
research and healthcare quality improvement. However, access to real medication
prescriptions is often limited due to the sensitive nature of the information
expressed. Additionally, manually labelling these instructions for training and
fine-tuning Natural Language Processing (NLP) models can be tedious and
expensive. We introduce a novel task-specific model architecture,
Label-To-Text-Transformer (\textbf{LT3}), tailored to generate synthetic
medication prescriptions based on provided labels, such as a vocabulary list of
medications and their attributes. LT3 is trained on a set of around 2K lines of
medication prescriptions extracted from the MIMIC-III database, allowing the
model to produce valuable synthetic medication prescriptions. We evaluate LT3&apos;s
performance by contrasting it with a state-of-the-art Pre-trained Language
Model (PLM), T5, analysing the quality and diversity of generated texts. We
deploy the generated synthetic data to train the SpacyNER model for the Named
Entity Recognition (NER) task over the n2c2-2018 dataset. The experiments show
that the model trained on synthetic data can achieve a 96-98\% F1 score at
Label Recognition on Drug, Frequency, Route, Strength, and Form. LT3 codes and
data will be shared at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown success in a diverse set
of language inference and understanding tasks. The pre-training stage of LLMs
looks at a large corpus of raw textual data. The BabyLM shared task compares

by 13-year-old kids is magnitudes smaller than the number of tokens seen by
LLMs. In this work, we pre-train and evaluate LLMs on their ability to learn
contextual word representations using roughly the same number of tokens as seen
by children. We provide a strong set of baselines; with different
architectures, evaluation of changes in performance across epochs, and reported
pre-training metrics for the strict small and strict tracks of the task. We
also try to loosely replicate the RoBERTa baseline given by the task organizers
to observe the training robustness to hyperparameter selection and
replicability. We provide the submission details to the strict and strict-small

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Documentation debt hinders the effective utilization of open-source software.
Although code summarization tools have been helpful for developers, most would
prefer a detailed account of each parameter in a function rather than a
high-level summary. However, generating such a summary is too intricate for a
single generative model to produce reliably due to the lack of high-quality
training data. Thus, we propose a multi-step approach that combines multiple
task-specific models, each adept at producing a specific section of a
docstring. The combination of these models ensures the inclusion of each
section in the final docstring. We compared the results from our approach with
existing generative models using both automatic metrics and a human-centred
evaluation with 17 participating developers, which proves the superiority of
our approach over existing methods.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07723</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;As AI systems become more intelligent and their behavior becomes more
challenging to assess, they may learn to game the flaws of human feedback
instead of genuinely striving to follow instructions; however, this risk can be
mitigated by controlling how LLMs generalize human feedback to situations where
it is unreliable. To better understand how reward models generalize, we craft
69 distribution shifts spanning 8 categories. We find that reward models do not
learn to evaluate `instruction-following&apos; by default and instead favor personas
that resemble internet text. Techniques for interpreting reward models&apos;
internal representations achieve better generalization than standard
fine-tuning, but still frequently fail to distinguish instruction-following
from conflated behaviors. We consolidate the 15 most challenging distribution
shifts into the GENeralization analogIES (GENIES) benchmark, which we hope will
enable progress toward controlling reward model generalization.

<title>In-context Learning and Gradient Descent Revisited. (arXiv:2311.07772v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07772</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In-context learning (ICL) has shown impressive results in few-shot learning
tasks, yet its underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Recent works
suggest that ICL can be thought of as a gradient descent (GD) based
optimization process. While promising, these results mainly focus on simplified
settings of ICL and provide only a preliminary evaluation of the similarities
between the two methods. In this work, we revisit the comparison between ICL
and GD-based finetuning and study what properties of ICL an equivalent process
must follow. We highlight a major difference in the flow of information between
ICL and standard finetuning. Namely, ICL can only rely on information from
lower layers at every point, while finetuning depends on loss gradients from
deeper layers. We refer to this discrepancy as Layer Causality and show that a
layer causal variant of the finetuning process aligns with ICL on par with
vanilla finetuning and is even better in most cases across relevant metrics. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to discuss this discrepancy
explicitly and suggest a solution that tackles this problem with minimal
changes.

<title>Language Generation from Human Brain Activities. (arXiv:2311.09889v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Generating human language through non-invasive brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) has the potential to unlock many applications, such as serving disabled
patients and improving communication. Currently, however, generating language
via BCIs has been previously successful only within a classification setup for
selecting pre-generated sentence continuation candidates with the most likely
cortical semantic representation. Inspired by recent research that revealed
associations between the brain and the large computational language models, we
propose a generative language BCI that utilizes the capacity of a large
language model (LLM) jointly with a semantic brain decoder to directly generate
language from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) input. The proposed
model can generate coherent language sequences aligned with the semantic
content of visual or auditory language stimuli perceived, without prior
knowledge of any pre-generated candidates. We compare the language generated
from the presented model with a random control, pre-generated language
selection approach, and a standard LLM, which generates common coherent text
solely based on the next word likelihood according to statistical language
training data. The proposed model is found to generate language that is more
aligned with semantic stimulus in response to which brain input is sampled. Our
findings demonstrate the potential and feasibility of employing BCIs in direct
language generation.

be non-integer values (typical for fractal sets), close to 9 for both of the
