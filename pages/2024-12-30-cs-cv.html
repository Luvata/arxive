<p><b>Authors:</b> Koichi Ito, Yihan Zhu, Mahmoud Abdelrahman, Xiucheng Liang, Zicheng Fan, Yujun Hou, Tianhong Zhao, Rui Ma, Kunihiko Fujiwara, Jiani Ouyang, Matias Quintana, Filip Biljecki</p>
<p>Abstract: Street view imagery (SVI) has been instrumental in many studies in the past decade to understand and characterize street features and the built environment. Researchers across a variety of domains, such as transportation, health, architecture, human perception, and infrastructure have employed different methods to analyze SVI. However, these applications and image-processing procedures have not been standardized, and solutions have been implemented in isolation, often making it difficult for others to reproduce existing work and carry out new research. Using SVI for research requires multiple technical steps: accessing APIs for scalable data collection, preprocessing images to standardize formats, implementing computer vision models for feature extraction, and conducting spatial analysis. These technical requirements create barriers for researchers in urban studies, particularly those without extensive programming experience. We develop ZenSVI, a free and open-source Python package that integrates and implements the entire process of SVI analysis, supporting a wide range of use cases. Its end-to-end pipeline includes downloading SVI from multiple platforms (e.g., Mapillary and KartaView) efficiently, analyzing metadata of SVI, applying computer vision models to extract target features, transforming SVI into different projections (e.g., fish-eye and perspective) and different formats (e.g., depth map and point cloud), visualizing analyses with maps and plots, and exporting outputs to other software tools. We demonstrate its use in Singapore through a case study of data quality assessment and clustering analysis in a streamlined manner. Our software improves the transparency, reproducibility, and scalability of research relying on SVI and supports researchers in conducting urban analyses efficiently. Its modular design facilitates extensions and unlocking new use cases.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18645">Dissecting CLIP: Decomposition with a Schur Complement-based Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Azim Ospanov, Mohammad Jalali, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the alignment of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the relevance of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which is responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the \textit{Schur Complement Entropy (SCE)} score, a measure of the intrinsic diversity of a text-to-image model based on data collected with varying text prompts. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt in the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of embeddings on specific objects or properties for downstream tasks. We present several numerical results that apply our Schur complement-based approach to evaluate text-to-image models and modify CLIP image embeddings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglin Yang, Celong Liu, Xueqing Deng, Dongwon Kim, Xing Mei, Xiaohui Shen, Liang-Chieh Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present 1.58-bit FLUX, the first successful approach to quantizing the state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model, FLUX.1-dev, using 1.58-bit weights (i.e., values in {-1, 0, +1}) while maintaining comparable performance for generating 1024 x 1024 images. Notably, our quantization method operates without access to image data, relying solely on self-supervision from the FLUX.1-dev model. Additionally, we develop a custom kernel optimized for 1.58-bit operations, achieving a 7.7x reduction in model storage, a 5.1x reduction in inference memory, and improved inference latency. Extensive evaluations on the GenEval and T2I Compbench benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of 1.58-bit FLUX in maintaining generation quality while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pooyan Rahmanzadehgrevi, Hung Huy Nguyen, Rosanne Liu, Long Mai, Anh Totti Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is a key component of Transformers, a widely popular architecture in both language and vision. Multiple heads intuitively enable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure the attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a novel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the traditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for interpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB constrains the total attention over all patches to $\in [0, 1]$. That is, when the total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the network and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic, image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs with TAB to perform image difference captioning. Over three datasets, our models perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is superior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is the first architecture to enable users to intervene by editing attention, which often produces expected outputs by VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faraz Waseem, Muhammad Shahzad</p>
<p>Abstract: An image may convey a thousand words, but a video composed of hundreds or thousands of image frames tells a more intricate story. Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended videos remains a formidable challenge. As of this writing, OpenAI's Sora, the current state-of-the-art system, is still limited to producing videos that are up to one minute in length. This limitation stems from the complexity of long video generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for approximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story development, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present additional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer approach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater control. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video generation, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models, video generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for evaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of the existing video generation capabilities. We believe it would serve as a comprehensive foundation, offering extensive information to guide future advancements and research in the field of long video generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present STITCH, a novel approach for neural implicit surface reconstruction of a sparse and irregularly spaced point cloud while enforcing topological constraints (such as having a single connected component). We develop a new differentiable framework based on persistent homology to formulate topological loss terms that enforce the prior of a single 2-manifold object. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in preserving the topology of complex 3D geometries, evident through both visual and empirical comparisons. We supplement this with a theoretical analysis, and provably show that optimizing the loss with stochastic (sub)gradient descent leads to convergence and enables reconstructing shapes with a single connected component. Our approach showcases the integration of differentiable topological data analysis tools for implicit surface reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxiao Cai, Dongting Hu, Ruoyan Yin, Jiankang Deng, Huan Fu, Wankou Yang, Mingming Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in various applications, where understanding uncertainty can enhance both safety and reliability. Despite this, the estimation and analysis of uncertainty in stereo matching have been largely overlooked. Previous works often provide limited interpretations of uncertainty and struggle to separate it effectively into data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) components. This disentanglement is essential, as it allows for a clearer understanding of the underlying sources of error, enhancing both prediction confidence and decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a new framework for stereo matching and its uncertainty quantification. We adopt Bayes risk as a measure of uncertainty and estimate data and model uncertainty separately. Experiments are conducted on four stereo benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our method can estimate uncertainty accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, we apply our uncertainty method to improve prediction accuracy by selecting data points with small uncertainties, which reflects the accuracy of our estimated uncertainty.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18718">Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Detection Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Nazeri, Chunheng Zhao, Pierluigi Pisu</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust object detection is critical for autonomous driving and mobile robotics, where accurate detection of vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles is essential for ensuring safety. Despite the advancements in object detection transformers (DETRs), their robustness against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of DETR model and its variants under both white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, using the MS-COCO and KITTI datasets to cover general and autonomous driving scenarios. We extend prominent white-box attack methods (FGSM, PGD, and CW) to assess DETR vulnerability, demonstrating that DETR models are significantly susceptible to adversarial attacks, similar to traditional CNN-based detectors. Our extensive transferability analysis reveals high intra-network transferability among DETR variants, but limited cross-network transferability to CNN-based models. Additionally, we propose a novel untargeted attack designed specifically for DETR, exploiting its intermediate loss functions to induce misclassification with minimal perturbations. Visualizations of self-attention feature maps provide insights into how adversarial attacks affect the internal representations of DETR models. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in detection transformers under standard adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for future research to enhance the robustness of transformer-based object detectors in safety-critical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Zhang, Shaoxuan Wu, Peilin Zhang, Zhuo Jin, Xiaosong Xiong, Qirong Bu, Jingkun Chen, Jun Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating fully annotated labels for medical image segmentation is prohibitively time-intensive and costly, emphasizing the necessity for innovative approaches that minimize reliance on detailed annotations. Scribble annotations offer a more cost-effective alternative, significantly reducing the expenses associated with full annotations. However, scribble annotations offer limited and imprecise information, failing to capture the detailed structural and boundary characteristics necessary for accurate organ delineation. To address these challenges, we propose HELPNet, a novel scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation framework, designed to bridge the gap between annotation efficiency and segmentation performance. HELPNet integrates three modules. The Hierarchical perturbations consistency (HPC) module enhances feature learning by employing density-controlled jigsaw perturbations across global, local, and focal views, enabling robust modeling of multi-scale structural representations. Building on this, the Entropy-guided pseudo-label (EGPL) module evaluates the confidence of segmentation predictions using entropy, generating high-quality pseudo-labels. Finally, the structural prior refinement (SPR) module incorporates connectivity and bounded priors to enhance the precision and reliability and pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three public datasets ACDC, MSCMRseg, and CHAOS show that HELPNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation and achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milton L. Montero, Jeffrey S. Bowers, Gaurav Malhotra</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, it has been shown empirically that standard disentangled latent variable models do not support robust compositional learning in the visual domain. Indeed, in spite of being designed with the goal of factorising datasets into their constituent factors of variations, disentangled models show extremely limited compositional generalisation capabilities. On the other hand, object-centric architectures have shown promising compositional skills, albeit these have 1) not been extensively tested and 2) experiments have been limited to scene composition -- where models must generalise to novel combinations of objects in a visual scene instead of novel combinations of object properties. In this work, we show that these compositional generalisation skills extend to this later setting. Furthermore, we present evidence pointing to the source of these skills and how they can be improved through careful training. Finally, we point to one important limitation that still exists which suggests new directions of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Liu, Xingyu Liu, Xiaohao Xu, Yixuan Zhang, Yongxin Ge, Lubin Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Group Re-identification (G-ReID) faces greater complexity than individual Re-identification (ReID) due to challenges like mutual occlusion, dynamic member interactions, and evolving group structures. Prior graph-based approaches have aimed to capture these dynamics by modeling the group as a single topological structure. However, these methods struggle to generalize across diverse group compositions, as they fail to fully represent the multifaceted relationships within the group.
  In this study, we introduce a Hierarchical Multi-Graphs Learning (HMGL) framework to address these challenges. Our approach models the group as a collection of multi-relational graphs, leveraging both explicit features (such as occlusion, appearance, and foreground information) and implicit dependencies between members. This hierarchical representation, encoded via a Multi-Graphs Neural Network (MGNN), allows us to resolve ambiguities in member relationships, particularly in complex, densely populated scenes. To further enhance matching accuracy, we propose a Multi-Scale Matching (MSM) algorithm, which mitigates issues of member information ambiguity and sensitivity to hard samples, improving robustness in challenging scenarios.
  Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks, CSG and RoadGroup, with Rank-1/mAP scores of 95.3%/94.4% and 93.9%/95.4%, respectively. These results mark notable improvements of 1.7% and 2.5% in Rank-1 accuracy over existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianbo Zhang, Chunyi Li, Liang Yuan, Guoquan Zheng, Jie Hao, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) of user-generated content (UGC) is a critical technique for human quality of experience (QoE). However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan Nguyen, Coy D. Heldermon, Corey Toler-Franklin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method that extends the self-attention mechanism of a vision transformer (ViT) for more accurate object detection across diverse datasets. ViTs show strong capability for image understanding tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and classification. This is due in part to their ability to leverage global information from interactions among visual tokens. However, the self-attention mechanism in ViTs are limited because they do not allow visual tokens to exchange local or global information with neighboring features before computing global attention. This is problematic because tokens are treated in isolation when attending (matching) to other tokens, and valuable spatial relationships are overlooked. This isolation is further compounded by dot-product similarity operations that make tokens from different semantic classes appear visually similar. To address these limitations, we introduce two modifications to the traditional self-attention framework; a novel aggressive convolution pooling strategy for local feature mixing, and a new conceptual attention transformation to facilitate interaction and feature exchange between semantic concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that local and global information exchange among visual features before self-attention significantly improves performance on challenging object detection tasks and generalizes across multiple benchmark datasets and challenging medical datasets. We publish source code and a novel dataset of cancerous tumors (chimeric cell clusters).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human skeleton-based action recognition has long been an indispensable aspect of artificial intelligence. Current state-of-the-art methods tend to consider only the dependencies between connected skeletal joints, limiting their ability to capture non-linear dependencies between physically distant joints. Moreover, most existing approaches distinguish action classes by estimating the probability density of motion representations, yet the high-dimensional nature of human motions invokes inherent difficulties in accomplishing such measurements. In this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from two directions: (1) We propose a novel dependency refinement approach that explicitly models dependencies between any pair of joints, effectively transcending the limitations imposed by joint distance. (2) We further propose a framework that utilizes the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion to differentiate action classes without being affected by data dimensionality, and mathematically derive learning objectives guaranteeing precise recognition. Empirically, our approach sets the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiao Gu, Mengtian Li, Ruhua Chen, Zhongxia Ji, Sichen Guo, Zhenye Zhang, Guangnan Ye, Zuo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: As demand from the film and gaming industries for 3D scenes with target styles grows, the importance of advanced 3D stylization techniques increases. However, recent methods often struggle to maintain local consistency in color and texture throughout stylized scenes, which is essential for maintaining aesthetic coherence. To solve this problem, this paper introduces ArtNVG, an innovative 3D stylization framework that efficiently generates stylized 3D scenes by leveraging reference style images. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), ArtNVG achieves rapid optimization and rendering while upholding high reconstruction quality. Our framework realizes high-quality 3D stylization by incorporating two pivotal techniques: Content-Style Separated Control and Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment. Content-Style Separated Control uses the CSGO model and the Tile ControlNet to decouple the content and style control, reducing risks of information leakage. Concurrently, Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment ensures consistency of local colors and textures across neighboring views, significantly improving visual quality. Extensive experiments validate that ArtNVG surpasses existing methods, delivering superior results in content preservation, style alignment, and local consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Buzhen Huang, Jingyi Ju, Yuan Shu, Yangang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic multi-person mesh recovery has broad applications in sports broadcasting, virtual reality, and video games. However, current multi-view frameworks rely on a time-consuming camera calibration procedure. In this work, we focus on multi-person motion capture with uncalibrated cameras, which mainly faces two challenges: one is that inter-person interactions and occlusions introduce inherent ambiguities for both camera calibration and motion capture; the other is that a lack of dense correspondences can be used to constrain sparse camera geometries in a dynamic multi-person scene. Our key idea is to incorporate motion prior knowledge to simultaneously estimate camera parameters and human meshes from noisy human semantics. We first utilize human information from 2D images to initialize intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Thus, the approach does not rely on any other calibration tools or background features. Then, a pose-geometry consistency is introduced to associate the detected humans from different views. Finally, a latent motion prior is proposed to refine the camera parameters and human motions. Experimental results show that accurate camera parameters and human motions can be obtained through a one-step reconstruction.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have shown immense potential for various image-related tasks. However, despite their prominence and popularity, customizing these models using unauthorized data also brings serious privacy and intellectual property issues. Existing methods introduce protective perturbations based on adversarial attacks, which are applied to the customization samples. In this systematization of knowledge, we present a comprehensive survey of protective perturbation methods designed to prevent unauthorized data usage in diffusion-based image generation. We establish the threat model and categorize the downstream tasks relevant to these methods, providing a detailed analysis of their designs. We also propose a completed evaluation framework for these perturbation techniques, aiming to advance research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enbo Huang, Yuan Zhang, Faliang Huang, Guangyu Zhang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Person image synthesis with controllable body poses and appearances is an essential task owing to the practical needs in the context of virtual try-on, image editing and video production. However, existing methods face significant challenges with details missing, limbs distortion and the garment style deviation. To address these issues, we propose a Disentangled Representations Diffusion Model (DRDM) to generate photo-realistic images from source portraits in specific desired poses and appearances. First, a pose encoder is responsible for encoding pose features into a high-dimensional space to guide the generation of person images. Second, a body-part subspace decoupling block (BSDB) disentangles features from the different body parts of a source figure and feeds them to the various layers of the noise prediction block, thereby supplying the network with rich disentangled features for generating a realistic target image. Moreover, during inference, we develop a parsing map-based disentangled classifier-free guided sampling method, which amplifies the conditional signals of texture and pose. Extensive experimental results on the Deepfashion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving pose transfer and appearance control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hila Levi, Guy Heller, Dan Levi</p>
<p>Abstract: As working with large datasets becomes standard, the task of accurately retrieving images containing objects of interest by an open set textual query gains practical importance. The current leading approach utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model without any adaptation to the target domain, balancing accuracy and efficiency through additional post-processing. In this work, we propose FOR: Finetuning for Object-centric Open-vocabulary Image Retrieval, which allows finetuning on a target dataset using closed-set labels while keeping the visual-language association crucial for open vocabulary retrieval. FOR is based on two design elements: a specialized decoder variant of the CLIP head customized for the intended task, and its coupling within a multi-objective training framework. Together, these design choices result in a significant increase in accuracy, showcasing improvements of up to 8 mAP@50 points over SoTA across three datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that FOR is also effective in a semi-supervised setting, achieving impressive results even when only a small portion of the dataset is labeled.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilei Jiang, Weihong Li, Yiyuan Zhang, Minghong Cai, Xiangyu Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: While Diffusion Models (DM) exhibit remarkable performance across various image generative tasks, they nonetheless reflect the inherent bias presented in the training set. As DMs are now widely used in real-world applications, these biases could perpetuate a distorted worldview and hinder opportunities for minority groups. Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model re-training with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers, which suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets causes expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily constrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional classifier. To address the above limitations, we propose DebiasDiff, a plug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a self-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference dataset. Specifically, DebiasDiff consists of two parts: a set of attribute adapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an attribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a self-discovering process. Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the set of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed distribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs simultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other DMs, eliminating the need for re-training. Extensive experiments on debiasing gender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method outperforms previous SOTA by a large margin.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pham Phuc, Son Vuong, Khang Nguyen, Tuan Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning-based object detection has become ubiquitous in the last decade due to its high accuracy in many real-world applications. With this growing trend, these models are interested in being attacked by adversaries, with most of the results being on classifiers, which do not match the context of practical object detection. In this work, we propose a novel method to fool object detectors, expose the vulnerability of state-of-the-art detectors, and promote later works to build more robust detectors to adversarial examples. Our method aims to generate adversarial images by perturbing object confidence scores during training, which is crucial in predicting confidence for each class in the testing phase. Herein, we provide a more intuitive technique to embed additive noises based on detected objects' masks and the training loss with distortion control over the original image by leveraging the gradient of iterative images. To verify the proposed method, we perform adversarial attacks against different object detectors, including the most recent state-of-the-art models like YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Swin Transformer. We also evaluate our technique on MS COCO 2017 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets and analyze the trade-off between success attack rate and image distortion. Our experiments show that the achievable success attack rate is up to $100$\% and up to $98$\% when performing white-box and black-box attacks, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pochuan Wang, Chen Shen, Masahiro Oda, Chiou-Shann Fuh, Kensaku Mori, Weichung Wang, Holger R. Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: In medical imaging, developing generalized segmentation models that can handle multiple organs and lesions is crucial. However, the scarcity of fully annotated datasets and strict privacy regulations present significant barriers to data sharing. Federated Learning (FL) allows decentralized model training, but existing FL methods often struggle with partial labeling, leading to model divergence and catastrophic forgetting. We propose ConDistFL, a novel FL framework incorporating conditional distillation to address these challenges. ConDistFL enables effective learning from partially labeled datasets, significantly improving segmentation accuracy across distributed and non-uniform datasets. In addition to its superior segmentation performance, ConDistFL maintains computational and communication efficiency, ensuring its scalability for real-world applications. Furthermore, ConDistFL demonstrates remarkable generalizability, significantly outperforming existing FL methods in out-of-federation tests, even adapting to unseen contrast phases (e.g., non-contrast CT images) in our experiments. Extensive evaluations on 3D CT and 2D chest X-ray datasets show that ConDistFL is an efficient, adaptable solution for collaborative medical image segmentation in privacy-constrained settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruohong Yang, Peng Hu, Xi Peng, Xiting Liu, Yunfan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained clustering is a practical yet challenging task, whose essence lies in capturing the subtle differences between instances of different classes. Such subtle differences can be easily disrupted by data augmentation or be overwhelmed by redundant information in data, leading to significant performance degradation for existing clustering methods. In this work, we introduce DiFiC a fine-grained clustering method building upon the conditional diffusion model. Distinct from existing works that focus on extracting discriminative features from images, DiFiC resorts to deducing the textual conditions used for image generation. To distill more precise and clustering-favorable object semantics, DiFiC further regularizes the diffusion target and guides the distillation process utilizing neighborhood similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiFiC outperforms both state-of-the-art discriminative and generative clustering methods on four fine-grained image clustering benchmarks. We hope the success of DiFiC will inspire future research to unlock the potential of diffusion models in tasks beyond generation. The code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng-Bo Fan, Ming-Kun Xie, Jia-Hao Xiao, Sheng-Jun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the lack of extensive precisely-annotated multi-label data in real word, semi-supervised multi-label learning (SSMLL) has gradually gained attention. Abundant knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs could alleviate the challenge of limited labeled data under SSMLL setting.Despite existing methods based on fine-tuning VLMs have achieved advances in weakly-supervised multi-label learning, they failed to fully leverage the information from labeled data to enhance the learning of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a context-based semantic-aware alignment method to solve the SSMLL problem by leveraging the knowledge of VLMs. To address the challenge of handling multiple semantics within an image, we introduce a novel framework design to extract label-specific image features. This design allows us to achieve a more compact alignment between text features and label-specific image features, leading the model to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. To incorporate the model with comprehensive understanding of image, we design a semi-supervised context identification auxiliary task to enhance the feature representation by capturing co-occurrence information. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxence Boels, Yang Liu, Prokar Dasgupta, Alejandro Granados, Sebastien Ourselin</p>
<p>Abstract: While existing recognition approaches excel at identifying current surgical phases, they provide limited foresight into future procedural steps, restricting their intraoperative utility. Similarly, current anticipation methods are constrained to predicting short-term events or singular future occurrences, neglecting the dynamic and sequential nature of surgical workflows. To address these limitations, we propose SWAG (Surgical Workflow Anticipative Generation), a unified framework for phase recognition and long-term anticipation of surgical workflows. SWAG employs two generative decoding methods -- single-pass (SP) and auto-regressive (AR) -- to predict sequences of future surgical phases. A novel prior knowledge embedding mechanism enhances the accuracy of anticipatory predictions. The framework addresses future phase classification and remaining time regression tasks. Additionally, a regression-to-classification (R2C) method is introduced to map continuous predictions to discrete temporal segments. SWAG's performance was evaluated on the Cholec80 and AutoLaparo21 datasets. The single-pass classification model with prior knowledge embeddings (SWAG-SP\*) achieved 53.5\% accuracy in 15-minute anticipation on AutoLaparo21, while the R2C model reached 60.8\% accuracy on Cholec80. SWAG's single-pass regression approach outperformed existing methods for remaining time prediction, achieving weighted mean absolute errors of 0.32 and 0.48 minutes for 2- and 3-minute horizons, respectively. SWAG demonstrates versatility across classification and regression tasks, offering robust tools for real-time surgical workflow anticipation. By unifying recognition and anticipatory capabilities, SWAG provides actionable predictions to enhance intraoperative decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Wu, Panwang Xia, Lei Yu, Yi Liu, Mingtao Xiong, Liheng Zhong, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang, Yongjun Zhang, Yi Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) has been widely applied in fields such as robotic navigation and augmented reality. Existing approaches primarily use single images or fixed-view image sequences as queries, which limits perspective diversity. In contrast, when humans determine their location visually, they typically move around to gather multiple perspectives. This behavior suggests that integrating diverse visual cues can improve geo-localization reliability. Therefore, we propose a novel task: Cross-View Image Set Geo-Localization (Set-CVGL), which gathers multiple images with diverse perspectives as a query set for localization. To support this task, we introduce SetVL-480K, a benchmark comprising 480,000 ground images captured worldwide and their corresponding satellite images, with each satellite image corresponds to an average of 40 ground images from varied perspectives and locations. Furthermore, we propose FlexGeo, a flexible method designed for Set-CVGL that can also adapt to single-image and image-sequence inputs. FlexGeo includes two key modules: the Similarity-guided Feature Fuser (SFF), which adaptively fuses image features without prior content dependency, and the Individual-level Attributes Learner (IAL), leveraging geo-attributes of each image for comprehensive scene perception. FlexGeo consistently outperforms existing methods on SetVL-480K and two public datasets, SeqGeo and KITTI-CVL, achieving a localization accuracy improvement of over 22% on SetVL-480K.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shoma Kudo, Satoshi Kagiwada, Hitoshi Iyatomi</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous studies have explored image-based automated systems for plant disease diagnosis, demonstrating impressive diagnostic capabilities. However, recent large-scale analyses have revealed a critical limitation: that the diagnostic capability suffers significantly when validated on images captured in environments (domains) differing from those used during training. This shortfall stems from the inherently limited dataset size and the diverse manifestation of disease symptoms, combined with substantial variations in cultivation environments and imaging conditions, such as equipment and composition. These factors lead to insufficient variety in training data, ultimately constraining the system's robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Few-shot Metric Domain Adaptation (FMDA), a flexible and effective approach for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in practical systems, even when only limited target data is available. FMDA reduces domain discrepancies by introducing a constraint to the diagnostic model that minimizes the "distance" between feature spaces of source (training) data and target data with limited samples. FMDA is computationally efficient, requiring only basic feature distance calculations and backpropagation, and can be seamlessly integrated into any machine learning (ML) pipeline. In large-scale experiments, involving 223,015 leaf images across 20 fields and 3 crop species, FMDA achieved F1 score improvements of 11.1 to 29.3 points compared to cases without target data, using only 10 images per disease from the target domain. Moreover, FMDA consistently outperformed fine-tuning methods utilizing the same data, with an average improvement of 8.5 points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghao Qian, Yuhu Guo, Wenjing Li, Gustav Markkula</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Lei, Meiying Zhang, Weiyuan Peng, Qi Hao, Chengzhong Xu, Chunlin Ji, Guang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Most autonomous driving (AD) datasets incur substantial costs for collection and labeling, inevitably yielding a plethora of low-quality and redundant data instances, thereby compromising performance and efficiency. Many applications in AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing datasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene joint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the balanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled data. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme based on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object classes, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a similarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation and a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an uncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select instances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner. Finally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy yields an optimal and valuable subdataset. Experiments on the KITTI, Lyft, nuScenes and SUScape datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 3D object detection tasks with up to 12% improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Due to the density inconsistency and distribution difference between cross-source point clouds, previous methods fail in cross-source point cloud registration. We propose a density-robust feature extraction and matching scheme to achieve robust and accurate cross-source registration. To address the density inconsistency between cross-source data, we introduce a density-robust encoder for extracting density-robust features. To tackle the issue of challenging feature matching and few correct correspondences, we adopt a loose-to-strict matching pipeline with a ``loose generation, strict selection'' idea. Under it, we employ a one-to-many strategy to loosely generate initial correspondences. Subsequently, high-quality correspondences are strictly selected to achieve robust registration through sparse matching and dense matching. On the challenging Kinect-LiDAR scene in the cross-source 3DCSR dataset, our method improves feature matching recall by 63.5 percentage points (pp) and registration recall by 57.6 pp. It also achieves the best performance on 3DMatch, while maintaining robustness under diverse downsampling densities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reyhaneh Hosseininejad, Megh Shukla, Saeed Saadatnejad, Mathieu Salzmann, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: Human pose forecasting is inherently multimodal since multiple futures exist for an observed pose sequence. However, evaluating multimodality is challenging since the task is ill-posed. Therefore, we first propose an alternative paradigm to make the task well-posed. Next, while state-of-the-art methods predict multimodality, this requires oversampling a large volume of predictions. This raises key questions: (1) Can we capture multimodality by efficiently sampling a smaller number of predictions? (2) Subsequently, which of the predicted futures is more likely for an observed pose sequence? We address these questions with MotionMap, a simple yet effective heatmap based representation for multimodality. We extend heatmaps to represent a spatial distribution over the space of all possible motions, where different local maxima correspond to different forecasts for a given observation. MotionMap can capture a variable number of modes per observation and provide confidence measures for different modes. Further, MotionMap allows us to introduce the notion of uncertainty and controllability over the forecasted pose sequence. Finally, MotionMap captures rare modes that are non-trivial to evaluate yet critical for safety. We support our claims through multiple qualitative and quantitative experiments using popular 3D human pose datasets: Human3.6M and AMASS, highlighting the strengths and limitations of our proposed method.

<p>Abstract: The application of vision-based multi-view environmental perception system has been increasingly recognized in autonomous driving technology, especially the BEV-based models. Current state-of-the-art solutions primarily encode image features from each camera view into the BEV space through explicit or implicit depth prediction. However, these methods often focus on improving the accuracy of projecting 2D features into corresponding depth regions, while overlooking the highly structured information of real-world objects and the varying height distributions of objects across different scenes. In this work, we propose HV-BEV, a novel approach that decouples feature sampling in the BEV grid queries paradigm into horizontal feature aggregation and vertical adaptive height-aware reference point sampling, aiming to improve both the aggregation of objects' complete information and generalization to diverse road environments. Specifically, we construct a learnable graph structure in the horizontal plane aligned with the ground for 3D reference points, reinforcing the association of the same instance across different BEV grids, especially when the instance spans multiple image views around the vehicle. Additionally, instead of relying on uniform sampling within a fixed height range, we introduce a height-aware module that incorporates historical information, enabling the reference points to adaptively focus on the varying heights at which objects appear in different scenes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its superior performance over the baseline across the nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our best-performing model achieves a remarkable 50.5% mAP and 59.8% NDS on the nuScenes testing set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Chia Chen, Wei-Hua Li, Chu-Song Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation remains a challenging problem. One of the biggest difficulties lies in training models to generalize to an unlimited number of classes using limited categorized training data. Recent popular methods involve large-scale vision-language pre-trained foundation models, such as CLIP. In this paper, we propose OMTSeg for open-vocabulary segmentation using another large-scale vision-language pre-trained model called BEiT-3 and leveraging the cross-modal attention between visual and linguistic features in BEiT-3 to achieve better performance. Experiments result demonstrates that OMTSeg performs favorably against state-of-the-art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjoeng Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic prohibited item detection in X-ray images is crucial for public safety. However, most existing detection methods either rely on expensive box annotations to achieve high performance or use weak annotations but suffer from limited accuracy. To balance annotation cost and detection performance, we study Weakly Semi-Supervised X-ray Prohibited Item Detection with Points (WSSPID-P) and propose a novel \textbf{B}oundary-\textbf{C}ategory \textbf{R}efinement \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{BCR-Net}) that requires only a few box annotations and a large number of point annotations. BCR-Net is built based on Group R-CNN and introduces a new Boundary Refinement (BR) module and a new Category Refinement (CR) module. The BR module develops a dual attention mechanism to focus on both the boundaries and salient features of prohibited items. Meanwhile, the CR module incorporates contrastive branches into the heads of RPN and ROI by introducing a scale- and rotation-aware contrastive loss, enhancing intra-class consistency and inter-class separability in the feature space. Based on the above designs, BCR-Net effectively addresses the closely related problems of imprecise localization and inaccurate classification. Experimental results on public X-ray datasets show the effectiveness of BCR-Net, achieving significant performance improvements to state-of-the-art methods under limited annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingchen Wei, Xihe Qiu, Xiaoyu Tan, Jingjing Huang, Wei Chu, Yinghui Xu, Yuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a common sleep disorder caused by upper airway blockage, leading to oxygen deprivation and disrupted sleep. Traditional diagnosis using polysomnography (PSG) is expensive, time-consuming, and uncomfortable. Existing deep learning methods using facial image analysis lack accuracy due to poor facial feature capture and limited sample sizes. To address this, we propose a multimodal dual encoder model that integrates visual and language inputs for automated OSAHS diagnosis. The model balances data using randomOverSampler, extracts key facial features with attention grids, and converts physiological data into meaningful text. Cross-attention combines image and text data for better feature extraction, and ordered regression loss ensures stable learning. Our approach improves diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, achieving 91.3% top-1 accuracy in a four-class severity classification task, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, single-view 3D face reconstruction methods can produce beautiful 3D models. Nevertheless,the input of these works is unobstructed faces.We describe a system designed to reconstruct convincing face texture in the case of occlusion.Motivated by parsing facial features,we propose a complete face parsing map generation method guided by landmarks.We estimate the 2D face structure of the reasonable position of the occlusion area,which is used for the construction of 3D texture.An excellent anti-occlusion face reconstruction method should ensure the authenticity of the output,including the topological structure between the eyes,nose, and mouth. We extensively tested our method and its components, qualitatively demonstrating the rationality of our estimated facial structure. We conduct extensive experiments on general 3D face reconstruction tasks as concrete examples to demonstrate the method's superior regulation ability over existing methods often break down.We further provide numerous quantitative examples showing that our method advances both the quality and the robustness of 3D face reconstruction under occlusion scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunhao Duan, Shanshan Zhao, Wenjun Yan, Yinglun Li, Qing-Guo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Mingming Gong, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable advancements, particularly with diffusion models facilitating high-quality image synthesis from textual descriptions. However, these models often struggle with achieving precise control over pixel-level layouts, object appearances, and global styles when using text prompts alone. To mitigate this issue, previous works introduce conditional images as auxiliary inputs for image generation, enhancing control but typically necessitating specialized models tailored to different types of reference inputs. In this paper, we explore a new approach to unify controllable generation within a single framework. Specifically, we propose the unified image-instruction adapter (UNIC-Adapter) built on the Multi-Modal-Diffusion Transformer architecture, to enable flexible and controllable generation across diverse conditions without the need for multiple specialized models. Our UNIC-Adapter effectively extracts multi-modal instruction information by incorporating both conditional images and task instructions, injecting this information into the image generation process through a cross-attention mechanism enhanced by Rotary Position Embedding. Experimental results across a variety of tasks, including pixel-level spatial control, subject-driven image generation, and style-image-based image synthesis, demonstrate the effectiveness of our UNIC-Adapter in unified controllable image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> W. He, Z. Huang, X. Meng, X. Qi, R. Xiao, C. -G. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of pre-trained models, image clustering task is usually addressed by two relevant stages: a) to produce features from pre-trained vision models; and b) to find clusters from the pre-trained features. However, these two stages are often considered separately or learned by different paradigms, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, termed graph Cut-guided Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (CgMCR$^2$), for jointly learning the structured embeddings and the clustering. To be specific, we attempt to integrate an efficient clustering module into the principled framework for learning structured representation, in which the clustering module is used to provide partition information to guide the cluster-wise compression and the learned embeddings is aligned to desired geometric structures in turn to help for yielding more accurate partitions. We conduct extensive experiments on both standard and out-of-domain image datasets and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiao Li, Xiaoyuan Yang, Weide Liu, Xin Jin, Xu Jia, Yukun Lai, Haotao Liu, Paul L Rosin, Wei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) has been actively researched for user-generated content (UGC) videos. Recently, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely applied in UGC. Therefore, an effective BVQA method for both UGC and SR scenarios is essential. Temporal inconsistency, referring to irregularities between consecutive frames, is relevant to video quality. Current BVQA approaches typically model temporal relationships in UGC videos using statistics of motion information, but inconsistencies remain unexplored. Additionally, different from temporal inconsistency in UGC videos, such inconsistency in SR videos is amplified due to upscaling algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment (TINQ) metric, demonstrating that exploring temporal inconsistency is crucial for effective BVQA. Since temporal inconsistencies vary between UGC and SR videos, they are calculated in different ways. Based on this, a spatial module highlights inconsistent areas across consecutive frames at coarse and fine granularities. In addition, a temporal module aggregates features over time in two stages. The first stage employs a visual memory capacity block to adaptively segment the time dimension based on estimated complexity, while the second stage focuses on selecting key features. The stages work together through Consistency-aware Fusion Units to regress cross-time-scale video quality. Extensive experiments on UGC and SR video quality datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art BVQA methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Lighting-YXLI/TINQ.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945">Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijie Xu, Runqi Wang, Wei Zhu, Dejia Song, Nemo Chen, Xu Tang, Yao Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammet Esat Kalfaoglu, Halil Ibrahim Ozturk, Ozsel Kilinc, Alptekin Temizel</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding road topology is crucial for autonomous driving. This paper introduces TopoBDA (Topology with Bezier Deformable Attention), a novel approach that enhances road topology understanding by leveraging Bezier Deformable Attention (BDA). BDA utilizes Bezier control points to drive the deformable attention mechanism, significantly improving the detection and representation of elongated and thin polyline structures, such as lane centerlines. TopoBDA processes multi-camera 360-degree imagery to generate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features, which are refined through a transformer decoder employing BDA. This method enhances computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy in centerline prediction. Additionally, TopoBDA incorporates an instance mask formulation and an auxiliary one-to-many set prediction loss strategy to further refine centerline detection and improve road topology understanding. Experimental evaluations on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that TopoBDA outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in centerline detection and topology reasoning. The integration of multi-modal data, including lidar and radar, specifically for road topology understanding, further enhances the model's performance, underscoring its importance in autonomous driving applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhefan Rao, Liya Ji, Yazhou Xing, Runtao Liu, Zhaoyang Liu, Jiaxin Xie, Ziqiao Peng, Yingqing He, Qifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has gained significant attention recently. However, the costs of training a T2V model from scratch remain persistently high, and there is considerable room for improving the generation performance, especially under limited computation resources. This work explores the continual general pre-training of text-to-video models, enabling the model to "grow" its abilities based on a pre-trained foundation, analogous to how humans acquire new knowledge based on past experiences. There is a lack of extensive study of the continual pre-training techniques in T2V generation. In this work, we take the initial step toward exploring this task systematically and propose ModelGrow. Specifically, we break this task into two key aspects: increasing model capacity and improving semantic understanding. For model capacity, we introduce several novel techniques to expand the model size, enabling it to store new knowledge and improve generation performance. For semantic understanding, we propose a method that leverages large language models as advanced text encoders, integrating them into T2V models to enhance language comprehension and guide generation results according to detailed prompts. This approach enables the model to achieve better semantic alignment, particularly in response to complex user prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various metrics. The source code and the model of ModelGrow will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Zhang, Qing Zhang, Jiayun Wu, Youwei Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is designed to identify objects that blend seamlessly with their surroundings. Due to the complexity of camouflaged objects (such as shape, color, and texture), their semantic cues are often blurred or completely lost, posing a significant challenge for COD. Existing COD methods often rely on visual features, which are not stable enough in changeable camouflage environments. This instability leads to false positives and false negatives, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate segmentation results. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a new task, Class-Guided Camouflaged Object Detection (CG-COD), which extends the traditional COD task by introducing object class knowledge, significantly improving the robustness and segmentation accuracy of the model in complex environments. Toward this end, we construct a dataset, CamoClass, containing the camouflaged objects in the real scenes and their corresponding class annotation. Based on this, we propose a multi-stage framework CGNet which consists of a plug-and-play class prompt generator and a class-guided detector. Under the guidance of textual information, CGNet enables efficient segmentation. It is worth emphasizing that for the first time, we extend the object class annotations on existing COD benchmark datasets, and introduce a flexible framework to improve the performance of the existing COD model under text guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Hamdan, Abderrahmane Rahiche, Mohamed Cheriet</p>
<p>Abstract: Handwritten document recognition (HDR) is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision, due to the various writing styles and complex layouts inherent in handwritten texts. Traditionally, this problem has been approached as two separate tasks, handwritten text recognition and layout analysis, and struggled to integrate the two processes effectively. This paper introduces HAND (Hierarchical Attention Network for Multi-Scale Document), a novel end-to-end and segmentation-free architecture for simultaneous text recognition and layout analysis tasks. Our model's key components include an advanced convolutional encoder integrating Gated Depth-wise Separable and Octave Convolutions for robust feature extraction, a Multi-Scale Adaptive Processing (MSAP) framework that dynamically adjusts to document complexity and a hierarchical attention decoder with memory-augmented and sparse attention mechanisms. These components enable our model to scale effectively from single-line to triple-column pages while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, HAND adopts curriculum learning across five complexity levels. To improve the recognition accuracy of complex ancient manuscripts, we fine-tune and integrate a Domain-Adaptive Pre-trained mT5 model for post-processing refinement. Extensive evaluations on the READ 2016 dataset demonstrate the superior performance of HAND, achieving up to 59.8% reduction in CER for line-level recognition and 31.2% for page-level recognition compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model also maintains a compact size of 5.60M parameters while establishing new benchmarks in both text recognition and layout analysis.

<p>Abstract: This paper expands the cascaded network branch of the autoencoder-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework for dynamic facial expression recognition, namely Multi-Task Cascaded Autoencoder for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (MTCAE-DFER). MTCAE-DFER builds a plug-and-play cascaded decoder module, which is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and employs the decoder concept of Transformer to reconstruct the multi-head attention module. The decoder output from the previous task serves as the query (Q), representing local dynamic features, while the Video Masked Autoencoder (VideoMAE) shared encoder output acts as both the key (K) and value (V), representing global dynamic features. This setup facilitates interaction between global and local dynamic features across related tasks. Additionally, this proposal aims to alleviate overfitting of complex large model. We utilize autoencoder-based multi-task cascaded learning approach to explore the impact of dynamic face detection and dynamic face landmark on dynamic facial expression recognition, which enhances the model's generalization ability. After we conduct extensive ablation experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on various public datasets for dynamic facial expression recognition, the robustness of the MTCAE-DFER model and the effectiveness of global-local dynamic feature interaction among related tasks have been proven.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the integration of Lidar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and optical imagery through advanced artificial intelligence techniques for enhanced urban mapping. By fusing these diverse geospatial datasets, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with single-sensor data, achieving a more comprehensive representation of urban environments. The research employs Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) as the primary deep learning model for urban feature extraction, enabling precise pixel-wise classification of essential urban elements, including buildings, roads, and vegetation. To optimize the performance of the FCN model, we utilize Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning, significantly enhancing model accuracy. Key findings indicate that the FCN-PSO model achieved a pixel accuracy of 92.3% and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 87.6%, surpassing traditional single-sensor approaches. These results underscore the potential of fused geospatial data and AI-driven methodologies in urban mapping, providing valuable insights for urban planning and management.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theresa Chen, Yao-Yi Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate change poses an extreme threat to biodiversity, making it imperative to efficiently model the geographical range of different species. The availability of large-scale remote sensing images and environmental data has facilitated the use of machine learning in Species Distribution Models (SDMs), which aim to predict the presence of a species at any given location. Traditional SDMs, reliant on expert observation, are labor-intensive, but advancements in remote sensing and citizen science data have facilitated machine learning approaches to SDM development. However, these models often struggle with leveraging spatial relationships between different inputs -- for instance, learning how climate data should inform the data present in satellite imagery -- without upsampling or distorting the original inputs. Additionally, location information and ecological characteristics at a location play a crucial role in predicting species distribution models, but these aspects have not yet been incorporated into state-of-the-art approaches. In this work, we introduce MiTREE: a multi-input Vision-Transformer-based model with an ecoregion encoder. MiTREE computes spatial cross-modal relationships without upsampling as well as integrates location and ecological context. We evaluate our model on the SatBird Summer and Winter datasets, the goal of which is to predict bird species encounter rates, and we find that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image inpainting is a widely used technique in computer vision for reconstructing missing or damaged pixels in images. Recent advancements with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated superior performance over traditional methods due to their deep learning capabilities and adaptability across diverse image domains. Residual Networks (ResNet) have also gained prominence for their ability to enhance feature representation and compatibility with other architectures. This paper introduces a novel architecture combining GAN and ResNet models to improve image inpainting outcomes. Our framework integrates three components: Transpose Convolution-based GAN for guided and blind inpainting, Fast ResNet-Convolutional Neural Network (FR-CNN) for object removal, and Co-Modulation GAN (Co-Mod GAN) for refinement. The model's performance was evaluated on benchmark datasets, achieving accuracies of 96.59% on Image-Net, 96.70% on Places2, and 96.16% on CelebA. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanglong Lu, Jikai Wang, Xiaogang Jin, Xianta Jiang, Hanli Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing facial editing methods have achieved remarkable results, yet they often fall short in supporting multimodal conditional local facial editing. One of the significant evidences is that their output image quality degrades dramatically after several iterations of incremental editing, as they do not support local editing. In this paper, we present a novel multimodal generative and fusion framework for globally-consistent local facial editing (FACEMUG) that can handle a wide range of input modalities and enable fine-grained and semantic manipulation while remaining unedited parts unchanged. Different modalities, including sketches, semantic maps, color maps, exemplar images, text, and attribute labels, are adept at conveying diverse conditioning details, and their combined synergy can provide more explicit guidance for the editing process. We thus integrate all modalities into a unified generative latent space to enable multimodal local facial edits. Specifically, a novel multimodal feature fusion mechanism is proposed by utilizing multimodal aggregation and style fusion blocks to fuse facial priors and multimodalities in both latent and feature spaces. We further introduce a novel self-supervised latent warping algorithm to rectify misaligned facial features, efficiently transferring the pose of the edited image to the given latent codes. We evaluate our FACEMUG through extensive experiments and comparisons to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of FACEMUG in terms of editing quality, flexibility, and semantic control, making it a promising solution for a wide range of local facial editing tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks on point clouds are crucial for assessing and improving the adversarial robustness of 3D deep learning models. Traditional solutions strictly limit point displacement during attacks, making it challenging to balance imperceptibility with adversarial effectiveness. In this paper, we attribute the inadequate imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on point clouds to deviations from the underlying surface. To address this, we introduce a novel point-to-surface (P2S) field that adjusts adversarial perturbation directions by dragging points back to their original underlying surface. Specifically, we use a denoising network to learn the gradient field of the logarithmic density function encoding the shape's surface, and apply a distance-aware adjustment to perturbation directions during attacks, thereby enhancing imperceptibility. Extensive experiments show that adversarial attacks guided by our P2S field are more imperceptible, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p>

However, existing OV-SGG methods are constrained by fixed text representations, limiting diversity and accuracy in image-text alignment. To address these challenges, we propose the Relation-Aware Hierarchical Prompting (RAHP) framework, which enhances text representation by integrating subject-object and region-specific relation information. Our approach utilizes entity clustering to address the complexity of relation triplet categories, enabling the effective integration of subject-object information. Additionally, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate detailed region-aware prompts, capturing fine-grained visual interactions and improving alignment between visual and textual modalities. RAHP also introduces a dynamic selection mechanism within Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which adaptively selects relevant text prompts based on the visual content, reducing noise from irrelevant prompts. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of open-vocabulary scene graph generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiyuan Tian, Bonan Xu, Shijian Li, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation effectively reduces model complexity while improving performance, yet the underlying knowledge transfer mechanisms remain poorly understood. We propose novel spectral analysis methods and guidelines to optimize distillation, making the knowledge transfer process more interpretable. Our analysis reveals that CaiT models concentrate information in their first and last few layers, informing optimal layer selection for feature map distillation. Surprisingly, we discover that Swin Transformer and CaiT exhibit similar spectral encoding patterns despite their architectural differences, enhancing our understanding of transformer architectures and leading to improved feature map alignment strategies. Based on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective spectral alignment method named SpectralKD. Experimental results demonstrate that following our guidelines enables SpectralKD to achieve state-of-the-art performance (DeiT-Tiny: $+5.2\%$, Swin-Tiny: $+1.4\%$ in ImageNet-1k Top-1 accuracy). Furthermore, through spectral analysis of student models trained with and without distillation, we show that distilled models mirror spectral patterns of their teachers, providing a new lens for interpreting knowledge distillation dynamics. Our code, pre-trained models, and experimental logs will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19062">DAPoinTr: Domain Adaptive Point Transformer for Point Cloud Completion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghui Li, Qianyu Zhou, Jingyu Gong, Ye Zhu, Richard Dazeley, Xinkui Zhao, Xuequan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Point Transformers (PoinTr) have shown great potential in point cloud completion recently. Nevertheless, effective domain adaptation that improves transferability toward target domains remains unexplored. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically discover that direct feature alignment on point Transformer's CNN backbone only brings limited improvements since it cannot guarantee sequence-wise domain-invariant features in the Transformer. To this end, we propose a pioneering Domain Adaptive Point Transformer (DAPoinTr) framework for point cloud completion. DAPoinTr consists of three key components: Domain Query-based Feature Alignment (DQFA), Point Token-wise Feature alignment (PTFA), and Voted Prediction Consistency (VPC). In particular, DQFA is presented to narrow the global domain gaps from the sequence via the presented domain proxy and domain query at the Transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. PTFA is proposed to close the local domain shifts by aligning the tokens, \emph{i.e.,} point proxy and dynamic query, at the Transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. VPC is designed to consider different Transformer decoders as multiple of experts (MoE) for ensembled prediction voting and pseudo-label generation. Extensive experiments with visualization on several domain adaptation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our DAPoinTr compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitao Meng, Chonghao Zhong, Sheng Tang, Lian JunJia, Wenwei Lin, Zhenshan Bing, Yi Chang, Gang Chen, Alois Knoll</p>
<p>Abstract: Event cameras are neuromorphically inspired sensors that sparsely and asynchronously report brightness changes. Their unique characteristics of high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption make them well-suited for addressing challenges in monocular depth estimation (e.g., high-speed or low-lighting conditions). However, current existing methods primarily treat event streams as black-box learning systems without incorporating prior physical principles, thus becoming over-parameterized and failing to fully exploit the rich temporal information inherent in event camera data. To address this limitation, we incorporate physical motion principles to propose an interpretable monocular depth estimation framework, where the likelihood of various depth hypotheses is explicitly determined by the effect of motion compensation. To achieve this, we propose a Focus Cost Discrimination (FCD) module that measures the clarity of edges as an essential indicator of focus level and integrates spatial surroundings to facilitate cost estimation. Furthermore, we analyze the noise patterns within our framework and improve it with the newly introduced Inter-Hypotheses Cost Aggregation (IHCA) module, where the cost volume is refined through cost trend prediction and multi-scale cost consistency constraints. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms cutting-edge methods by up to 10\% in terms of the absolute relative error metric, revealing superior performance in predicting accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Qian, YD Chen, Shengtao Lou, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Xiaogang Jin, Deng-Ping Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Dichotomous Image Segmentation (DIS) tasks require highly precise annotations, and traditional dataset creation methods are labor intensive, costly, and require extensive domain expertise. Although using synthetic data for DIS is a promising solution to these challenges, current generative models and techniques struggle with the issues of scene deviations, noise-induced errors, and limited training sample variability. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach, \textbf{\ourmodel{}}, which provides a scalable solution for generating diverse and precise datasets, markedly reducing preparation time and costs. We first introduce a general mask editing method that combines rigid and non-rigid editing techniques to generate high-quality synthetic masks. Specially, rigid editing leverages geometric priors from diffusion models to achieve precise viewpoint transformations under zero-shot conditions, while non-rigid editing employs adversarial training and self-attention mechanisms for complex, topologically consistent modifications. Then, we generate pairs of high-resolution image and accurate segmentation mask using a multi-conditional control generation method. Finally, our experiments on the widely-used DIS5K dataset benchmark demonstrate superior performance in quality and efficiency compared to existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Shuai Fu, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Soft prompt learning methods are effective for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Nevertheless, empirical evidence reveals a tendency of existing methods that they overfit seen classes and exhibit degraded performance on unseen classes. This limitation is due to the inherent bias in the training data towards the seen classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel soft prompt learning method, named Mixture-of-Prompts Distillation (MoPD), which can effectively transfer useful knowledge from hard prompts manually hand-crafted (a.k.a. teacher prompts) to the learnable soft prompt (a.k.a. student prompt), thereby enhancing the generalization ability of soft prompts on unseen classes. Moreover, the proposed MoPD method utilizes a gating network that learns to select hard prompts used for prompt distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoPD method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines especially on on unseen classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changwoon Choi (Seoul National University), Jeongjun Kim (Seoul National University), Geonho Cha (NAVER Cloud), Minkwan Kim (Seoul National University), Dongyoon Wee (NAVER Cloud), Young Min Kim (Seoul National University)</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works on dynamic neural field reconstruction assume input from synchronized multi-view videos with known poses. These input constraints are often unmet in real-world setups, making the approach impractical. We demonstrate that unsynchronized videos with unknown poses can generate dynamic neural fields if the videos capture human motion. Humans are one of the most common dynamic subjects whose poses can be estimated using state-of-the-art methods. While noisy, the estimated human shape and pose parameters provide a decent initialization for the highly non-convex and under-constrained problem of training a consistent dynamic neural representation. Given the sequences of pose and shape of humans, we estimate the time offsets between videos, followed by camera pose estimations by analyzing 3D joint locations. Then, we train dynamic NeRF employing multiresolution rids while simultaneously refining both time offsets and camera poses. The setup still involves optimizing many parameters, therefore, we introduce a robust progressive learning strategy to stabilize the process. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate spatiotemporal calibration and high-quality scene reconstruction in challenging conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Cabral, Maria De Iorio, Andrew Harris</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work we investigate the application of advanced object detection techniques to digital numismatics, focussing on the analysis of historical coins. Leveraging models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), we develop a flexible framework for identifying and classifying specific coin features using both image and textual descriptions. By examining two distinct datasets, modern Russian coins featuring intricate "Saint George and the Dragon" designs and degraded 1st millennium AD Southeast Asian coins bearing Hindu-Buddhist symbols, we evaluate the efficacy of different detection algorithms in search and classification tasks. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of larger CLIP models in detecting complex imagery, while traditional methods excel in identifying simple geometric patterns. Additionally, we propose a statistical calibration mechanism to enhance the reliability of similarity scores in low-quality datasets. This work highlights the transformative potential of integrating state-of-the-art object detection into digital numismatics, enabling more scalable, precise, and efficient analysis of historical artifacts. These advancements pave the way for new methodologies in cultural heritage research, artefact provenance studies, and the detection of forgeries.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19101">Reconstruction Target Matters in Masked Image Modeling for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Ma, Yixiong Zou, Yuhua Li, Ruixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) requires the model to transfer knowledge from the data-abundant source domain to data-scarce target domains for fast adaptation, where the large domain gap makes CDFSL a challenging problem. Masked Autoencoder (MAE) excels in effectively using unlabeled data and learning image's global structures, enhancing model generalization and robustness. However, in the CDFSL task with significant domain shifts, we find MAE even shows lower performance than the baseline supervised models. In this paper, we first delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that MAE tends to focus on low-level domain information during reconstructing pixels while changing the reconstruction target to token features could mitigate this problem. However, not all features are beneficial, as we then find reconstructing high-level features can hardly improve the model's transferability, indicating a trade-off between filtering domain information and preserving the image's global structure. In all, the reconstruction target matters for the CDFSL task. Based on the above findings and interpretations, we further propose Domain-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling (DAMIM) for the CDFSL task. DAMIM includes an Aggregated Feature Reconstruction module to automatically aggregate features for reconstruction, with balanced learning of domain-agnostic information and images' global structure, and a Lightweight Decoder module to further benefit the encoder's generalizability. Experiments on four CDFSL datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we dive deep into the impact of additive noise in pre-training deep networks. While various methods have attempted to use additive noise inspired by the success of latent denoising diffusion models, when used in combination with masked image modeling, their gains have been marginal when it comes to recognition tasks. We thus investigate why this would be the case, in an attempt to find effective ways to combine the two ideas. Specifically, we find three critical conditions: corruption and restoration must be applied within the encoder, noise must be introduced in the feature space, and an explicit disentanglement between noised and masked tokens is necessary. By implementing these findings, we demonstrate improved pre-training performance for a wide range of recognition tasks, including those that require fine-grained, high-frequency information to solve.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyuan Ge, Zhihao Chen, Ziyang Wang, Jiaju Kang, Mingya Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of deep learning has facilitated the application of person re-identification (ReID) technology in intelligent security. Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrians across infrared and visible modality images enabling 24-hour surveillance. Current studies relying on unsupervised modality transformations as well as inefficient embedding constraints to bridge the spectral differences between infrared and visible images, however, limit their potential performance. To tackle the limitations of the above approaches, this paper introduces a simple yet effective Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-anchor Guidance Network, named SEPG-Net. Specifically, we propose a more homogeneous spectral enhancement scheme based on frequency domain information and greyscale space, which avoids the information loss typically caused by inefficient modality transformations. Further, a Pseudo Anchor-guided Bidirectional Aggregation (PABA) loss is introduced to bridge local modality discrepancies while better preserving discriminative identity embeddings. Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEPG-Net against other state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical imaging, addressing the chronic challenge of limited labeled data in healthcare settings. While SSL has shown impressive results, existing studies in the medical domain are often limited in scope, focusing on specific datasets or modalities, or evaluating only isolated aspects of model performance. This fragmented evaluation approach poses a significant challenge, as models deployed in critical medical settings must not only achieve high accuracy but also demonstrate robust performance and generalizability across diverse datasets and varying conditions. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive evaluation of SSL methods within the medical domain, with a particular focus on robustness and generalizability. Using the MedMNIST dataset collection as a standardized benchmark, we evaluate 8 major SSL methods across 11 different medical datasets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of model performance in both in-domain scenarios and the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, while exploring the effect of various initialization strategies, model architectures, and multi-domain pre-training. We further assess the generalizability of SSL methods through cross-dataset evaluations and the in-domain performance with varying label proportions (1%, 10%, and 100%) to simulate real-world scenarios with limited supervision. We hope this comprehensive benchmark helps practitioners and researchers make more informed decisions when applying SSL methods to medical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce AKT (Advanced Knowledge Transfer), a novel method to enhance the training ability of low-bit quantized (Q) models in the field of zero-shot quantization (ZSQ). Existing research in ZSQ has focused on generating high-quality data from full-precision (FP) models. However, these approaches struggle with reduced learning ability in low-bit quantization due to its limited information capacity. To overcome this limitation, we propose effective training strategy compared to data generation. Particularly, we analyzed that refining feature maps in the feature distillation process is an effective way to transfer knowledge to the Q model. Based on this analysis, AKT efficiently transfer core information from the FP model to the Q model. AKT is the first approach to utilize both spatial and channel attention information in feature distillation in ZSQ. Our method addresses the fundamental gradient exploding problem in low-bit Q models. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the AKT. Our method led to significant performance enhancement in existing generative models. Notably, AKT achieved significant accuracy improvements in low-bit Q models, achieving state-of-the-art in the 3,5bit scenarios on CIFAR-10.

Our work explores more precise quantization methods and introduces a new framework, Semantic Residual Cross-modal Information Disentanglement (SRCID), inspired by the numerical residual concept inherent to Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ). SRCID employs semantic residual-based information disentanglement for multimodal data to better handle the inherent discrepancies between different modalities. Our method enhances the capabilities of unified multimodal representations and demonstrates exceptional performance in cross-modal generalization and cross-modal zero-shot retrieval. Its average results significantly surpass existing state-of-the-art models, as well as previous attempts with RVQ and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) based on these modals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeonggwon Lee, Junkyu Park, Khang Truong Giang, Sungho Jo, Soohwan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of online 3D model generation for neural rendering using an RGB image stream. Previous research has tackled this issue by incorporating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as scene representations within dense SLAM methods. However, most studies focus primarily on estimating coarse 3D scenes rather than achieving detailed reconstructions. Moreover, depth estimation based solely on images is often ambiguous, resulting in low-quality 3D models that lead to inaccurate renderings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for high-quality 3DGS modeling that leverages an online multi-view stereo (MVS) approach. Our method estimates MVS depth using sequential frames from a local time window and applies comprehensive depth refinement techniques to filter out outliers, enabling accurate initialization of Gaussians in 3DGS. Furthermore, we introduce a parallelized backend module that optimizes the 3DGS model efficiently, ensuring timely updates with each new keyframe. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art dense SLAM methods, particularly excelling in challenging outdoor environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) aims to learn modality-invariant features from unlabeled cross-modality datasets and reduce the inter-modality gap. However, the existing methods lack cross-modality clustering or excessively pursue cluster-level association, which makes it difficult to perform reliable modality-invariant features learning. To deal with this issue, we propose a Extended Cross-Modality United Learning (ECUL) framework, incorporating Extended Modality-Camera Clustering (EMCC) and Two-Step Memory Updating Strategy (TSMem) modules. Specifically, we design ECUL to naturally integrates intra-modality clustering, inter-modality clustering and inter-modality instance selection, establishing compact and accurate cross-modality associations while reducing the introduction of noisy labels. Moreover, EMCC captures and filters the neighborhood relationships by extending the encoding vector, which further promotes the learning of modality-invariant and camera-invariant knowledge in terms of clustering algorithm. Finally, TSMem provides accurate and generalized proxy points for contrastive learning by updating the memory in stages. Extensive experiments results on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate that the proposed ECUL shows promising performance and even outperforms certain supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Chen, Ben Kang, Wanting Geng, Jiawen Zhu, Yi Liu, Dong Wang, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple yet unified single object tracking (SOT) framework, dubbed SUTrack. It consolidates five SOT tasks (RGB-based, RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-Event, RGB-Language Tracking) into a unified model trained in a single session. Due to the distinct nature of the data, current methods typically design individual architectures and train separate models for each task. This fragmentation results in redundant training processes, repetitive technological innovations, and limited cross-modal knowledge sharing. In contrast, SUTrack demonstrates that a single model with a unified input representation can effectively handle various common SOT tasks, eliminating the need for task-specific designs and separate training sessions. Additionally, we introduce a task-recognition auxiliary training strategy and a soft token type embedding to further enhance SUTrack's performance with minimal overhead. Experiments show that SUTrack outperforms previous task-specific counterparts across 11 datasets spanning five SOT tasks. Moreover, we provide a range of models catering edge devices as well as high-performance GPUs, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. We hope SUTrack could serve as a strong foundation for further compelling research into unified tracking models. Code and models are available at github.com/chenxin-dlut/SUTrack.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video procedure planning, i.e., planning a sequence of action steps given the video frames of start and goal states, is an essential ability for embodied AI. Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Today, manga has gained worldwide popularity. However, the question of how various elements of manga, such as characters, text, and panel layouts, reflect the uniqueness of a particular work, or even define it, remains an unexplored area. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the visual characteristics of manga works, with a particular focus on panel layout features. As a research method, we used facing page images of manga as input to train a deep learning model for predicting manga titles, examining classification accuracy to quantitatively analyze these features. Specifically, we conducted ablation studies by limiting page image information to panel frames to analyze the characteristics of panel layouts. Through a series of quantitative experiments using all 104 works, 12 genres, and 10,122 facing page images from the Manga109 dataset, as well as qualitative analysis using Grad-CAM, our study demonstrates that the uniqueness of manga works is strongly reflected in their panel layouts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Jiao, Haoye Dong, Yuyang Yin, Zequn Jie, Yinlong Qian, Yao Zhao, Humphrey Shi, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works in 3D multimodal learning have made remarkable progress. However, typically 3D multimodal models are only capable of handling point clouds. Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19145">Impact of color and mixing proportion of synthetic point clouds on semantic segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaojie Zhou, Jia-Rui Lin, Peng Pan, Yuandong Pan, Ioannis Brilakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of point clouds is essential for understanding the built environment, and a large amount of high-quality data is required for training deep learning models. Despite synthetic point clouds (SPC) having the potential to compensate for the shortage of real data, how to exploit the benefits of SPC is still open. Therefore, this study systematically investigates how color and mixing proportion of SPC impact semantic segmentation for the first time. First, a new method to mimic the scanning process and generate SPC based on BIM is proposed, to create a synthetic dataset with consistent colors of BIM (UniSPC) and a synthetic dataset with real colors (RealSPC) respectively. Subsequently, by integrating with the S3DIS dataset, further experiments on PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN are conducted. Meanwhile, benchmark experiments and new evaluation metrics are introduced to better evaluate the performance of different models. Experiments show that synthetic color significantly impacts model performance, the performance for common components of the models trained with pure RealSPC is comparable to models with real data, and RealSPC contributes average improvements of 14.1% on overall accuracy and 7.3% on mIoU than UniSPC. Furthermore, the proportion of SPC also has a significant impact on the performance. In mixing training experiments, adding more than 70% SPC achieves an average of 3.9% on overall accuracy and 3.4% on mIoU better than benchmark on three models. It is also revealed that for large flat elements such as floors, ceilings, and walls, the SPC can even replace real point clouds without compromising model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Yang, Yifan Wu, Yizhang Zhu, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart understanding tasks such as ChartQA and Chart-to-Text involve automatically extracting and interpreting key information from charts, enabling users to query or convert visual data into structured formats. State-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on visual cues from chart images, failing to explicitly incorporate rich textual information (e.g., data labels and axis labels) embedded within the charts. This textual information is vital for intuitive human comprehension and interpretation of charts. Moreover, existing models are often large and computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we introduce AskChart, a universal model that explicitly integrates both textual and visual cues from charts using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. AskChart facilitates the learning of enhanced visual-textual representations of charts for effectively handling multiple chart understanding tasks, while maintaining a smaller model size. To capture the synergy between visual and textual modalities, we curate a large-scale dataset named ChartBank with about 7.5M data samples, which helps align textual and visual information and facilitates the extraction of visual entities and text. To effectively train AskChart, we design a three-stage training strategy to align visual and textual modalities for learning robust visual-textual representations and optimizing the learning of the MoE layer. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate the significant performance gains of AskChart in four chart understanding tasks. Remarkably, AskChart with 4.6B parameters outperforms state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters by 68.3% in Open-ended ChartQA and 49.2% in Chart-to-Text tasks, while achieving comparable performance in ChartQA and Chart-to-Table tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guohao Li, Hongyu Yang, Yifang Men, Di Huang, Weixin Li, Ruijie Yang, Yunhong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating animatable and editable 3D head avatars is essential for various applications in computer vision and graphics. Traditional 3D-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs), often using implicit fields like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), achieve photorealistic and view-consistent 3D head synthesis. However, these methods face limitations in deformation flexibility and editability, hindering the creation of lifelike and easily modifiable 3D heads. We propose a novel approach that enhances the editability and animation control of 3D head avatars by incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit 3D representation. This method enables easier illumination control and improved editability. Central to our approach is the Editable Gaussian Head (EG-Head) model, which combines a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with texture maps, allowing precise expression control and flexible texture editing for accurate animation while preserving identity. To capture complex non-facial geometries like hair, we use an auxiliary set of 3DGS and tri-plane features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers high-quality 3D-aware synthesis with state-of-the-art controllability.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19155">Referencing Where to Focus: Improving VisualGrounding with Referential Query</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yabing Wang, Zhuotao Tian, Qingpei Guo, Zheng Qin, Sanping Zhou, Ming Yang, Le Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Grounding aims to localize the referring object in an image given a natural language expression. Recent advancements in DETR-based visual grounding methods have attracted considerable attention, as they directly predict the coordinates of the target object without relying on additional efforts, such as pre-generated proposal candidates or pre-defined anchor boxes. However, existing research primarily focuses on designing stronger multi-modal decoder, which typically generates learnable queries by random initialization or by using linguistic embeddings. This vanilla query generation approach inevitably increases the learning difficulty for the model, as it does not involve any target-related information at the beginning of decoding. Furthermore, they only use the deepest image feature during the query learning process, overlooking the importance of features from other levels. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, called RefFormer. It consists of the query adaption module that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP and generate the referential query to provide the prior context for decoder, along with a task-specific decoder. By incorporating the referential query into the decoder, we can effectively mitigate the learning difficulty of the decoder, and accurately concentrate on the target object. Additionally, our proposed query adaption module can also act as an adapter, preserving the rich knowledge within CLIP without the need to tune the parameters of the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on five visual grounding benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arun K. Sharma, Shubhobrata Bhattacharya, Motahar Reza</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional biometric systems, like face and fingerprint recognition, have encountered significant setbacks due to wearing face masks and hygiene concerns. To meet the challenges of the partially covered face due to face masks and hygiene concerns of fingerprint recognition, this paper proposes a novel dual-channel multi-attention Vision Transformer (ViT) framework for biometric authentication using forehead subcutaneous vein patterns and periocular patterns, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods, capable of performing well even with face masks and without any physical touch. The proposed framework leverages a dual-channel ViT architecture, designed to handle two distinct biometric traits. It can capture long-range dependencies of independent features from the vein and periocular patterns. A custom classifier is then designed to integrate the independently extracted features, producing a final class prediction. The performance of the proposed algorithm was rigorously evaluated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database. The results demonstrated the superiority of the algorithm over state-of-the-art methods, achieving remarkable classification accuracy of $99.3 \pm 0.02\%$ with the combined vein and periocular patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiude Zhang, Chunyu Lin, Zhijie Shen, Nie Lang, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is challenging due to the lack of accurate depth. However, existing depth-assisted solutions still exhibit inferior performance, whose reason is universally acknowledged as the unsatisfactory accuracy of monocular depth estimation models. In this paper, we revisit monocular 3D object detection from the depth perspective and formulate an additional issue as the limited 3D structure-aware capability of existing depth representations (\textit{e.g.}, depth one-hot encoding or depth distribution). To address this issue, we propose a novel depth-adapted monocular 3D object detection network, termed \textbf{RD3D}, that mainly comprises a Scene-Level Depth Retargeting (SDR) module and an Instance-Level Spatial Refinement (ISR) module. The former incorporates the scene-level perception of 3D structures, retargeting traditional depth representations to a new formulation: \textbf{Depth Thickness Field}. The latter refines the voxel spatial representation with the guidance of instances, eliminating the ambiguity of 3D occupation and thus improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate our superiority to existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods and the universality when equipped with different depth estimation models. The code will be available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19178">Reversed in Time: A Novel Temporal-Emphasized Benchmark for Cross-Modal Video-Text Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Du, Yuqi Liu, Qin Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset\footnote{\url{https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time}} to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongwei Sun, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing image change description, as a novel multimodal task in the field of remote sensing processing, not only enables the detection of changes in surface conditions but also provides detailed descriptions of these changes, thereby enhancing human interpretability and interactivity. However, previous methods mainly employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to extract bitemporal image features. This approach often leads to an overemphasis on designing specific network architectures and limits the captured feature distributions to the current dataset, resulting in poor generalizability and robustness when applied to other datasets or real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach for remote sensing image change detection and description that integrates diffusion models, aiming to shift the focus from conventional feature learning paradigms to data distribution learning. The proposed method primarily includes a simple multi-scale change detection module, whose output features are subsequently refined using a diffusion model. Additionally, we introduce a frequency-guided complex filter module to handle high-frequency noise during the diffusion process, which helps to maintain model performance. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on several remote sensing change detection description datasets, demonstrating its superior performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjing Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal learning, the image-text matching task, as a bridge connecting vision and language, has become increasingly important. Based on existing research, this study proposes an innovative visual semantic embedding model, Multi-Headed Consensus-Aware Visual-Semantic Embedding (MH-CVSE). This model introduces a multi-head self-attention mechanism based on the consensus-aware visual semantic embedding model (CVSE) to capture information in multiple subspaces in parallel, significantly enhancing the model's ability to understand and represent the complex relationship between images and texts. In addition, we adopt a parameterized feature fusion strategy to flexibly integrate feature information at different levels, further improving the model's expressive power. In terms of loss function design, the MH-CVSE model adopts a dynamic weight adjustment strategy to dynamically adjust the weight according to the loss value itself, so that the model can better balance the contribution of different loss terms during training. At the same time, we introduce a cosine annealing learning rate strategy to help the model converge more stably in the later stages of training. Extensive experimental verification on the Flickr30k dataset shows that the MH-CVSE model achieves better performance than previous methods in both bidirectional image and text retrieval tasks, fully demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Alhawwary, Phong Nguyen-Ha, Janne Mustaniemi, Janne Heikkil\"a</p>
<p>Abstract: Portraits or selfie images taken from a close distance typically suffer from perspective distortion. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based rectification pipeline to mitigate the effects of perspective distortion. We learn to predict the facial depth by training a deep CNN. The estimated depth is utilized to adjust the camera-to-subject distance by moving the camera farther, increasing the camera focal length, and reprojecting the 3D image features to the new perspective. The reprojected features are then fed to an inpainting module to fill in the missing pixels. We leverage a differentiable renderer to enable end-to-end training of our depth estimation and feature extraction nets to improve the rectified outputs. To boost the results of the inpainting module, we incorporate an auxiliary module to predict the horizontal movement of the camera which decreases the area that requires hallucination of challenging face parts such as ears. Unlike previous works, we process the full-frame input image at once without cropping the subject's face and processing it separately from the rest of the body, eliminating the need for complex post-processing steps to attach the face back to the subject's body. To train our network, we utilize the popular game engine Unreal Engine to generate a large synthetic face dataset containing various subjects, head poses, expressions, eyewear, clothes, and lighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our rectification pipeline outperforms previous methods, and produces comparable results with a time-consuming 3D GAN-based method while being more than 260 times faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekang Yang, Wang Zeng, Sheng Jin, Chen Qian, Ping Luo, Wentao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing effective neural architectures poses a significant challenge in deep learning. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the search for optimal architectures, existing methods are often constrained by predetermined search spaces and may miss critical neural architectures. In this paper, we introduce NADER (Neural Architecture Design via multi-agEnt collaboRation), a novel framework that formulates neural architecture design (NAD) as a LLM-based multi-agent collaboration problem. NADER employs a team of specialized agents to enhance a base architecture through iterative modification. Current LLM-based NAD methods typically operate independently, lacking the ability to learn from past experiences, which results in repeated mistakes and inefficient exploration. To address this issue, we propose the Reflector, which effectively learns from immediate feedback and long-term experiences. Additionally, unlike previous LLM-based methods that use code to represent neural architectures, we utilize a graph-based representation. This approach allows agents to focus on design aspects without being distracted by coding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NADER in discovering high-performing architectures beyond predetermined search spaces through extensive experiments on benchmark tasks, showcasing its advantages over state-of-the-art methods. The codes will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Yan, Zhengxue Wang, Kun Wang, Jun Li, Jian Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Selective Image Guided Network (SigNet), a novel degradation-aware framework that transforms depth completion into depth enhancement for the first time. Moving beyond direct completion using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SigNet initially densifies sparse depth data through non-CNN densification tools to obtain coarse yet dense depth. This approach eliminates the mismatch and ambiguity caused by direct convolution over irregularly sampled sparse data. Subsequently, SigNet redefines completion as enhancement, establishing a self-supervised degradation bridge between the coarse depth and the targeted dense depth for effective RGB-D fusion. To achieve this, SigNet leverages the implicit degradation to adaptively select high-frequency components (e.g., edges) of RGB data to compensate for the coarse depth. This degradation is further integrated into a multi-modal conditional Mamba, dynamically generating the state parameters to enable efficient global high-frequency information interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on the NYUv2, DIML, SUN RGBD, and TOFDC datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of SigNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remote Sensing (RS) data contains a wealth of multi-dimensional information crucial for Earth observation. Owing to its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal properties, RS data is highly suitable for the development of large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). VFMs act as robust feature extractors, learning from extensive RS data, and are subsequently fine-tuned for deployment in various geoscientific tasks. However, current VFMs in the RS domain are predominantly pretrained and tailored exclusively for specific characteristics of RS imagery, neglecting the potential of utilizing the multi-dimensional properties of RS data. Therefore, in this work, we propose SeaMo, a pioneering visual foundation model that integrates multi-seasonal and multimodal information in the RS field. SeaMo is designed to harness multiple properties of RS data. Within the masked image modeling framework, we employ non-aligned cropping techniques to extract spatial properties, use multi-source inputs for multimodal integration, and incorporate temporal-multimodal fusion blocks for effective assimilation of multi-seasonal data. SeaMo explicitly models the multi-dimensional properties of RS data, making the model more comprehensive, robust, and versatile. We applied SeaMo to several downstream geoscience tasks, which demonstrated exceptional performance. Extensive ablation studies were conducted to validate the model's superiority.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated content (UGC) videos has produced an urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to monitor video quality and guide optimization and recommendation procedures. However, current VQA models generally only give an overall rating for a UGC video, which lacks fine-grained labels for serving video processing and recommendation applications. To address the challenges and promote the development of UGC videos, we establish the first large-scale Fine-grained Video quality assessment Database, termed FineVD, which comprises 6104 UGC videos with fine-grained quality scores and descriptions across multiple dimensions. Based on this database, we propose a Fine-grained Video Quality assessment (FineVQ) model to learn the fine-grained quality of UGC videos, with the capabilities of quality rating, quality scoring, and quality attribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FineVQ can produce fine-grained video-quality results and achieve state-of-the-art performance on FineVD and other commonly used UGC-VQA datasets.

<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis has experienced significant advancements owing to increasingly capable NeRF- and 3DGS-based methods. However, reflective object reconstruction remains challenging, lacking a proper solution to achieve real-time, high-quality rendering while accommodating inter-reflection. To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (\textbf{Ref-Gaussian}) framework characterized with two components: (I) {\em Physically based deferred rendering} that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) {\em Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection} that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taewhan Kim, Soeun Lee, Si-Woo Kim, Dong-Jin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent lightweight image captioning models using retrieved data mainly focus on text prompts. However, previous works only utilize the retrieved text as text prompts, and the visual information relies only on the CLIP visual embedding. Because of this issue, there is a limitation that the image descriptions inherent in the prompt are not sufficiently reflected in the visual embedding space. To tackle this issue, we propose ViPCap, a novel retrieval text-based visual prompt for lightweight image captioning. ViPCap leverages the retrieved text with image information as visual prompts to enhance the ability of the model to capture relevant visual information. By mapping text prompts into the CLIP space and generating multiple randomized Gaussian distributions, our method leverages sampling to explore randomly augmented distributions and effectively retrieves the semantic features that contain image information. These retrieved features are integrated into the image and designated as the visual prompt, leading to performance improvements on the datasets such as COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leiping Jie</p>
<p>Abstract: As the successor to the Segment Anything Model (SAM), the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) not only improves performance in image segmentation but also extends its capabilities to video segmentation. However, its effectiveness in segmenting rare objects that seldom appear in videos remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluate SAM2 on three distinct video segmentation tasks: Video Shadow Detection (VSD) and Video Mirror Detection (VMD). Specifically, we use ground truth point or mask prompts to initialize the first frame and then predict corresponding masks for subsequent frames. Experimental results show that SAM2's performance on these tasks is suboptimal, especially when point prompts are used, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Chen, Dengjie Li, Zenghao Bao, Yao Zhou, Lingfeng Tan, Yujie Zhong, Zheng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating comics through text is widely studied. However, there are few studies on generating multi-panel Manga (Japanese comics) solely based on plain text. Japanese manga contains multiple panels on a single page, with characteristics such as coherence in storytelling, reasonable and diverse page layouts, consistency in characters, and semantic correspondence between panel drawings and panel scripts. Therefore, generating manga poses a significant challenge. This paper presents the manga generation task and constructs the Manga109Story dataset for studying manga generation solely from plain text. Additionally, we propose MangaDiffusion to facilitate the intra-panel and inter-panel information interaction during the manga generation process. The results show that our method particularly ensures the number of panels, reasonable and diverse page layouts. Based on our approach, there is potential to converting a large amount of textual stories into more engaging manga readings, leading to significant application prospects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Amoroso, Gengyuan Zhang, Rajat Koner, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara, Volker Tresp</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a challenging video understanding task that requires models to comprehend entire videos, identify the most relevant information based on contextual cues from a given question, and reason accurately to provide answers. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed video QA by leveraging their exceptional commonsense reasoning capabilities. This progress is largely driven by the effective alignment between visual data and the language space of MLLMs. However, for video QA, an additional space-time alignment poses a considerable challenge for extracting question-relevant information across frames. In this work, we investigate diverse temporal modeling techniques to integrate with MLLMs, aiming to achieve question-guided temporal modeling that leverages pre-trained visual and textual alignment in MLLMs. We propose T-Former, a novel temporal modeling method that creates a question-guided temporal bridge between frame-wise visual perception and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluation across multiple video QA benchmarks demonstrates that T-Former competes favorably with existing temporal modeling approaches and aligns with recent advancements in video QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziang Yan, Zhilin Li, Yinan He, Chenting Wang, Kunchang Li, Xinhao Li, Xiangyu Zeng, Zilei Wang, Yali Wang, Yu Qiao, Limin Wang, Yi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with fine-grained or precise understanding of visuals though they give comprehensive perception and reasoning in a spectrum of vision applications. Recent studies either develop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive framework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address this issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we propose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes differentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks. TPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM. By leveraging rich visual labels during training, TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance. Through multi-task co-training within TPO, we observe synergistic benefits that elevate individual task performance beyond what is achievable through single-task training methodologies. Our instantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall 14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Yang, Jon S. Heiselman, Cheng Han, Kelly Merrell, Richard Simon, Cristian. A. Linte</p>
<p>Abstract: In image-guided liver surgery, the initial rigid alignment between preoperative and intraoperative data, often represented as point clouds, is crucial for providing sub-surface information from preoperative CT/MRI images to the surgeon during the procedure. Currently, this alignment is typically performed using semi-automatic methods, which, while effective to some extent, are prone to errors that demand manual correction. Point cloud correspondence-based registration methods are promising to serve as a fully automatic solution. However, they may struggle in scenarios with limited intraoperative surface visibility, a common challenge in liver surgery, particularly in laparoscopic procedures, which we refer to as complete-to-partial ambiguity. We first illustrate this ambiguity by evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art learning-based point cloud registration methods on our carefully constructed in silico and in vitro datasets. Then, we propose a patches-to-partial matching strategy as a plug-and-play module to resolve the ambiguity, which can be seamlessly integrated into learning-based registration methods without disrupting their end-to-end structure. It has proven effective and efficient in improving registration performance for cases with limited intraoperative visibility. The constructed benchmark and the proposed module establish a solid foundation for advancing applications of point cloud correspondence-based registration methods in image-guided liver surgery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiet A. Nguyen, Adheesh Juvekar, Tianjiao Yu, Muntasir Wahed, Ismini Lourentzou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have sparked significant progress in general-purpose vision tasks through visual instruction tuning. While some works have demonstrated the capability of LVLMs to generate segmentation masks that align phrases with natural language descriptions in a single image, they struggle with segmentation-grounded comparisons across multiple images, particularly at finer granularities such as object parts. In this paper, we introduce the new task of part-focused semantic co-segmentation, which seeks to identify and segment common and unique objects and parts across images. To address this task, we present CALICO, the first LVLM that can segment and reason over multiple masks across images, enabling object comparison based on their constituent parts. CALICO features two proposed components, a novel Correspondence Extraction Module, which captures semantic-rich information to identify part-level correspondences between objects, and a Correspondence Adaptation Module, which embeds this information into the LVLM to facilitate multi-image understanding in a parameter-efficient manner. To support training and evaluation, we curate MixedParts, a comprehensive multi-image segmentation dataset containing $\sim$2.4M samples across $\sim$44K images with diverse object and part categories. Experimental results show CALICO, finetuned on only 0.3% of its architecture, achieves robust performance in part-focused semantic co-segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Qiao, Apurba Adhikary, Kitae Kim, Eui-Nam Huh, Zhu Han, Choong Seon Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed training technology that enhances data privacy in mobile edge networks by allowing data owners to collaborate without transmitting raw data to the edge server. However, data heterogeneity and adversarial attacks pose challenges to develop an unbiased and robust global model for edge deployment. To address this, we propose Federated hyBrid Adversarial training and self-adversarial disTillation (FedBAT), a new framework designed to improve both robustness and generalization of the global model. FedBAT seamlessly integrates hybrid adversarial training and self-adversarial distillation into the conventional FL framework from data augmentation and feature distillation perspectives. From a data augmentation perspective, we propose hybrid adversarial training to defend against adversarial attacks by balancing accuracy and robustness through a weighted combination of standard and adversarial training. From a feature distillation perspective, we introduce a novel augmentation-invariant adversarial distillation method that aligns local adversarial features of augmented images with their corresponding unbiased global clean features. This alignment can effectively mitigate bias from data heterogeneity while enhancing both the robustness and generalization of the global model. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedBAT yields comparable or superior performance gains in improving robustness while maintaining accuracy compared to several baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gopi Raju Matta, Reddypalli Trisha, Kaushik Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel view synthesis has been greatly enhanced by the development of radiance field methods. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has effectively addressed key challenges, such as long training times and slow rendering speeds, typically associated with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), while maintaining high-quality reconstructions. In this work (BeSplat), we demonstrate the recovery of sharp radiance field (Gaussian splats) from a single motion-blurred image and its corresponding event stream. Our method jointly learns the scene representation via Gaussian Splatting and recovers the camera motion through Bezier SE(3) formulation effectively, minimizing discrepancies between synthesized and real-world measurements of both blurry image and corresponding event stream. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real datasets, showcasing its ability to render view-consistent, sharp images from the learned radiance field and the estimated camera trajectory. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to address this highly challenging ill-posed problem in a Gaussian Splatting framework with the effective incorporation of temporal information captured using the event stream.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation is an active area of research driven by the growing demand for robust machine learning models that perform well on real-world data. Adversarial learning for deep neural networks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising approach to improving generalization ability, particularly for image classification. In this paper, we implement a specific adversarial learning technique known as Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA) and replicate digit classification experiments from the original ADDA paper. We extend their findings by examining a broader range of domain shifts and provide a detailed analysis of in-domain classification accuracy post-ADDA. Our results demonstrate that ADDA significantly improves accuracy across certain domain shifts with minimal impact on in-domain performance. Furthermore, we provide qualitative analysis and propose potential explanations for ADDA's limitations in less successful domain shifts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Fan, Jianhua Wu, Jincheng Gao, Jianhao Yu, Yafei Wang, Hongqing Chu, Bingzhao Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown satisfactory effects in many autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, MLLMs are utilized to solve joint semantic scene understanding and risk localization tasks, while only relying on front-view images. In the proposed MLLM-SUL framework, a dual-branch visual encoder is first designed to extract features from two resolutions, and rich visual information is conducive to the language model describing risk objects of different sizes accurately. Then for the language generation, LLaMA model is fine-tuned to predict scene descriptions, containing the type of driving scenario, actions of risk objects, and driving intentions and suggestions of ego-vehicle. Ultimately, a transformer-based network incorporating a regression token is trained to locate the risk objects. Extensive experiments on the existing DRAMA-ROLISP dataset and the extended DRAMA-SRIS dataset demonstrate that our method is efficient, surpassing many state-of-the-art image-based and video-based methods. Specifically, our method achieves 80.1% BLEU-1 score and 298.5% CIDEr score in the scene understanding task, and 59.6% accuracy in the localization task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Jiang, Jiangwei Ren, Zizhuo Li, Xin Zhou, Dingkang Liang, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Image matching for both cross-view and cross-modality plays a critical role in multimodal perception. In practice, the modality gap caused by different imaging systems/styles poses great challenges to the matching task. Existing works try to extract invariant features for specific modalities and train on limited datasets, showing poor generalization. In this paper, we present MINIMA, a unified image matching framework for multiple cross-modal cases. Without pursuing fancy modules, our MINIMA aims to enhance universal performance from the perspective of data scaling up. For such purpose, we propose a simple yet effective data engine that can freely produce a large dataset containing multiple modalities, rich scenarios, and accurate matching labels. Specifically, we scale up the modalities from cheap but rich RGB-only matching data, by means of generative models. Under this setting, the matching labels and rich diversity of the RGB dataset are well inherited by the generated multimodal data. Benefiting from this, we construct MD-syn, a new comprehensive dataset that fills the data gap for general multimodal image matching. With MD-syn, we can directly train any advanced matching pipeline on randomly selected modality pairs to obtain cross-modal ability. Extensive experiments on in-domain and zero-shot matching tasks, including $19$ cross-modal cases, demonstrate that our MINIMA can significantly outperform the baselines and even surpass modality-specific methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bi'an Du, Wei Hu, Renjie Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have significantly accelerated the sampling process in diffusion models, yielding impressive results in synthesizing high-resolution images. To explore and extend these advancements to point-cloud-based 3D shape generation, we propose a novel Multi-scale Latent Point Consistency Model (MLPCM). Our MLPCM follows a latent diffusion framework and introduces hierarchical levels of latent representations, ranging from point-level to super-point levels, each corresponding to a different spatial resolution. We design a multi-scale latent integration module along with 3D spatial attention to effectively denoise the point-level latent representations conditioned on those from multiple super-point levels. Additionally, we propose a latent consistency model, learned through consistency distillation, that compresses the prior into a one-step generator. This significantly improves sampling efficiency while preserving the performance of the original teacher model. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks ShapeNet and ShapeNet-Vol demonstrate that MLPCM achieves a 100x speedup in the generation process, while surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of both shape quality and diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely used for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search due to its storage and search efficiency. However, existing deep hashing methods predominantly rely on abundant training data, leaving the more challenging scenario of low-resource adaptation for deep hashing relatively underexplored. This setting involves adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks with only an extremely small number of training samples available. Our preliminary benchmarks reveal that current methods suffer significant performance degradation due to the distribution shift caused by limited training samples. To address these challenges, we introduce Class-Calibration LoRA (CLoRA), a novel plug-and-play approach that dynamically constructs low-rank adaptation matrices by leveraging class-level textual knowledge embeddings. CLoRA effectively incorporates prior class knowledge as anchors, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning while maintaining the original data distribution. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Guided Discrete Optimization (KIDDO), a framework to utilize class knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of visual information and enhance the discriminability of hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method, Knowledge- Anchored Low-Resource Adaptation Hashing (KALAHash), significantly boosts retrieval performance and achieves a 4x data efficiency in low-resource scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) is a task of targeting at localizing complete action instances and categorizing them with video-level labels. Action-background ambiguity, primarily caused by background noise resulting from aggregation and intra-action variation, is a significant challenge for existing WS-TAL methods. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid multi-head attention (HMHA) module and generalized uncertainty-based evidential fusion (GUEF) module to address the problem. The proposed HMHA effectively enhances RGB and optical flow features by filtering redundant information and adjusting their feature distribution to better align with the WS-TAL task. Additionally, the proposed GUEF adaptively eliminates the interference of background noise by fusing snippet-level evidences to refine uncertainty measurement and select superior foreground feature information, which enables the model to concentrate on integral action instances to achieve better action localization and classification performance. Experimental results conducted on the THUMOS14 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for long-term action anticipation (LTA), the task of predicting action labels and their duration in a video given the observation of an initial untrimmed video interval. We build on an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel decoding and make two key contributions. First, we introduce a bi-directional action context regularizer module on the top of the decoder that ensures temporal context coherence in temporally adjacent segments. Second, we learn from classified segments a transition matrix that models the probability of transitioning from one action to another and the sequence is optimized globally over the full prediction interval. In addition, we use a specialized encoder for the task of action segmentation to increase the quality of the predictions in the observation interval at inference time, leading to a better understanding of the past. We validate our methods on four benchmark datasets for LTA, the EpicKitchen-55, EGTEA+, 50Salads and Breakfast demonstrating superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, including probabilistic models and also those based on Large Language Models, that assume trimmed video as input.

<p>Abstract: Capturing feature information effectively is of great importance in the field of computer vision. With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), concepts like residual connection and multiple scales promote continual performance gains in diverse deep learning vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture that it consists of residual feature-reutilization inceptions (ResFRI) or split-residual feature-reutilization inceptions (Split-ResFRI). And it is composed of four convolutional combinations of different structures connected by specially designed information interaction passages, which are utilized to extract multi-scale feature information and effectively increase the receptive field of the model. Moreover, according to the network structure designed above, Split-ResFRI can adjust the segmentation ratio of the input information, thereby reducing the number of parameters and guaranteeing the model performance. Specifically, in experiments based on popular vision datasets, such as CIFAR10 ($97.94$\%), CIFAR100 ($85.91$\%) and Tiny Imagenet ($70.54$\%), we obtain state-of-the-art results compared with other modern models under the premise that the model size is approximate and no additional data is used.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evolution of colour vision is captivating, as it reveals the adaptive strategies of extinct species while simultaneously inspiring innovations in modern imaging technology. In this study, we present a simplified model of visual transduction in the retina, introducing a novel opsin layer. We quantify evolutionary pressures by measuring machine vision recognition accuracy on colour images shaped by specific opsins. Building on this, we develop an evolutionary conservation optimisation algorithm to reconstruct the spectral sensitivity of opsins, enabling mutation-driven adaptations to to more effectively spot fruits or predators. This model condenses millions of years of evolution within seconds on GPU, providing an experimental framework to test long-standing hypotheses in evolutionary biology , such as vision of early mammals, primate trichromacy from gene duplication, retention of colour blindness, blue-shift of fish rod and multiple rod opsins with bioluminescence. Moreover, the model enables speculative explorations of hypothetical species, such as organisms with eyes adapted to the conditions on Mars. Our findings suggest a minimalist yet effective approach to task-specific camera filter design, optimising the spectral response function to meet application-driven demands.

<p>Abstract: Generative AI has transformed the animation industry. Several models have been developed for image-to-image translation, particularly focusing on converting real-world images into anime through unpaired translation. Scenimefy, a notable approach utilizing contrastive learning, achieves high fidelity anime scene translation by addressing limited paired data through semi-supervised training. However, it faces limitations due to its reliance on paired data from a fine-tuned StyleGAN in the anime domain, often producing low-quality datasets. Additionally, Scenimefy's high parameter architecture presents opportunities for computational optimization. This research introduces NijiGAN, a novel model incorporating Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NeuralODEs), which offer unique advantages in continuous transformation modeling compared to traditional residual networks. NijiGAN successfully transforms real-world scenes into high fidelity anime visuals using half of Scenimefy's parameters. It employs pseudo-paired data generated through Scenimefy for supervised training, eliminating dependence on low-quality paired data and improving the training process. Our comprehensive evaluation includes ablation studies, qualitative, and quantitative analysis comparing NijiGAN to similar models. The testing results demonstrate that NijiGAN produces higher-quality images compared to AnimeGAN, as evidenced by a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 2.192, it surpasses AnimeGAN's MOS of 2.160. Furthermore, our model achieved a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 58.71, outperforming Scenimefy's FID score of 60.32.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuewei Li, Zhenzhen Nie, Mei Yu, Zijian Zhang, Jie Gao, Tianyi Xu, Zhiqiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Instance features in images exhibit spurious correlations with background features, affecting the training process of deep neural classifiers. This leads to insufficient attention to instance features by the classifier, resulting in erroneous classification outcomes. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method called Spurious Correlations Guided Synthesis (SCGS) that mitigates spurious correlations through image generation model. This approach does not require expensive spurious attribute (group) labels for the training data and can be widely applied to other debiasing methods. Specifically, SCGS first identifies the incorrect attention regions of a pre-trained classifier on the training images, and then uses an image generation model to generate new training data based on these incorrect attended regions. SCGS increases the diversity and scale of the dataset to reduce the impact of spurious correlations on classifiers. Changes in the classifier's attention regions and experimental results on three different domain datasets demonstrate that this method is effective in reducing the classifier's reliance on spurious correlations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyuan Liang, Zhiying Yan, Liqun Chen, Jiahuan Zhou, Luxin Yan, Sheng Zhong, Xu Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems require diverse data for robust training and evaluation, which can be augmented by manipulating object positions and appearances within existing scene captures. While recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in video editing, their application to object manipulation in driving scenarios remains challenging due to imprecise positional control and difficulties in preserving high-fidelity object appearances. To address these challenges in position and appearance control, we introduce DriveEditor, a diffusion-based framework for object editing in driving videos. DriveEditor offers a unified framework for comprehensive object editing operations, including repositioning, replacement, deletion, and insertion. These diverse manipulations are all achieved through a shared set of varying inputs, processed by identical position control and appearance maintenance modules. The position control module projects the given 3D bounding box while preserving depth information and hierarchically injects it into the diffusion process, enabling precise control over object position and orientation. The appearance maintenance module preserves consistent attributes with a single reference image by employing a three-tiered approach: low-level detail preservation, high-level semantic maintenance, and the integration of 3D priors from a novel view synthesis model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate DriveEditor's exceptional fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scene edits, as well as its remarkable ability to facilitate downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehoon Cho, Minjung Yoo, Jini Yang, Sunok Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of single-image de-raining, a task that involves recovering rain-free background information from a single rain image. While recent advancements have utilized real-world time-lapse data for training, enabling the estimation of consistent backgrounds and realistic rain streaks, these methods often suffer from computational and memory consumption, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel solution: the Rain Streak Prototype Unit (RsPU). The RsPU efficiently encodes rain streak-relevant features as real-time prototypes derived from time-lapse data, eliminating the need for excessive memory resources. Our de-raining network combines encoder-decoder networks with the RsPU, allowing us to learn and encapsulate diverse rain streak-relevant features as concise prototypes, employing an attention-based approach. To ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we propose a feature prototype loss encompassing cohesion and divergence components. This loss function captures both the compactness and diversity aspects of the prototypical rain streak features within the RsPU. Our method evaluates various de-raining benchmarks, accompanied by comprehensive ablation studies. We show that it can achieve competitive results in various rain images compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw, Aryan Yadav, Jasmer Singh Sanjotra, Shalini Dangi, Nagendra Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Objective: To develop a novel deep learning framework for the automated segmentation of colonic polyps in colonoscopy images, overcoming the limitations of current approaches in preserving precise polyp boundaries, incorporating multi-scale features, and modeling spatial dependencies that accurately reflect the intricate and diverse morphology of polyps. Methods: To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiscale Network with Spatial-enhanced Attention (MNet-SAt) for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. This framework incorporates four key modules: Edge-Guided Feature Enrichment (EGFE) preserves edge information for improved boundary quality; Multi-Scale Feature Aggregator (MSFA) extracts and aggregates multi-scale features across channel spatial dimensions, focusing on salient regions; Spatial-Enhanced Attention (SEAt) captures spatial-aware global dependencies within the multi-scale aggregated features, emphasizing the region of interest; and Channel-Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CE-ASPP) resamples and recalibrates attentive features across scales. Results: We evaluated MNet-SAt on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficients of 96.61% and 98.60%, respectively. Conclusion: Both quantitative (DSC) and qualitative assessments highlight MNet-SAt's superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods. Significance: MNet-SAt's high accuracy in polyp segmentation holds promise for improving clinical workflows in early polyp detection and more effective treatment, contributing to reduced colorectal cancer mortality rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Helmet detection is crucial for advancing protection levels in public road traffic dynamics. This problem statement translates to an object detection task. Therefore, this paper compares recent You Only Look Once (YOLO) models in the context of helmet detection in terms of reliability and computational load. Specifically, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and the newly released YOLOv11 have been used. Besides, a modified architectural pipeline that remarkably improves the overall performance has been proposed in this manuscript. This hybridized YOLO model (h-YOLO) has been pitted against the independent models for analysis that proves h-YOLO is preferable for helmet detection over plain YOLO models. The models were tested using a range of standard object detection benchmarks such as recall, precision, and mAP (Mean Average Precision). In addition, training and testing times were recorded to provide the overall scope of the models in a real-time detection scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengdong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In everyday life, photographs taken with a camera often suffer from motion blur due to hand vibrations or sudden movements. This phenomenon can significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels. In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a good image restoration effect in real world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Li, Xiang Liu, Xiaodong Wang, Xin Yuan, Peidong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) technique for recovering the underlying 3D scene structure from a single temporal compressed image. SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, reducing storage and transmission requirements and offering potential privacy protection. Inspired by this, we take one step further to recover the encoded 3D scene information leveraging powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we propose SCINeRF, in which we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF, allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene structures. In addition, we further integrate the popular 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework and propose SCISplat to improve 3D scene reconstruction quality and training/rendering speed by explicitly optimizing point clouds into 3D Gaussian representations. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, our method also exhibits the ability to render high frame-rate multi-view consistent images in real time by leveraging SCI and the rendering capabilities of 3DGS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Wang, Zhen Zhao, Luping Zhou, Parashkev Nachev</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain decoding aims to reconstruct original stimuli from fMRI signals, providing insights into interpreting mental content. Current approaches rely heavily on subject-specific models due to the complex brain processing mechanisms and the variations in fMRI signals across individuals. Therefore, these methods greatly limit the generalization of models and fail to capture cross-subject commonalities. To address this, we present UniBrain, a unified brain decoding model that requires no subject-specific parameters. Our approach includes a group-based extractor to handle variable fMRI signal lengths, a mutual assistance embedder to capture cross-subject commonalities, and a bilevel feature alignment scheme for extracting subject-invariant features. We validate our UniBrain on the brain decoding benchmark, achieving comparable performance to current state-of-the-art subject-specific models with extremely fewer parameters. We also propose a generalization benchmark to encourage the community to emphasize cross-subject commonalities for more general brain decoding.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19489">RAIN: Real-time Animation of Infinite Video Stream</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhilei Shu, Ruili Feng, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha</p>
<p>Abstract: Live animation has gained immense popularity for enhancing online engagement, yet achieving high-quality, real-time, and stable animation with diffusion models remains challenging, especially on consumer-grade GPUs. Existing methods struggle with generating long, consistent video streams efficiently, often being limited by latency issues and degraded visual quality over extended periods. In this paper, we introduce RAIN, a pipeline solution capable of animating infinite video streams in real-time with low latency using a single RTX 4090 GPU. The core idea of RAIN is to efficiently compute frame-token attention across different noise levels and long time-intervals while simultaneously denoising a significantly larger number of frame-tokens than previous stream-based methods. This design allows RAIN to generate video frames with much shorter latency and faster speed, while maintaining long-range attention over extended video streams, resulting in enhanced continuity and consistency. Consequently, a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned with RAIN in just a few epochs can produce video streams in real-time and low latency without much compromise in quality or consistency, up to infinite long. Despite its advanced capabilities, the RAIN only introduces a few additional 1D attention blocks, imposing minimal additional burden. Experiments in benchmark datasets and generating super-long videos demonstrating that RAIN can animate characters in real-time with much better quality, accuracy, and consistency than competitors while costing less latency. All code and models will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Jiu, Hailong Zhu, Hichem Sahbi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-label classification is a challenging task in pattern recognition. Many deep learning methods have been proposed and largely enhanced classification performance. However, most of the existing sophisticated methods ignore context in the models' learning process. Since context may provide additional cues to the learned models, it may significantly boost classification performances. In this work, we make full use of context information (namely geometrical structure of images) in order to learn better context-aware similarities (a.k.a. kernels) between images. We reformulate context-aware kernel design as a feed-forward network that outputs explicit kernel mapping features. Our obtained context-aware kernel network further leverages multiple orders of patch neighbors within different distances, resulting into a more discriminating Deep Multi-order Context-aware Kernel Network (DMCKN) for multi-label classification. We evaluate the proposed method on the challenging Corel5K and NUS-WIDE benchmarks, and empirical results show that our method obtains competitive performances against the related state-of-the-art, and both quantitative and qualitative performances corroborate its effectiveness and superiority for multi-label image classification.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19492">Towards Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyang Ye, Yunzhi Zhuge, Pingping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, deep learning based methods have revolutionized remote sensing image segmentation. However, these methods usually rely on a pre-defined semantic class set, thus needing additional image annotation and model training when adapting to new classes. More importantly, they are unable to segment arbitrary semantic classes. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation (OVRSISS), which aims to segment arbitrary semantic classes in remote sensing images. To address the lack of OVRSISS datasets, we develop LandDiscover50K, a comprehensive dataset of 51,846 images covering 40 diverse semantic classes. In addition, we propose a novel framework named GSNet that integrates domain priors from special remote sensing models and versatile capabilities of general vision-language models. Technically, GSNet consists of a Dual-Stream Image Encoder (DSIE), a Query-Guided Feature Fusion (QGFF), and a Residual Information Preservation Decoder (RIPD). DSIE first captures comprehensive features from both special models and general models in dual streams. Then, with the guidance of variable vocabularies, QGFF integrates specialist and generalist features, enabling them to complement each other. Finally, RIPD is proposed to aggregate multi-source features for more accurate mask predictions. Experiments show that our method outperforms other methods by a large margin, and our proposed LandDiscover50K improves the performance of OVRSISS methods. The proposed dataset and method will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yecy749/GSNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in scene text spotting have focused on end-to-end methodologies that heavily rely on precise location annotations, which are often costly and labor-intensive to procure. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages only transcription annotations for training text spotting models, substantially reducing the dependency on elaborate annotation processes. Our methodology employs a query-based paradigm that facilitates the learning of implicit location features through the interaction between text queries and image embeddings. These features are later refined during the text recognition phase using an attention activation map. Addressing the challenges associated with training a weakly-supervised model from scratch, we implement a circular curriculum learning strategy to enhance model convergence. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine cross-attention localization mechanism for more accurate text instance localization. Notably, our framework supports audio-based annotation, which significantly diminishes annotation time and provides an inclusive alternative for individuals with disabilities. Our approach achieves competitive performance against existing benchmarks, demonstrating that high accuracy in text spotting can be attained without extensive location annotations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotao Hu, Wei Yin, Mingkai Jia, Junyuan Deng, Xiaoyang Guo, Qian Zhang, Xiaoxiao Long, Ping Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent successes in autoregressive (AR) generation models, such as the GPT series in natural language processing, have motivated efforts to replicate this success in visual tasks. Some works attempt to extend this approach to autonomous driving by building video-based world models capable of generating realistic future video sequences and predicting ego states. However, prior works tend to produce unsatisfactory results, as the classic GPT framework is designed to handle 1D contextual information, such as text, and lacks the inherent ability to model the spatial and temporal dynamics essential for video generation. In this paper, we present DrivingWorld, a GPT-style world model for autonomous driving, featuring several spatial-temporal fusion mechanisms. This design enables effective modeling of both spatial and temporal dynamics, facilitating high-fidelity, long-duration video generation. Specifically, we propose a next-state prediction strategy to model temporal coherence between consecutive frames and apply a next-token prediction strategy to capture spatial information within each frame. To further enhance generalization ability, we propose a novel masking strategy and reweighting strategy for token prediction to mitigate long-term drifting issues and enable precise control. Our work demonstrates the ability to produce high-fidelity and consistent video clips of over 40 seconds in duration, which is over 2 times longer than state-of-the-art driving world models. Experiments show that, in contrast to prior works, our method achieves superior visual quality and significantly more accurate controllable future video generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyao Li, Yingchun Hu, Xuefei Ning, Xihui Liu, Ke Hong, Xiaotao Jia, Xiuhong Li, Yaqi Yan, Pei Ran, Guohao Dai, Shengen Yan, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled a variety of real-world applications. The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and computation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task accuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B VLMs, compared to SOTA baselines. Additionally, we implement a W3 GPU kernel that fuses the dequantization and GEMV operators, achieving a 1.4x speedup on LLaVA-onevision-7B on the RTX 4090.

<p>Abstract: Photo-realistic scene reconstruction from sparse-view, uncalibrated images is highly required in practice. Although some successes have been made, existing methods are either Sparse-View but require accurate camera parameters (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic), or SfM-free but need densely captured images. To combine the advantages of both methods while addressing their respective weaknesses, we propose Dust to Tower (D2T), an accurate and efficient coarse-to-fine framework to optimize 3DGS and image poses simultaneously from sparse and uncalibrated images. Our key idea is to first construct a coarse model efficiently and subsequently refine it using warped and inpainted images at novel viewpoints. To do this, we first introduce a Coarse Construction Module (CCM) which exploits a fast Multi-View Stereo model to initialize a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and recover initial camera poses. To refine the 3D model at novel viewpoints, we propose a Confidence Aware Depth Alignment (CADA) module to refine the coarse depth maps by aligning their confident parts with estimated depths by a Mono-depth model. Then, a Warped Image-Guided Inpainting (WIGI) module is proposed to warp the training images to novel viewpoints by the refined depth maps, and inpainting is applied to fulfill the ``holes" in the warped images caused by view-direction changes, providing high-quality supervision to further optimize the 3D model and the camera poses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the validity of D2T and its design choices, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of novel view synthesis and pose estimation while keeping high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, a prevalent training technique involves utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) for image re-captioning. Even though VLMs are known to exhibit hallucination, generating descriptive content that deviates from the visual reality, the ramifications of such caption hallucinations on T2I generation performance remain under-explored. Through our empirical investigation, we first establish a comprehensive dataset comprising VLM-generated captions, and then systematically analyze how caption hallucination influences generation outcomes. Our findings reveal that (1) the disparities in caption quality persistently impact model outputs during fine-tuning. (2) VLMs confidence scores serve as reliable indicators for detecting and characterizing noise-related patterns in the data distribution. (3) even subtle variations in caption fidelity have significant effects on the quality of learned representations. These findings collectively emphasize the profound impact of caption quality on model performance and highlight the need for more sophisticated robust training algorithm in T2I. In response to these observations, we propose a approach leveraging VLM confidence score to mitigate caption noise, thereby enhancing the robustness of T2I models against hallucination in caption.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research in subject-driven generation increasingly emphasizes the importance of selective subject features. Nevertheless, accurately selecting the content in a given reference image still poses challenges, especially when selecting the similar subjects in an image (e.g., two different dogs). Some methods attempt to use text prompts or pixel masks to isolate specific elements. However, text prompts often fall short in precisely describing specific content, and pixel masks are often expensive. To address this, we introduce P3S-Diffusion, a novel architecture designed for context-selected subject-driven generation via point supervision. P3S-Diffusion leverages minimal cost label (e.g., points) to generate subject-driven images. During fine-tuning, it can generate an expanded base mask from these points, obviating the need for additional segmentation models. The mask is employed for inpainting and aligning with subject representation. The P3S-Diffusion preserves fine features of the subjects through Multi-layers Condition Injection. Enhanced by the Attention Consistency Loss for improved training, extensive experiments demonstrate its excellent feature preservation and image generation capabilities.</p>

Most of the existing methods are based on Transformers or diffusion models, however, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high inference time. RWKV, as an emerging deep sequence models, has shown immense potential for long-context sequence modeling in NLP tasks. In this work, we present a novel framework StyleRWKV, to achieve high-quality style transfer with limited memory usage and linear time complexity. Specifically, we propose a Recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism, which incorporates bidirectional attention to establish a global receptive field. Additionally, we develop a Deformable Shifting (Deform-Shifting) layer that introduces learnable offsets to the sampling grid of the convolution kernel, allowing tokens to shift flexibly and adaptively from the region of interest, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture local dependencies. Finally, we propose a Skip Scanning (S-Scanning) method that effectively establishes global contextual dependencies. Extensive experiments with analysis including qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of stylization quality, model complexity, and inference efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiqi Wu, Kaiqi Huang, Yuanqiang Cai, Shiyu Hu, Yuzhong Zhao, Weiqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Air-writing is a challenging task that combines the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, offering an intuitive and natural approach for human-computer interaction. However, current air-writing solutions face two primary challenges: (1) their dependency on complex sensors (e.g., Radar, EEGs and others) for capturing precise handwritten trajectories, and (2) the absence of a video-based air-writing dataset that covers a comprehensive vocabulary range. These limitations impede their practicality in various real-world scenarios, including the use on devices like iPhones and laptops. To tackle these challenges, we present the groundbreaking air-writing Chinese character video dataset (AWCV-100K-UCAS2024), serving as a pioneering benchmark for video-based air-writing. This dataset captures handwritten trajectories in various real-world scenarios using commonly accessible RGB cameras, eliminating the need for complex sensors. AWCV-100K-UCAS2024 includes 8.8 million video frames, encompassing the complete set of 3,755 characters from the GB2312-80 level-1 set (GB1). Furthermore, we introduce our baseline approach, the video-based character recognizer (VCRec). VCRec adeptly extracts fingertip features from sparse visual cues and employs a spatio-temporal sequence module for analysis. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of VCRec compared to existing models in recognizing air-written characters, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This breakthrough paves the way for enhanced human-computer interaction in real-world contexts. Moreover, our approach leverages affordable RGB cameras, enabling its applicability in a diverse range of scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Liu, Boran Wen, Xinpeng Liu, Zizheng Zhou, Hongwei Fan, Cewu Lu, Lizhuang Ma, Yulong Chen, Yong-Lu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal Human-Object Interaction (ST-HOI) understanding aims at detecting HOIs from videos, which is crucial for activity understanding. However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines. Data and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/HAKE-AVA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subeen Lee, Jiyeon Han, Soyeon Kim, Jaesik Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models are proficient in generating realistic data but struggle with producing rare samples in low density regions due to their scarcity of training datasets and the mode collapse problem. While recent methods aim to improve the fidelity of generated samples, they often reduce diversity and coverage by ignoring rare and novel samples. This study proposes a novel approach for generating diverse rare samples from high-resolution image datasets with pretrained GANs. Our method employs gradient-based optimization of latent vectors within a multi-objective framework and utilizes normalizing flows for density estimation on the feature space. This enables the generation of diverse rare images, with controllable parameters for rarity, diversity, and similarity to a reference image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively across various datasets and GANs without retraining or fine-tuning the pretrained GANs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanze Li, Chun-Mei Feng, Qilong Wang, Guanglei Yang, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Human beings can leverage knowledge from relative tasks to improve learning on a primary task. Similarly, multi-task learning methods suggest using auxiliary tasks to enhance a neural network's performance on a specific primary task. However, previous methods often select auxiliary tasks carefully but treat them as secondary during training. The weights assigned to auxiliary losses are typically smaller than the primary loss weight, leading to insufficient training on auxiliary tasks and ultimately failing to support the main task effectively. To address this issue, we propose an uncertainty-based impartial learning method that ensures balanced training across all tasks. Additionally, we consider both gradients and uncertainty information during backpropagation to further improve performance on the primary task. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our weighting strategy is effective and robust in enhancing the performance of the primary task regardless the noise auxiliary tasks' pseudo labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keke Zhang, Weiling Chen, Tiesong Zhao, Zhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) with references plays an important role in optimizing and evaluating computer vision tasks. Traditional methods assume that all pixels of the reference and test images are fully aligned. Such Aligned-Reference IQA (AR-IQA) approaches fail to address many real-world problems with various geometric deformations between the two images. Although significant effort has been made to attack Geometrically-Disparate-Reference IQA (GDR-IQA) problem, it has been addressed in a task-dependent fashion, for example, by dedicated designs for image super-resolution and retargeting, or by assuming the geometric distortions to be small that can be countered by translation-robust filters or by explicit image registrations. Here we rethink this problem and propose a unified, non-training-based Deep Structural Similarity (DeepSSIM) approach to address the above problems in a single framework, which assesses structural similarity of deep features in a simple but efficient way and uses an attention calibration strategy to alleviate attention deviation. The proposed method, without application-specific design, achieves state-of-the-art performance on AR-IQA datasets and meanwhile shows strong robustness to various GDR-IQA test cases. Interestingly, our test also shows the effectiveness of DeepSSIM as an optimization tool for training image super-resolution, enhancement and restoration, implying an even wider generalizability. \footnote{Source code will be made public after the review is completed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongbiao Gao, Xiangcheng Sun, Guohua Lv, Deng Yu, Sijiu Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to recognize audio and visual event labels with precise temporal boundaries, which is quite challenging since audio or visual modality might include only one event label with only the overall video labels available. Existing label denoising models often treat the denoising process as a separate preprocessing step, leading to a disconnect between label denoising and AVVP tasks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel joint reinforcement learning-based label denoising approach (RLLD). This approach enables simultaneous training of both label denoising and video parsing models through a joint optimization strategy. We introduce a novel AVVP-validation and soft inter-reward feedback mechanism that directly guides the learning of label denoising policy. Extensive experiments on AVVP tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to label denoising techniques. Furthermore, by incorporating our label denoising method into other AVVP models, we find that it can further enhance parsing results.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for scene decomposition and static background reconstruction from everyday videos. By integrating the trained motion masks and modeling the static scene as Gaussian splats with dynamics-aware optimization, our method achieves more accurate background reconstruction results than previous works. Our proposed method is termed DAS3R, an abbreviation for Dynamics-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Static Scene Reconstruction. Compared to existing methods, DAS3R is more robust in complex motion scenarios, capable of handling videos where dynamic objects occupy a significant portion of the scene, and does not require camera pose inputs or point cloud data from SLAM-based methods. We compared DAS3R against recent distractor-free approaches on the DAVIS and Sintel datasets; DAS3R demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness with a margin of more than 2 dB in PSNR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duy M. Le, Bao Q. Bui, Anh Tran, Cong Tran, Cuong Pham</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, which is a challenging task in computer vision, requires precise differentiation among visually similar object categories. In this paper, we propose 1) a novel module called Residual Relationship Attention (RRA) that leverages the relationships between images within each training batch to effectively integrate visual feature vectors of batch images and 2) a novel technique called Relationship Position Encoding (RPE), which encodes the positions of relationships between original images in a batch and effectively preserves the relationship information between images within the batch. Additionally, we design a novel framework, namely Relationship Batch Integration (RBI), which utilizes RRA in conjunction with RPE, allowing the discernment of vital visual features that may remain elusive when examining a singular image representative of a particular class. Through extensive experiments, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in the accuracy of different fine-grained classifiers, with an average increase of $(+2.78\%)$ and $(+3.83\%)$ on the CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dog datasets, respectively, while achieving a state-of-the-art results $(95.79\%)$ on the Stanford Dog dataset. Despite not achieving the same level of improvement as in fine-grained image classification, our method still demonstrates its prowess in leveraging general image classification by attaining a state-of-the-art result of $(93.71\%)$ on the Tiny-Imagenet dataset. Furthermore, our method serves as a plug-in refinement module and can be easily integrated into different networks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19628">RecConv: Efficient Recursive Convolutions for Multi-Frequency Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingshu Zhao, Yi Luo, Yong Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the advantage of global modeling capabilities, prompting widespread integration of large-kernel convolutions for enlarging the effective receptive field (ERF). However, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity (FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and optimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive decomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency representations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear relationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines the effective kernel size $k\times 2^\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\ell$ levels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF expansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only $\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the exponential growth ($4^\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions. RecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar FLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient and compact networks across various modalities. Codes and models can be found at \url{https://github.com/suous/RecNeXt}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaomin Li, Yixuan Liu, Takashi Isobe, Xu Jia, Qinpeng Cui, Dong Zhou, Dong Li, You He, Huchuan Lu, Zhongdao Wang, Emad Barsoum</p>
<p>Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation applications, negative embeddings have proven to be a simple yet effective approach for enhancing generation quality. Typically, these negative embeddings are derived from user-defined negative prompts, which, while being functional, are not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we introduce ReNeg, an end-to-end method designed to learn improved Negative embeddings guided by a Reward model. We employ a reward feedback learning framework and integrate classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training process, which was previously utilized only during inference, thus enabling the effective learning of negative embeddings. We also propose two strategies for learning both global and per-sample negative embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the learned negative embedding significantly outperforms null-text and handcrafted counterparts, achieving substantial improvements in human preference alignment. Additionally, the negative embedding learned within the same text embedding space exhibits strong generalization capabilities. For example, using the same CLIP text encoder, the negative embedding learned on SD1.5 can be seamlessly transferred to text-to-image or even text-to-video models such as ControlNet, ZeroScope, and VideoCrafter2, resulting in consistent performance improvements across the board.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wu, Yong Zhang, Xiaodong Cun, Zhongang Qi, Junfu Pu, Huanzhang Dou, Guangcong Zheng, Ying Shan, Xi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot customized video generation has gained significant attention due to its substantial application potential. Existing methods rely on additional models to extract and inject reference subject features, assuming that the Video Diffusion Model (VDM) alone is insufficient for zero-shot customized video generation. However, these methods often struggle to maintain consistent subject appearance due to suboptimal feature extraction and injection techniques. In this paper, we reveal that VDM inherently possesses the force to extract and inject subject features. Departing from previous heuristic approaches, we introduce a novel framework that leverages VDM's inherent force to enable high-quality zero-shot customized video generation. Specifically, for feature extraction, we directly input reference images into VDM and use its intrinsic feature extraction process, which not only provides fine-grained features but also significantly aligns with VDM's pre-trained knowledge. For feature injection, we devise an innovative bidirectional interaction between subject features and generated content through spatial self-attention within VDM, ensuring that VDM has better subject fidelity while maintaining the diversity of the generated video.Experiments on both customized human and object video generation validate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking (VLT) aims to localize a target in video sequences using a visual template and language description. While textual cues enhance tracking potential, current datasets typically contain much more image data than text, limiting the ability of VLT methods to align the two modalities effectively. To address this imbalance, we propose a novel plug-and-play method named CTVLT that leverages the strong text-image alignment capabilities of foundation grounding models. CTVLT converts textual cues into interpretable visual heatmaps, which are easier for trackers to process. Specifically, we design a textual cue mapping module that transforms textual cues into target distribution heatmaps, visually representing the location described by the text. Additionally, the heatmap guidance module fuses these heatmaps with the search image to guide tracking more effectively. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating the utility of our method for enhanced VLT.</p>

<p>Abstract: The application of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) research powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. Existing methods attempt to optimize input text prompts for improved alignment of images and text, by finely adjusting text prototypes to facilitate semantic matching. Nevertheless, given the modality gap between text and vision spaces, the text prototypes employed by these methods have not effectively established a close correspondence with pixel-level vision features. In this work, our theoretical analysis indicates that the inherent modality gap results in misalignment of text and region features, and that this gap cannot be sufficiently reduced by minimizing contrast loss in CLIP. To mitigate the impact of the modality gap, we propose a Vision Prototype Learning (VPL) framework, by introducing more representative vision prototypes. The core of this framework is to learn class-specific vision prototypes in vision space with the help of text prototypes, for capturing high-quality localization maps. Moreover, we propose a regional semantic contrast module that contrasts regions embedding with corresponding prototypes, leading to more comprehensive and robust feature learning. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangsheng Xu, Guoyi Zhang, Lejia Ye, Shuwei Gan, Xiaohu Zhang, Xia Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently achieved significant success in 3D human pose estimation, owing to their strong ability to model long-range dependencies. However, relying solely on the global attention mechanism is insufficient for capturing the fine-grained local details, which are crucial for accurate pose estimation. To address this, we propose SSR-STF, a dual-stream model that effectively integrates local features with global dependencies to enhance 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, we introduce SSRFormer, a simple yet effective module that employs the skeleton selective refine attention (SSRA) mechanism to capture fine-grained local dependencies in human pose sequences, complementing the global dependencies modeled by the Transformer. By adaptively fusing these two feature streams, SSR-STF can better learn the underlying structure of human poses, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in local feature extraction. Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that SSR-STF achieves state-of-the-art performance, with P1 errors of 37.4 mm and 13.2 mm respectively, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, the motion representations learned by our model prove effective in downstream tasks such as human mesh recovery. Codes are available at https://github.com/poker-xu/SSR-STF.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, several image-processing methods and algorithms have been proposed for identifying plant diseases based on visual data. DNN (Deep Neural Networks) have recently become popular for this task. Both traditional image processing and DNN-based methods encounter significant performance issues in real-time detection owing to computational limitations and a broad spectrum of plant disease features. This article proposes a novel technique for identifying and localising plant disease based on the Quad-Tree decomposition of an image and feature learning simultaneously. The proposed algorithm significantly improves accuracy and faster convergence in high-resolution images with relatively low computational load. Hence it is ideal for deploying the algorithm in a standalone processor in a remotely operated image acquisition and disease detection system, ideally mounted on drones and robots working on large agricultural fields. The technique proposed in this article is hybrid as it exploits the advantages of traditional image processing methods and DNN-based models at different scales, resulting in faster inference. The F1 score is approximately 0.80 for four disease classes corresponding to potato and tomato crops.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingchun Lian, Lingyu Liu, Yaxiong Wang, Yujiao Wu, Li Zhu, Zhedong Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Image forgery localization, which centers on identifying tampered pixels within an image, has seen significant advancements. Traditional approaches often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations. To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset, code as well as pretrained checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19712">From Elements to Design: A Layered Approach for Automatic Graphic Design Composition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Lin, Shizhao Sun, Danqing Huang, Ting Liu, Ji Li, Jiang Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate automatic design composition from multimodal graphic elements. Although recent studies have developed various generative models for graphic design, they usually face the following limitations: they only focus on certain subtasks and are far from achieving the design composition task; they do not consider the hierarchical information of graphic designs during the generation process. To tackle these issues, we introduce the layered design principle into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and propose a novel approach, called LaDeCo, to accomplish this challenging task. Specifically, LaDeCo first performs layer planning for a given element set, dividing the input elements into different semantic layers according to their contents. Based on the planning results, it subsequently predicts element attributes that control the design composition in a layer-wise manner, and includes the rendered image of previously generated layers into the context. With this insightful design, LaDeCo decomposes the difficult task into smaller manageable steps, making the generation process smoother and clearer. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaDeCo in design composition. Furthermore, we show that LaDeCo enables some interesting applications in graphic design, such as resolution adjustment, element filling, design variation, etc. In addition, it even outperforms the specialized models in some design subtasks without any task-specific training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Chen, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) are vital implicit representations to represent high fidelity 3D surfaces. Current methods mainly leverage a neural network to learn an SDF from various supervisions including signed distances, 3D point clouds, or multi-view images. However, due to various reasons including the bias of neural network on low frequency content, 3D unaware sampling, sparsity in point clouds, or low resolutions of images, neural implicit representations still struggle to represent geometries with high frequency components like sharp structures, especially for the ones learned from images or point clouds. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a method to sharpen a low frequency SDF observation by recovering its high frequency components, pursuing a sharper and more complete surface. Our key idea is to learn a mapping from a low frequency observation to a full frequency coverage in a data-driven manner, leading to a prior knowledge of shape consolidation in the frequency domain, dubbed frequency consolidation priors. To better generalize a learned prior to unseen shapes, we introduce to represent frequency components as embeddings and disentangle the embedding of the low frequency component from the embedding of the full frequency component. This disentanglement allows the prior to generalize on an unseen low frequency observation by simply recovering its full frequency embedding through a test-time self-reconstruction. Our evaluations under widely used benchmarks or real scenes show that our method can recover high frequency component and produce more accurate surfaces than the latest methods.

<p>Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have the inherent ability to realistically model natural scenes. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a careful design of a generative video propagation framework, various video tasks can be addressed in a unified way by leveraging the generative power of such models. Specifically, our framework, GenProp, encodes the original video with a selective content encoder and propagates the changes made to the first frame using an image-to-video generation model. We propose a data generation scheme to cover multiple video tasks based on instance-level video segmentation datasets. Our model is trained by incorporating a mask prediction decoder head and optimizing a region-aware loss to aid the encoder to preserve the original content while the generation model propagates the modified region. This novel design opens up new possibilities: In editing scenarios, GenProp allows substantial changes to an object's shape; for insertion, the inserted objects can exhibit independent motion; for removal, GenProp effectively removes effects like shadows and reflections from the whole video; for tracking, GenProp is capable of tracking objects and their associated effects together. Experiment results demonstrate the leading performance of our model in various video tasks, and we further provide in-depth analyses of the proposed framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in complex video understanding tasks. However, their robustness to real-world manipulations remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MVTamperBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLM's resilience to video tampering effects, including rotation, dropping, masking, substitution, and repetition. By systematically assessing state-of-the-art models, MVTamperBench reveals substantial variability in robustness, with models like InternVL2-8B achieving high performance, while others, such as Llama-VILA1.5-8B, exhibit severe vulnerabilities. To foster broader adoption and reproducibility, MVTamperBench is integrated into VLMEvalKit, a modular evaluation toolkit, enabling streamlined testing and facilitating advancements in model robustness. Our benchmark represents a critical step towards developing tamper-resilient VLMs, ensuring their dependability in real-world scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer plenty of challenges in executing efficient computation at edge nodes, primarily due to the huge hardware resource demands. The article proposes HYDRA, hybrid data multiplexing, and runtime layer configurable DNN accelerators to overcome the drawbacks. The work proposes a layer-multiplexed approach, which further reuses a single activation function within the execution of a single layer with improved Fused-Multiply-Accumulate (FMA). The proposed approach works in iterative mode to reuse the same hardware and execute different layers in a configurable fashion. The proposed architectures achieve reductions over 90% of power consumption and resource utilization improvements of state-of-the-art works, with 35.21 TOPSW. The proposed architecture reduces the area overhead (N-1) times required in bandwidth, AF and layer architecture. This work shows HYDRA architecture supports optimal DNN computations while improving performance on resource-constrained edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Ullman</p>
<p>Abstract: Illusions are entertaining, but they are also a useful diagnostic tool in cognitive science, philosophy, and neuroscience. A typical illusion shows a gap between how something "really is" and how something "appears to be", and this gap helps us understand the mental processing that lead to how something appears to be. Illusions are also useful for investigating artificial systems, and much research has examined whether computational models of perceptions fall prey to the same illusions as people. Here, I invert the standard use of perceptual illusions to examine basic processing errors in current vision language models. I present these models with illusory-illusions, neighbors of common illusions that should not elicit processing errors. These include such things as perfectly reasonable ducks, crooked lines that truly are crooked, circles that seem to have different sizes because they are, in fact, of different sizes, and so on. I show that many current vision language systems mistakenly see these illusion-illusions as illusions. I suggest that such failures are part of broader failures already discussed in the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning methods are highly effective for many image reconstruction tasks. However, the performance of supervised learned models can degrade when applied to distinct experimental settings at test time or in the presence of distribution shifts. In this study, we demonstrate that pruning deep image reconstruction networks at training time can improve their robustness to distribution shifts. In particular, we consider unrolled reconstruction architectures for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging and introduce a method for pruning unrolled networks (PUN) at initialization. Our experiments demonstrate that when compared to traditional dense networks, PUN offers improved generalization across a variety of experimental settings and even slight performance gains on in-distribution data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arya Bangun, Zhuo Cao, Alessio Quercia, Hanno Scharr, Elisabeth Pfaehler</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging technique widely used for visualizing structures within the human body and in other fields such as plant sciences. However, there is a demand to develop fast 3D-MRI reconstruction algorithms to show the fine structure of objects from under-sampled acquisition data, i.e., k-space data. This emphasizes the need for efficient solutions that can handle limited input while maintaining high-quality imaging. In contrast to previous methods only using 2D, we propose a 3D MRI reconstruction method that leverages a regularized 3D diffusion model combined with optimization method. By incorporating diffusion based priors, our method improves image quality, reduces noise, and enhances the overall fidelity of 3D MRI reconstructions. We conduct comprehensive experiments analysis on clinical and plant science MRI datasets. To evaluate the algorithm effectiveness for under-sampled k-space data, we also demonstrate its reconstruction performance with several undersampling patterns, as well as with in- and out-of-distribution pre-trained data. In experiments, we show that our method improves upon tested competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gustaf Ahdritz, Aravind Gollakota, Parikshit Gopalan, Charlotte Peale, Udi Wieder</p>
<p>Abstract: We give a principled method for decomposing the predictive uncertainty of a model into aleatoric and epistemic components with explicit semantics relating them to the real-world data distribution. While many works in the literature have proposed such decompositions, they lack the type of formal guarantees we provide. Our method is based on the new notion of higher-order calibration, which generalizes ordinary calibration to the setting of higher-order predictors that predict mixtures over label distributions at every point. We show how to measure as well as achieve higher-order calibration using access to $k$-snapshots, namely examples where each point has $k$ independent conditional labels. Under higher-order calibration, the estimated aleatoric uncertainty at a point is guaranteed to match the real-world aleatoric uncertainty averaged over all points where the prediction is made. To our knowledge, this is the first formal guarantee of this type that places no assumptions whatsoever on the real-world data distribution. Importantly, higher-order calibration is also applicable to existing higher-order predictors such as Bayesian and ensemble models and provides a natural evaluation metric for such models. We demonstrate through experiments that our method produces meaningful uncertainty decompositions for image classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Gu, Hao Chen, Ming Lu, Jie Yao, Zhan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep video compression has made significant progress in recent years, achieving rate-distortion performance that surpasses that of traditional video compression methods. However, rate control schemes tailored for deep video compression have not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based $\lambda$-domain rate control scheme for deep video compression, which determines the coding parameter $\lambda$ for each to-be-coded frame based on the rate-distortion-$\lambda$ (R-D-$\lambda$) relationships directly learned from uncompressed frames, achieving high rate control accuracy efficiently without the need for pre-encoding. Moreover, this content-aware scheme is able to mitigate inter-frame quality fluctuations and adapt to abrupt changes in video content. Specifically, we introduce two neural network-based predictors to estimate the relationship between bitrate and $\lambda$, as well as the relationship between distortion and $\lambda$ for each frame. Then we determine the coding parameter $\lambda$ for each frame to achieve the target bitrate. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high rate control accuracy at the mini-GOP level with low time overhead and mitigates inter-frame quality fluctuations across video content of varying resolutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Ren, Zhengyu Zhao, Chenhao Lin, Bo Yang, Lu Zhou, Zhe Liu, Chao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Transferable adversarial examples are known to cause threats in practical, black-box attack scenarios. A notable approach to improving transferability is using integrated gradients (IG), originally developed for model interpretability. In this paper, we find that existing IG-based attacks have limited transferability due to their naive adoption of IG in model interpretability. To address this limitation, we focus on the IG integration path and refine it in three aspects: multiplicity, monotonicity, and diversity, supported by theoretical analyses. We propose the Multiple Monotonic Diversified Integrated Gradients (MuMoDIG) attack, which can generate highly transferable adversarial examples on different CNN and ViT models and defenses. Experiments validate that MuMoDIG outperforms the latest IG-based attack by up to 37.3\% and other state-of-the-art attacks by 8.4\%. In general, our study reveals that migrating established techniques to improve transferability may require non-trivial efforts. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/RYC-98/MuMoDIG}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lumbar disk segmentation is essential for diagnosing and curing spinal disorders by enabling precise detection of disk boundaries in medical imaging. The advent of deep learning has resulted in the development of many segmentation methods, offering differing levels of accuracy and effectiveness. This study assesses the effectiveness of several sophisticated deep learning architectures, including ResUnext, Ef3 Net, UNet, and TransUNet, for lumbar disk segmentation, highlighting key metrics like as Pixel Accuracy, Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU), and Dice Coefficient. The findings indicate that ResUnext achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, with a Pixel Accuracy of 0.9492 and a Dice Coefficient of 0.8425, with TransUNet following closely after. Filtering techniques somewhat enhanced the performance of most models, particularly Dense UNet, improving stability and segmentation quality. The findings underscore the efficacy of these models in lumbar disk segmentation and highlight potential areas for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carl Qi, Dan Haramati, Tal Daniel, Aviv Tamar, Amy Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Object manipulation is a common component of everyday tasks, but learning to manipulate objects from high-dimensional observations presents significant challenges. These challenges are heightened in multi-object environments due to the combinatorial complexity of the state space as well as of the desired behaviors. While recent approaches have utilized large-scale offline data to train models from pixel observations, achieving performance gains through scaling, these methods struggle with compositional generalization in unseen object configurations with constrained network and dataset sizes. To address these issues, we propose a novel behavioral cloning (BC) approach that leverages object-centric representations and an entity-centric Transformer with diffusion-based optimization, enabling efficient learning from offline image data. Our method first decomposes observations into an object-centric representation, which is then processed by our entity-centric Transformer that computes attention at the object level, simultaneously predicting object dynamics and the agent's actions. Combined with the ability of diffusion models to capture multi-modal behavior distributions, this results in substantial performance improvements in multi-object tasks and, more importantly, enables compositional generalization. We present BC agents capable of zero-shot generalization to tasks with novel compositions of objects and goals, including larger numbers of objects than seen during training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Zou, Evelyn Zhang, Runlin Guo, Haohang Xu, Conghui He, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However, on the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous timesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand, conservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but still computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation quality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a tradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper begins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features. Surprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly more caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching can fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual caching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively, leading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same time. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise conservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no training and calibration data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Shi, Liangxiu Han, Darren Dancy, Lianghao Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have recently achieved significant advancements in remote sensing superresolu-tion (SR). However, most existing methods are limited to low magnification rates (e.g., 2 or 4) due to the escalating ill-posedness at higher magnification scales. To tackle this challenge, we redefine high-magnification SR as the ultra-resolution (UR) problem, reframing it as solving a conditional diffusion stochastic differential equation (SDE). In this context, we propose WaveDiffUR, a novel wavelet-domain diffusion UR solver that decomposes the UR process into sequential sub-processes addressing conditional wavelet components. WaveDiffUR iteratively reconstructs low-frequency wavelet details (ensuring global consistency) and high-frequency components (enhancing local fidelity) by incorporating pre-trained SR models as plug-and-play modules. This modularity mitigates the ill-posedness of the SDE and ensures scalability across diverse applications. To address limitations in fixed boundary conditions at extreme magnifications, we introduce the cross-scale pyramid (CSP) constraint, a dynamic and adaptive framework that guides WaveDiffUR in generating fine-grained wavelet details, ensuring consistent and high-fidelity outputs even at extreme magnification rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Brain aging is a complex and dynamic process, leading to functional and structural changes in the brain. These changes could lead to the increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. Accurate brain-age estimation utilizing neuroimaging data has become necessary for detecting initial signs of neurodegeneration. Here, we propose a novel deep learning approach using the Residual Neural Network 101 Version 2 (ResNet101V2) model to predict brain age from MRI scans. To train, validate and test our proposed model, we used a large dataset of 2102 images which were selected randomly from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM). Next, we applied data preprocessing techniques, including normalizing the images and using outlier detection via Isolation Forest method. Then, we evaluated various pre-trained approaches (namely: MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, Xception). The results demonstrated that the ResNet101V2 model has higher performance compared with the other models, attaining MAEs of 0.9136 and 0.8242 years for before and after using Isolation Forest process. Our method achieved a high accuracy in brain age estimation in ICBM dataset and it provides a reliable brain age prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of deep learning in medical imaging has shown great promise for enhancing diagnostic, therapeutic, and research outcomes. However, applying universal models across multiple modalities remains challenging due to the inherent variability in data characteristics. This study aims to introduce and evaluate a Modality Projection Universal Model (MPUM). MPUM employs a novel modality-projection strategy, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its parameters to optimize performance across different imaging modalities. The MPUM demonstrated superior accuracy in identifying anatomical structures, enabling precise quantification for improved clinical decision-making. It also identifies metabolic associations within the brain-body axis, advancing research on brain-body physiological correlations. Furthermore, MPUM's unique controller-based convolution layer enables visualization of saliency maps across all network layers, significantly enhancing the model's interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Motonari Kambara, Komei Sugiura</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses a task designed to predict the future success or failure of open-vocabulary object manipulation. In this task, the model is required to make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions. We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1 dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks, to evaluate our method. The experimental results show that our method achieved a higher prediction accuracy than baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rodrigo Moreira, Hugo G. V. O. da Cunha, Larissa F. Rodrigues Moreira, Fl\'avio de Oliveira Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring heterogeneous infrastructures and applications is essential to cope with user requirements properly, but it still lacks enhancements. The well-known state-of-the-art methods and tools do not support seamless monitoring of bare-metal, low-cost infrastructures, neither hosted nor virtualized services with fine-grained details. This work proposes VIrtualized NEtwork VIsion architecture (VINEVI), an intelligent method for seamless monitoring heterogeneous infrastructures and applications. The VINEVI architecture advances state of the art with a node-embedded traffic classification agent placing physical and virtualized infrastructures enabling real-time traffic classification. VINEVI combines this real-time traffic classification with well-known tools such as Prometheus and Victoria Metrics to monitor the entire stack from the hardware to the virtualized applications. Experimental results showcased that VINEVI architecture allowed seamless heterogeneous infrastructure monitoring with a higher level of detail beyond literature. Also, our node-embedded real-time Internet traffic classifier evolved with flexibility the methods with monitoring heterogeneous infrastructures seamlessly.</p>

<p>Abstract: The network traffic classification allows improving the management, and the network services offer taking into account the kind of application. The future network architectures, mainly mobile networks, foresee intelligent mechanisms in their architectural frameworks to deliver application-aware network requirements. The potential of convolutional neural networks capabilities, widely exploited in several contexts, can be used in network traffic classification. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods based on the content of packets transforming it into a suitable input for CNN technologies. Hence, we implemented and evaluated the Packet Vision, a method capable of building images from packets raw-data, considering both header and payload. Our approach excels those found in state-of-the-art by delivering security and privacy by transforming the raw-data packet into images. Therefore, we built a dataset with four traffic classes evaluating the performance of three CNNs architectures: AlexNet, ResNet-18, and SqueezeNet. Experiments showcase the Packet Vision combined with CNNs applicability and suitability as a promising approach to deliver outstanding performance in classifying network traffic.</p>

<p>Abstract: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly spread globally, impacting the lives of billions of people. The effective screening of infected patients is a critical step to struggle with COVID-19, and treating the patients avoiding this quickly disease spread. The need for automated and scalable methods has increased due to the unavailability of accurate automated toolkits. Recent researches using chest X-ray images suggest they include relevant information about the COVID-19 virus. Hence, applying machine learning techniques combined with radiological imaging promises to identify this disease accurately. It is straightforward to collect these images once it is spreadly shared and analyzed in the world. This paper presents a method for automatic COVID-19 detection using chest Xray images through four convolutional neural networks, namely: AlexNet, VGG-11, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121. This method had been providing accurate diagnostics for positive or negative COVID-19 classification. We validate our experiments using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure over the training and test sets. Our findings include the shallow fine-tuning and data augmentation strategies that can assist in dealing with the low number of positive COVID-19 images publicly available. The accuracy for all CNNs is higher than 97.00%, and the SqueezeNet model achieved the best result with 99.20%.</p>

<p>Abstract: The interpretability of deep neural networks is crucial for understanding model decisions in various applications, including computer vision. AttEXplore++, an advanced framework built upon AttEXplore, enhances attribution by incorporating transferable adversarial attack methods such as MIG and GRA, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of model explanations. We conduct extensive experiments on five models, including CNNs (Inception-v3, ResNet-50, VGG16) and vision transformers (MaxViT-T, ViT-B/16), using the ImageNet dataset. Our method achieves an average performance improvement of 7.57\% over AttEXplore and 32.62\% compared to other state-of-the-art interpretability algorithms. Using insertion and deletion scores as evaluation metrics, we show that adversarial transferability plays a vital role in enhancing attribution results. Furthermore, we explore the impact of randomness, perturbation rate, noise amplitude, and diversity probability on attribution performance, demonstrating that AttEXplore++ provides more stable and reliable explanations across various models.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a scanner package enhanced by deep learning (DL) techniques. The proposed package addresses two significant challenges associated with previously developed DL-based methods: slow convergence in high-dimensional scans and the limited generalization of the DL network when mapping random points to the target space. To tackle the first issue, we utilize a similarity learning network that maps sampled points into a representation space. In this space, in-target points are grouped together while out-target points are effectively pushed apart. This approach enhances the scan convergence by refining the representation of sampled points. The second challenge is mitigated by integrating a dynamic sampling strategy. Specifically, we employ a VEGAS mapping to adaptively suggest new points for the DL network while also improving the mapping when more points are collected. Our proposed framework demonstrates substantial gains in both performance and efficiency compared to other scanning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jana Zakall, Birgit Pohn, Antonia Graf, Daniel Kovatchki, Arezoo Borji, Ragib Shahriar Islam, Hossam Haick, Heinz Strohmer, Sepideh Hatamikia</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance decision-making and optimize treatment protocols in in vitro fertilization (IVF). In particular, AI shows significant promise in supporting decision-making during the ovarian stimulation phase of the IVF process. This review evaluates studies focused on the applications of AI combined with medical imaging in ovarian stimulation, examining methodologies, outcomes, and current limitations. Our analysis of 13 studies on this topic reveals that, reveal that while AI algorithms demonstrated notable potential in predicting optimal hormonal dosages, trigger timing, and oocyte retrieval outcomes, the medical imaging data utilized predominantly came from two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound which mainly involved basic quantifications, such as follicle size and number, with limited use of direct feature extraction or advanced image analysis techniques. This points to an underexplored opportunity where advanced image analysis approaches, such as deep learning, and more diverse imaging modalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper insights. Additionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises concerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions - key factors for clinical adoption and trust. Furthermore, many studies relied on single-center designs and small datasets, which limit the generalizability of their findings. This review highlights the need for integrating advanced imaging analysis techniques with explainable AI methodologies, as well as the importance of leveraging multicenter collaborations and larger datasets. Addressing these gaps has the potential to enhance ovarian stimulation management, paving the way for efficient, personalized, and data-driven treatment pathways that improve IVF outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhavesh Gyanchandani, Aditya Oza, Abhinav Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing need for accurate and efficient 3D identification of tumors, particularly in liver segmentation, has spurred considerable research into deep learning models. While many existing architectures offer strong performance, they often face challenges such as overfitting and excessive computational costs. An adjustable and flexible architecture that strikes a balance between time efficiency and model complexity remains an unmet requirement. In this paper, we introduce proKAN, a progressive stacking methodology for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional architectures, proKAN dynamically adjusts its complexity by progressively adding KAN blocks during training, based on overfitting behavior. This approach allows the network to stop growing when overfitting is detected, preventing unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, proKAN utilizes KAN's learnable activation functions modeled through B-splines, which provide enhanced flexibility in learning complex relationships in 3D medical data. Our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in liver segmentation tasks, outperforming standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and fixed KAN architectures. The dynamic nature of proKAN ensures efficient training times and high accuracy without the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, proKAN provides better interpretability by allowing insight into the decision-making process through its learnable coefficients. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, Dice score, and time efficiency, making proKAN a compelling solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaxiong Wang, Yunchao Wei, Yujiao Wu, Xueming Qian, Li Zhu, Yi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Superpixel segmentation has seen significant progress benefiting from the deep convolutional networks. The typical approach entails initial division of the image into grids, followed by a learning process that assigns each pixel to adjacent grid segments. However, reliance on convolutions with confined receptive fields results in an implicit, rather than explicit, understanding of pixel-grid interactions. This limitation often leads to a deficit of contextual information during the mapping of associations. To counteract this, we introduce the Association Implantation (AI) module, designed to allow networks to explicitly engage with pixel-grid relationships. This module embeds grid features directly into the vicinity of the central pixel and employs convolutional operations on an enlarged window, facilitating an adaptive transfer of knowledge. This approach enables the network to explicitly extract context at the pixel-grid level, which is more aligned with the objectives of superpixel segmentation than mere pixel-wise interactions. By integrating the AI module across various layers, we enable a progressive refinement of pixel-superpixel relationships from coarse to fine. To further enhance the assignment of boundary pixels, we've engineered a boundary-aware loss function. This function aids in the discrimination of boundary-adjacent pixels at the feature level, thereby empowering subsequent modules to precisely identify boundary pixels and enhance overall boundary accuracy. Our method has been rigorously tested on four benchmarks, including BSDS500, NYUv2, ACDC, and ISIC2017, and our model can achieve competitive performance with comparison methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Hyeon-Woo, Kim Yu-Ji, Byeongho Heo, Dongyoon Han, Seong Joon Oh, Tae-Hyun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: The favorable performance of Vision Transformers (ViTs) is often attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA). The MSA enables global interactions at each layer of a ViT model, which is a contrasting feature against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that gradually increase the range of interaction across multiple layers. We study the role of the density of the attention. Our preliminary analyses suggest that the spatial interactions of attention maps are close to dense interactions rather than sparse ones. This is a curious phenomenon, as dense attention maps are harder for the model to learn due to steeper softmax gradients around them. We interpret this as a strong preference for ViT models to include dense interaction. We thus manually insert the uniform attention to each layer of ViT models to supply the much needed dense interactions. We call this method Context Broadcasting, CB. We observe that the inclusion of CB reduces the degree of density in the original attention maps and increases both the capacity and generalizability of the ViT models. CB incurs negligible costs: 1 line in your model code, no additional parameters, and minimal extra operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingchen Li, Jun Xiao, Guikun Chen, Yinfu Feng, Yi Yang, An-an Liu, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's scene graph generation (SGG) models typically require abundant manual annotations to learn new predicate types. Therefore, it is difficult to apply them to real-world applications with massive uncommon predicate categories whose annotations are hard to collect. In this paper, we focus on Few-Shot SGG (FSSGG), which encourages SGG models to be able to quickly transfer previous knowledge and recognize unseen predicates well with only a few examples. However, current methods for FSSGG are hindered by the high intra-class variance of predicate categories in SGG: On one hand, each predicate category commonly has multiple semantic meanings under different contexts. On the other hand, the visual appearance of relation triplets with the same predicate differs greatly under different subject-object compositions. Such great variance of inputs makes it hard to learn generalizable representation for each predicate category with current few-shot learning (FSL) methods. However, we found that this intra-class variance of predicates is highly related to the composed subjects and objects. To model the intra-class variance of predicates with subject-object context, we propose a novel Decomposed Prototype Learning (DPL) model for FSSGG. Specifically, we first construct a decomposable prototype space to capture diverse semantics and visual patterns of subjects and objects for predicates by decomposing them into multiple prototypes. Afterwards, we integrate these prototypes with different weights to generate query-adaptive predicate representation with more reliable semantics for each query sample. We conduct extensive experiments and compare with various baseline methods to show the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijia Chen, Baochun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) tasks involve explicit cross-modal alignment, as semantically corresponding image regions are to be located for the language phrases provided. Existing approaches complete such visual-text reasoning in a single-step manner. Their performance causes high demands on large-scale anchors and over-designed multi-modal fusion modules based on human priors, leading to complicated frameworks that may be difficult to train and overfit to specific scenarios. Even worse, such once-for-all reasoning mechanisms are incapable of refining boxes continuously to enhance query-region matching. In contrast, in this paper, we formulate an iterative reasoning process by denoising diffusion modeling. Specifically, we propose a language-guided diffusion framework for visual grounding, LG-DVG, which trains the model to progressively reason queried object boxes by denoising a set of noisy boxes with the language guide. To achieve this, LG-DVG gradually perturbs query-aligned ground truth boxes to noisy ones and reverses this process step by step, conditional on query semantics. Extensive experiments for our proposed framework on five widely used datasets validate the superior performance of solving visual grounding, a cross-modal alignment task, in a generative way.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hila Levi, Guy Heller, Dan Levi, Ethan Fetaya</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of open-vocabulary object-centric image retrieval involves the retrieval of images containing a specified object of interest, delineated by an open-set text query. As working on large image datasets becomes standard, solving this task efficiently has gained significant practical importance. Applications include targeted performance analysis of retrieved images using ad-hoc queries and hard example mining during training. Recent advancements in contrastive-based open vocabulary systems have yielded remarkable breakthroughs, facilitating large-scale open vocabulary image retrieval. However, these approaches use a single global embedding per image, thereby constraining the system's ability to retrieve images containing relatively small object instances. Alternatively, incorporating local embeddings from detection pipelines faces scalability challenges, making it unsuitable for retrieval from large databases.
  In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach to object-centric open-vocabulary image retrieval. Our approach aggregates dense embeddings extracted from CLIP into a compact representation, essentially combining the scalability of image retrieval pipelines with the object identification capabilities of dense detection methods. We show the effectiveness of our scheme to the task by achieving significantly better results than global feature approaches on three datasets, increasing accuracy by up to 15 mAP points. We further integrate our scheme into a large scale retrieval framework and demonstrate our method's advantages in terms of scalability and interpretability.</p>

In this paper, we introduce CogAgent, an 18-billion-parameter visual language model (VLM) specializing in GUI understanding and navigation. By utilizing both low-resolution and high-resolution image encoders, CogAgent supports input at a resolution of 1120*1120, enabling it to recognize tiny page elements and text. As a generalist visual language model, CogAgent achieves the state of the art on five text-rich and four general VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, OK-VQA, Text-VQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, infoVQA, DocVQA, MM-Vet, and POPE.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingxuan Huang, Jiacheng Miao, Shizhuo Deng,  Tong, Dongyue Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth completion is a critical task for handling depth images with missing pixels, which can negatively impact further applications. Recent approaches have utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to reconstruct depth images with the assistance of color images. However, vanilla convolution has non-negligible drawbacks in handling missing pixels. To solve this problem, we propose a new model for depth completion based on an encoder-decoder structure. Our model introduces two key components: the Mask-adaptive Gated Convolution (MagaConv) architecture and the Bi-directional Progressive Fusion (BP-Fusion) module. The MagaConv architecture is designed to acquire precise depth features by modulating convolution operations with iteratively updated masks, while the BP-Fusion module progressively integrates depth and color features, utilizing consecutive bi-directional fusion structures in a global perspective. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, including NYU-Depth V2, DIML, and SUN RGB-D, demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. We achieved remarkable performance in completing depth maps and outperformed existing approaches in terms of accuracy and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce PhotoBot, a framework for fully automated photo acquisition based on an interplay between high-level human language guidance and a robot photographer. We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via reference images that are selected from a curated gallery. We leverage a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize the reference images via textual descriptions and then use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference images based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference image and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across marked appearance variations. Using these features, we compute suggested pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach using a manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBot are often more aesthetically pleasing than those taken by users themselves, as measured by human feedback.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Holistic and Multi-Granular Surgical Scene Understanding of Prostatectomies (GraSP) dataset, a curated benchmark that models surgical scene understanding as a hierarchy of complementary tasks with varying levels of granularity. Our approach encompasses long-term tasks, such as surgical phase and step recognition, and short-term tasks, including surgical instrument segmentation and atomic visual actions detection. To exploit our proposed benchmark, we introduce the Transformers for Actions, Phases, Steps, and Instrument Segmentation (TAPIS) model, a general architecture that combines a global video feature extractor with localized region proposals from an instrument segmentation model to tackle the multi-granularity of our benchmark. Through extensive experimentation in ours and alternative benchmarks, we demonstrate TAPIS's versatility and state-of-the-art performance across different tasks. This work represents a foundational step forward in Endoscopic Vision, offering a novel framework for future research towards holistic surgical scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Dai, Yafei Ou, Yuqiao Yang, Yang Liu, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate tooth identification and segmentation in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) dental images can significantly enhance the efficiency and precision of manual diagnoses performed by dentists. However, existing segmentation methods are mainly developed based on large data volumes training, on which their annotations are extremely time-consuming. Meanwhile, the teeth of each class in CBCT dental images being closely positioned, coupled with subtle inter-class differences, gives rise to the challenge of indistinct boundaries when training model with limited data. To address these challenges, this study aims to propose a tasked-oriented Masked Auto-Encoder paradigm to effectively utilize large amounts of unlabeled data to achieve accurate tooth segmentation with limited labeled data. Specifically, we first construct a self-supervised pre-training framework of masked auto encoder to efficiently utilize unlabeled data to enhance the network performance. Subsequently, we introduce a sparse masked prompt mechanism based on graph attention to incorporate boundary information of the teeth, aiding the network in learning the anatomical structural features of teeth. To the best of our knowledge, we are pioneering the integration of the mask pre-training paradigm into the CBCT tooth segmentation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the feasibility of our proposed method and the potential of the boundary prompt mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bochao Zou, Zizheng Guo, Jiansheng Chen, Junbao Zhuo, Weiran Huang, Huimin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for detecting physiological signals based on facial videos, holding high potential in various applications. Due to the periodicity nature of rPPG signals, the long-range dependency capturing capacity of the transformer was assumed to be advantageous for such signals. However, existing methods have not conclusively demonstrated the superior performance of transformers over traditional convolutional neural networks. This may be attributed to the quadratic scaling exhibited by transformer with sequence length, resulting in coarse-grained feature extraction, which in turn affects robustness and generalization. To address that, this paper proposes a periodic sparse attention mechanism based on temporal attention sparsity induced by periodicity. A pre-attention stage is introduced before the conventional attention mechanism. This stage learns periodic patterns to filter out a large number of irrelevant attention computations, thus enabling fine-grained feature extraction. Moreover, to address the issue of fine-grained features being more susceptible to noise interference, a fusion stem is proposed to effectively guide self-attention towards rPPG features. It can be easily integrated into existing methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Wang, Bo Hu, Mingyang Zhang, Jie Li, Leida Li, Maoguo Gong, Xinbo Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing free-energy guided No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods still suffer from finding a balance between learning feature information at the pixel level of the image and capturing high-level feature information and the efficient utilization of the obtained high-level feature information remains a challenge. As a novel class of state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative model, the diffusion model exhibits the capability to model intricate relationships, enabling a comprehensive understanding of images and possessing a better learning of both high-level and low-level visual features. In view of these, we pioneer the exploration of the diffusion model into the domain of NR-IQA. Firstly, we devise a new diffusion restoration network that leverages the produced enhanced image and noise-containing images, incorporating nonlinear features obtained during the denoising process of the diffusion model, as high-level visual information. Secondly, two visual evaluation branches are designed to comprehensively analyze the obtained high-level feature information. These include the visual compensation guidance branch, grounded in the transformer architecture and noise embedding strategy, and the visual difference analysis branch, built on the ResNet architecture and the residual transposed attention block. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven public NR-IQA datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms SOTA methods for NR-IQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoyan Zheng, Hongyu Yang, Di Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in video semantic segmentation have made substantial progress by exploiting temporal correlations. Nevertheless, persistent challenges, including redundant computation and the reliability of the feature propagation process, underscore the need for further innovation. In response, we present Deep Common Feature Mining (DCFM), a novel approach strategically designed to address these challenges by leveraging the concept of feature sharing. DCFM explicitly decomposes features into two complementary components. The common representation extracted from a key-frame furnishes essential high-level information to neighboring non-key frames, allowing for direct re-utilization without feature propagation. Simultaneously, the independent feature, derived from each video frame, captures rapidly changing information, providing frame-specific clues crucial for segmentation. To achieve such decomposition, we employ a symmetric training strategy tailored for sparsely annotated data, empowering the backbone to learn a robust high-level representation enriched with common information. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised loss function to reinforce intra-class feature similarity and enhance temporal consistency. Experimental evaluations on the VSPW and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Blind super-resolution methods based on stable diffusion showcase formidable generative capabilities in reconstructing clear high-resolution images with intricate details from low-resolution inputs.

Furthermore, we refine the training process by employing HR images, rather than LR images, to regulate the teacher model, providing a more robust constraint for distillation. Second, we introduce a timestep-adaptive ADD to address the perception-distortion imbalance problem introduced by original ADD.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elham Amin Mansour, Ozan Unal, Suman Saha, Benjamin Bejar, Luc Van Gool</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing relevance of panoptic segmentation is tied to the advancements in autonomous driving and AR/VR applications. However, the deployment of such models has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation, giving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in panoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an unlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance segmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of semantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level adaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix significantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation performance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted instances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the exhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected confirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of degraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based domain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language prompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two mechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular panoptic UDA benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sotirios Konstantakos, Jorgen Cani, Ioannis Mademlis, Despina Ioanna Chalkiadaki, Yuki M. Asano, Efstratios Gavves, Georgios Th. Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a valuable and robust training methodology for contemporary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), enabling unsupervised pretraining on a 'pretext task' that does not require ground-truth labels/annotation. This allows efficient representation learning from massive amounts of unlabeled training data, which in turn leads to increased accuracy in a 'downstream task' by exploiting supervised transfer learning. Despite the relatively straightforward conceptualization and applicability of SSL, it is not always feasible to collect and/or to utilize very large pretraining datasets, especially when it comes to real-world application settings. In particular, in cases of specialized and domain-specific application scenarios, it may not be achievable or practical to assemble a relevant image pretraining dataset in the order of millions of instances or it could be computationally infeasible to pretrain at this scale, e.g., due to unavailability of sufficient computational resources that SSL methods typically require to produce improved visual analysis results. This situation motivates an investigation on the effectiveness of common SSL pretext tasks, when the pretraining dataset is of relatively limited/constrained size. This work briefly introduces the main families of modern visual SSL methods and, subsequently, conducts a thorough comparative experimental evaluation in the low-data regime, targeting to identify: a) what is learnt via low-data SSL pretraining, and b) how do different SSL categories behave in such training scenarios. Interestingly, for domain-specific downstream tasks, in-domain low-data SSL pretraining outperforms the common approach of large-scale pretraining on general datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to train models collectively while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces challenges in terms of communication cost and data heterogeneity. One-shot federated learning has emerged as a solution by reducing communication rounds, improving efficiency, and providing better security against eavesdropping attacks. Nevertheless, data heterogeneity remains a significant challenge, impacting performance. This work explores the effectiveness of diffusion models in one-shot FL, demonstrating their applicability in addressing data heterogeneity and improving FL performance. Additionally, we investigate the utility of our diffusion model approach, FedDiff, compared to other one-shot FL methods under differential privacy (DP). Furthermore, to improve generated sample quality under DP settings, we propose a pragmatic Fourier Magnitude Filtering (FMF) method, enhancing the effectiveness of generated data for global model training.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce VectorPainter, a novel framework designed for reference-guided text-to-vector-graphics synthesis. Based on our observation that the style of strokes can be an important aspect to distinguish different artists, our method reforms the task into synthesize a desired vector graphics by rearranging stylized strokes, which are vectorized from the reference images. Specifically, our method first converts the pixels of the reference image into a series of vector strokes, and then generates a vector graphic based on the input text description by optimizing the positions and colors of these vector strokes. To precisely capture the style of the reference image in the vectorized strokes, we propose an innovative vectorization method that employs an imitation learning strategy. To preserve the style of the strokes throughout the generation process, we introduce a style-preserving loss function. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing works in stylized vector graphics synthesis, as well as the effectiveness of the various components of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Liu, Liang Yao, Chuanyi Zhang, Ting Wu, Xinlei Zhang, Xiruo Jiang, Jun Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting objects from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is often hindered by a large number of small objects, resulting in low detection accuracy. To address this issue, mainstream approaches typically utilize multi-stage inferences. Despite their remarkable detecting accuracies, real-time efficiency is sacrificed, making them less practical to handle real applications. To this end, we propose to improve the single-stage inference accuracy through learning scale-invariant features. Specifically, a Scale-Invariant Feature Disentangling module is designed to disentangle scale-related and scale-invariant features. Then an Adversarial Feature Learning scheme is employed to enhance disentanglement. Finally, scale-invariant features are leveraged for robust UAV-based object detection. Furthermore, we construct a multi-modal UAV object detection dataset, State-Air, which incorporates annotated UAV state parameters. We apply our approach to three lightweight detection frameworks on two benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively improve model accuracy and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on two datasets. Our code and dataset will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dening Lu, Jun Zhou, Kyle Gao, Linlin Xu, Jonathan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Transformers have achieved great success in point cloud understanding and representation. However, there is still considerable scope for further development in effective and efficient Transformers for large-scale LiDAR point cloud scene segmentation. This paper proposes a novel 3D Transformer framework, named 3D Learnable Supertoken Transformer (3DLST). The key contributions are summarized as follows. Firstly, we introduce the first Dynamic Supertoken Optimization (DSO) block for efficient token clustering and aggregating, where the learnable supertoken definition avoids the time-consuming pre-processing of traditional superpoint generation. Since the learnable supertokens can be dynamically optimized by multi-level deep features during network learning, they are tailored to the semantic homogeneity-aware token clustering. Secondly, an efficient Cross-Attention-guided Upsampling (CAU) block is proposed for token reconstruction from optimized supertokens. Thirdly, the 3DLST is equipped with a novel W-net architecture instead of the common U-net design, which is more suitable for Transformer-based feature learning. The SOTA performance on three challenging LiDAR datasets (airborne MultiSpectral LiDAR (MS-LiDAR) (89.3% of the average F1 score), DALES (80.2% of mIoU), and Toronto-3D dataset (80.4% of mIoU)) demonstrate the superiority of 3DLST and its strong adaptability to various LiDAR point cloud data (airborne MS-LiDAR, aerial LiDAR, and vehicle-mounted LiDAR data). Furthermore, 3DLST also achieves satisfactory results in terms of algorithm efficiency, which is up to 5x faster than previous best-performing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, LiDAR point cloud processing and analysis have made great progress due to the development of 3D Transformers. However, existing 3D Transformer methods usually are computationally expensive and inefficient due to their huge and redundant attention maps. They also tend to be slow due to requiring time-consuming point cloud sampling and grouping processes. To address these issues, we propose an efficient point TransFormer with Dynamic Token Aggregating (DTA-Former) for point cloud representation and processing. Firstly, we propose an efficient Learnable Token Sparsification (LTS) block, which considers both local and global semantic information for the adaptive selection of key tokens. Secondly, to achieve the feature aggregation for sparsified tokens, we present the first Dynamic Token Aggregating (DTA) block in the 3D Transformer paradigm, providing our model with strong aggregated features while preventing information loss. After that, a dual-attention Transformer-based Global Feature Enhancement (GFE) block is used to improve the representation capability of the model. Equipped with LTS, DTA, and GFE blocks, DTA-Former achieves excellent classification results via hierarchical feature learning. Lastly, a novel Iterative Token Reconstruction (ITR) block is introduced for dense prediction whereby the semantic features of tokens and their semantic relationships are gradually optimized during iterative reconstruction. Based on ITR, we propose a new W-net architecture, which is more suitable for Transformer-based feature learning than the common U-net design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinedu Innocent Nwoye, Nicolas Padoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate tool tracking is essential for the success of computer-assisted intervention. Previous efforts often modeled tool trajectories rigidly, overlooking the dynamic nature of surgical procedures, especially tracking scenarios like out-of-body and out-of-camera views. Addressing this limitation, the new CholecTrack20 dataset provides detailed labels that account for multiple tool trajectories in three perspectives: (1) intraoperative, (2) intracorporeal, and (3) visibility, representing the different types of temporal duration of tool tracks. These fine-grained labels enhance tracking flexibility but also increase the task complexity. Re-identifying tools after occlusion or re-insertion into the body remains challenging due to high visual similarity, especially among tools of the same category. This work recognizes the critical role of the tool operators in distinguishing tool track instances, especially those belonging to the same tool category. The operators' information are however not explicitly captured in surgical videos. We therefore propose SurgiTrack, a novel deep learning method that leverages YOLOv7 for precise tool detection and employs an attention mechanism to model the originating direction of the tools, as a proxy to their operators, for tool re-identification. To handle diverse tool trajectory perspectives, SurgiTrack employs a harmonizing bipartite matching graph, minimizing conflicts and ensuring accurate tool identity association. Experimental results on CholecTrack20 demonstrate SurgiTrack's effectiveness, outperforming baselines and state-of-the-art methods with real-time inference capability. This work sets a new standard in surgical tool tracking, providing dynamic trajectories for more adaptable and precise assistance in minimally invasive surgeries.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) marks significant strides towards achieving general artificial intelligence. However, these advancements are accompanied by concerns about biased outputs, a challenge that has yet to be thoroughly explored. Existing benchmarks are not sufficiently comprehensive in evaluating biases due to their limited data scale, single questioning format and narrow sources of bias. To address this problem, we introduce VLBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases in LVLMs. VLBiasBench, features a dataset that covers nine distinct categories of social biases, including age, disability status, gender, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, profession, social economic status, as well as two intersectional bias categories: race x gender and race x social economic status. To build a large-scale dataset, we use Stable Diffusion XL model to generate 46,848 high-quality images, which are combined with various questions to creat 128,342 samples. These questions are divided into open-ended and close-ended types, ensuring thorough consideration of bias sources and a comprehensive evaluation of LVLM biases from multiple perspectives. We conduct extensive evaluations on 15 open-source models as well as two advanced closed-source models, yielding new insights into the biases present in these models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Ciotola, Giuseppe Guarino, Gemine Vivone, Giovanni Poggi, Jocelyn Chanussot, Antonio Plaza, Giuseppe Scarpa</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral pansharpening consists of fusing a high-resolution panchromatic band and a low-resolution hyperspectral image to obtain a new image with high resolution in both the spatial and spectral domains. These remote sensing products are valuable for a wide range of applications, driving ever growing research efforts. Nonetheless, results still do not meet application demands. In part, this comes from the technical complexity of the task: compared to multispectral pansharpening, many more bands are involved, in a spectral range only partially covered by the panchromatic component and with overwhelming noise. However, another major limiting factor is the absence of a comprehensive framework for the rapid development and accurate evaluation of new methods. This paper attempts to address this issue.
  We started by designing a dataset large and diverse enough to allow reliable training (for data-driven methods) and testing of new methods. Then, we selected a set of state-of-the-art methods, following different approaches, characterized by promising performance, and reimplemented them in a single PyTorch framework. Finally, we carried out a critical comparative analysis of all methods, using the most accredited quality indicators. The analysis highlights the main limitations of current solutions in terms of spectral/spatial quality and computational efficiency, and suggests promising research directions.

<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive progress of multimodal generative models, video-to-audio generation still suffers from limited performance and limits the flexibility to prioritize sound synthesis for specific objects within the scene. Conversely, text-to-audio generation methods generate high-quality audio but pose challenges in ensuring comprehensive scene depiction and time-varying control. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel video-and-text-to-audio generation method, called \ours, where video serves as a conditional control for a text-to-audio generation model. Especially, our method estimates the structural information of sound (namely, energy) from the video while receiving key content cues from a user prompt. We employ a well-performing text-to-audio model to consolidate the video control, which is much more efficient for training multimodal diffusion models with massive triplet-paired (audio-video-text) data. In addition, by separating the generative components of audio, it becomes a more flexible system that allows users to freely adjust the energy, surrounding environment, and primary sound source according to their preferences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soyeong Kwon, Taegyeong Lee, Taehwan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-guided image editing and generation methods have diverse real-world applications. However, text-guided infinite image synthesis faces several challenges. First, there is a lack of text-image paired datasets with high-resolution and contextual diversity. Second, expanding images based on text requires global coherence and rich local context understanding. Previous studies have mainly focused on limited categories, such as natural landscapes, and also required to train on high-resolution images with paired text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for both global coherence and local context understanding, without any high-resolution text-image paired training dataset. We train the diffusion model to expand an image conditioned on global and local captions generated from the LLM and visual feature. At the inference stage, given an image and a global caption, we use the LLM to generate a next local caption to expand the input image. Then, we expand the image using the global caption, generated local caption and the visual feature to consider global consistency and spatial local context. In experiments, our model outperforms the baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our model demonstrates the capability of text-guided arbitrary-sized image generation in zero-shot manner with LLM guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madhava Krishna, A V Subramanyam</p>
<p>Abstract: SimMIM is a widely used method for pretraining vision transformers using masked image modeling. However, despite its success in fine-tuning performance, it has been shown to perform sub-optimally when used for linear probing. We propose an efficient patch-wise weighting derived from keypoint features which captures the local information and provides better context during SimMIM's reconstruction phase. Our method, KAMIM, improves the top-1 linear probing accuracy from 16.12% to 33.97%, and finetuning accuracy from 76.78% to 77.3% when tested on the ImageNet-1K dataset with a ViT-B when trained for the same number of epochs. We conduct extensive testing on different datasets, keypoint extractors, and model architectures and observe that patch-wise weighting augments linear probing performance for larger pretraining datasets. We also analyze the learned representations of a ViT-B trained using KAMIM and observe that they behave similar to contrastive learning with regard to its behavior, with longer attention distances and homogenous self-attention across layers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Liang, Zhuo Deng, Zheming Zhou, Min Sun, Omid Ghasemalizadeh, Cheng-Hao Kuo, Arnie Sen, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: We extend our previous work, PoCo, and present a new algorithm, Cross-Source-Context Place Recognition (CSCPR), for RGB-D indoor place recognition that integrates global retrieval and reranking into an end-to-end model and keeps the consistency of using Context-of-Clusters (CoCs) for feature processing. Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on the RGB domain for place recognition reranking, CSCPR is designed to handle the RGB-D data. We apply the CoCs to handle cross-sourced and cross-scaled RGB-D point clouds and introduce two novel modules for reranking: the Self-Context Cluster (SCC) and the Cross Source Context Cluster (CSCC), which enhance feature representation and match query-database pairs based on local features, respectively. We also release two new datasets, ScanNetIPR and ARKitIPR. Our experiments demonstrate that CSCPR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on these datasets by at least 29.27% in Recall@1 on the ScanNet-PR dataset and 43.24% in the new datasets.

<p>Abstract: We propose HYBRIDDEPTH, a robust depth estimation pipeline that addresses key challenges in depth estimation,including scale ambiguity, hardware heterogeneity, and generalizability. HYBRIDDEPTH leverages focal stack, data conveniently accessible in common mobile devices, to produce accurate metric depth maps. By incorporating depth priors afforded by recent advances in singleimage depth estimation, our model achieves a higher level of structural detail compared to existing methods. We test our pipeline as an end-to-end system, with a newly developed mobile client to capture focal stacks, which are then sent to a GPU-powered server for depth estimation. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that HYBRIDDEPTH outperforms state-of-the-art(SOTA) models on common datasets such as DDFF12 and NYU Depth V2. HYBRIDDEPTH also shows strong zero-shot generalization. When trained on NYU Depth V2, HYBRIDDEPTH surpasses SOTA models in zero-shot performance on ARKitScenes and delivers more structurally accurate depth maps on Mobile Depth.

<p>Abstract: News media, especially video news media, have penetrated into every aspect of daily life, which also brings the risk of fake news. Therefore, multimodal fake news detection has recently garnered increased attention. However, the existing datasets are comprised of user-uploaded videos and contain an excess amounts of superfluous data, which introduces noise into the model training process. To address this issue, we construct a dataset named Official-NV, comprising officially published news videos. The crawl officially published videos are augmented through the use of LLMs-based generation and manual verification, thereby expanding the dataset. We also propose a new baseline model called OFNVD, which captures key information from multimodal features through a GLU attention mechanism and performs feature enhancement and modal aggregation via a cross-modal Transformer. Benchmarking the dataset and baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in multimodal news detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Zhang, Wei Sun, Xinyue Li, Jun Jia, Xiongkuo Min, Zicheng Zhang, Chunyi Li, Zijian Chen, Puyi Wang, Fengyu Sun, Shangling Jui, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven video generation has gained significant attention. Consequently, there is a growing need for accurate video quality assessment (VQA) metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of AIGC videos remains a significant challenge because these videos often exhibit highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and irrational objects. To address this challenge, we systematically investigate the AIGC-VQA problem, considering both subjective and objective quality assessment perspectives. For the subjective perspective, we construct the Large-scale Generated Video Quality assessment (LGVQ) dataset, consisting of 2,808 AIGC videos generated by 6 video generation models using 468 carefully curated text prompts. We evaluate the perceptual quality of AIGC videos from three critical dimensions: spatial quality, temporal quality, and text-video alignment. For the objective perspective, we establish a benchmark for evaluating existing quality assessment metrics on the LGVQ dataset. Our findings show that current metrics perform poorly on this dataset, highlighting a gap in effective evaluation tools. To bridge this gap, we propose the Unify Generated Video Quality assessment (UGVQ) model, designed to accurately evaluate the multi-dimensional quality of AIGC videos. The UGVQ model integrates the visual and motion features of videos with the textual features of their corresponding prompts, forming a unified quality-aware feature representation tailored to AIGC videos. Experimental results demonstrate that UGVQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LGVQ dataset across all three quality dimensions. Both the LGVQ dataset and the UGVQ model are publicly available on https://github.com/zczhang-sjtu/UGVQ.git.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bi'an Du, Lingbei Meng, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is a major challenge in computer vision, aiming to create complete three-dimensional models from limited viewing angles. Key obstacles include: 1) a small number of input images with inconsistent information; 2) dependence on input image quality; and 3) large model parameter sizes. To tackle these issues, we propose a self-augmented two-stage Gaussian splatting framework enhanced with structural masks for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Initially, our method generates a basic 3D Gaussian representation from sparse inputs and renders multi-view images. We then fine-tune a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to enhance these images, using them as augmented data to further optimize the 3D Gaussians.Additionally, a structural masking strategy during training enhances the model's robustness to sparse inputs and noise. Experiments on benchmarks like MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, and OpenIllumination demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and multi-view consistency with sparse inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Yongsheng Pan, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical image segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images from diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models. Many Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These methods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to suboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed step-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the Gradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both the gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike conventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived from a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient with the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment enables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and correct the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to the current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate based on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients, thereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse test data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed gradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority of our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark medical image segmentation task.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazi Hasan Ibn Arif, JinYi Yoon, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos, Hans Vandierendonck, Deepu John, Bo Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: High-resolution Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are widely used in multimodal tasks to enhance accuracy by preserving detailed image information. However, these models often generate an excessive number of visual tokens due to the need to encode multiple partitions of a high-resolution image input. Processing such a large number of visual tokens through multiple transformer networks poses significant computational challenges, particularly for resource-constrained commodity GPUs. To address this challenge, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping (HiRED), a plug-and-play token-dropping method designed to operate within a fixed token budget. HiRED leverages the attention of CLS token in the vision transformer (ViT) to assess the visual content of the image partitions and allocate an optimal token budget for each partition accordingly. The most informative visual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget are then selected and passed to the subsequent Large Language Model (LLM). We showed that HiRED achieves superior accuracy and performance, compared to existing token-dropping methods. Empirically, HiRED-20% (i.e., a 20% token budget) on LLaVA-Next-7B achieves a 4.7x increase in token generation throughput, reduces response latency by 78%, and saves 14% of GPU memory for single inference on an NVIDIA TESLA P40 (24 GB). For larger batch sizes (e.g., 4), HiRED-20% prevents out-of-memory errors by cutting memory usage by 30%, while preserving throughput and latency benefits.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13239">CustomCrafter: Customized Video Generation with Preserving Motion and Concept Composition Abilities</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wu, Yong Zhang, Xintao Wang, Xianpan Zhou, Guangcong Zheng, Zhongang Qi, Ying Shan, Xi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Customized video generation aims to generate high-quality videos guided by text prompts and subject's reference images. However, since it is only trained on static images, the fine-tuning process of subject learning disrupts abilities of video diffusion models (VDMs) to combine concepts and generate motions. To restore these abilities, some methods use additional video similar to the prompt to fine-tune or guide the model. This requires frequent changes of guiding videos and even re-tuning of the model when generating different motions, which is very inconvenient for users. In this paper, we propose CustomCrafter, a novel framework that preserves the model's motion generation and conceptual combination abilities without additional video and fine-tuning to recovery. For preserving conceptual combination ability, we design a plug-and-play module to update few parameters in VDMs, enhancing the model's ability to capture the appearance details and the ability of concept combinations for new subjects. For motion generation, we observed that VDMs tend to restore the motion of video in the early stage of denoising, while focusing on the recovery of subject details in the later stage. Therefore, we propose Dynamic Weighted Video Sampling Strategy. Using the pluggability of our subject learning modules, we reduce the impact of this module on motion generation in the early stage of denoising, preserving the ability to generate motion of VDMs. In the later stage of denoising, we restore this module to repair the appearance details of the specified subject, thereby ensuring the fidelity of the subject's appearance. Experimental results show that our method has a significant improvement compared to previous methods. Code is available at https://github.com/WuTao-CS/CustomCrafter</p>

<p>Abstract: Video generation models hold substantial potential in areas such as filmmaking. However, current video diffusion models need high computational costs and produce suboptimal results due to extreme complexity of video generation task. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ConFiner}, an efficient video generation framework that decouples video generation into easier subtasks: structure \textbf{con}trol and spatial-temporal re\textbf{fine}ment. It can generate high-quality videos with chain of off-the-shelf diffusion model experts, each expert responsible for a decoupled subtask. During the refinement, we introduce coordinated denoising, which can merge multiple diffusion experts' capabilities into a single sampling. Furthermore, we design ConFiner-Long framework, which can generate long coherent video with three constraint strategies on ConFiner. Experimental results indicate that with only 10\% of the inference cost, our ConFiner surpasses representative models like Lavie and Modelscope across all objective and subjective metrics. And ConFiner-Long can generate high-quality and coherent videos with up to 600 frames.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Yang, Qianyu Zhou, Haijia Sun, Xiangtai Li, Fengqi Liu, Xuequan Lu, Lizhuang Ma, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to improve the generalizability of point cloud classification (PCC) models toward unseen domains. However, they often suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using convolution neural networks or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the generalizability of state space models (SSMs) in DG PCC and find that directly applying SSMs into DG PCC will encounter several challenges: the inherent topology of the point cloud tends to be disrupted and leads to noise accumulation during the serialization stage. Besides, the lack of designs in domain-agnostic feature learning and data scanning will introduce unanticipated domain-specific information into the 3D sequence data. To this end, we propose a novel framework, PointDGMamba, that excels in strong generalizability toward unseen domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. PointDGMamba consists of three innovative components: Masked Sequence Denoising (MSD), Sequence-wise Cross-domain Feature Aggregation (SCFA), and Dual-level Domain Scanning (DDS). In particular, MSD selectively masks out the noised point tokens of the point cloud sequences, SCFA introduces cross-domain but same-class point cloud features to encourage the model to learn how to extract more generalized features. DDS includes intra-domain scanning and cross-domain scanning to facilitate information exchange between features. In addition, we propose a new and more challenging benchmark PointDG-3to1 for multi-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of PointDGMamba.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. However, existing efforts are still struggling to generate high-quality images with consistent pose alignment, resulting in unsatisfactory output. In this paper, we propose a framework that delves into the graph relations of pose priors to provide control information for human image generation. The main idea is to establish a graph topological structure between the pose priors and latent representation of diffusion models to capture the intrinsic associations between different pose parts. A Progressive Graph Integrator (PGI) is designed to learn the spatial relationships of the pose priors with the graph structure, adopting a hierarchical strategy within an Adapter to gradually propagate information across different pose parts. Besides, a pose perception loss is introduced based on a pretrained pose estimation network to minimize the pose differences. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on the Human-Art and LAION-Human datasets clearly demonstrate that our model can achieve significant performance improvement over the latest benchmark models.

<p>Abstract: Masked point modeling methods have recently achieved great success in self-supervised learning for point cloud data. However, these methods are sensitive to rotations and often exhibit sharp performance drops when encountering rotational variations. In this paper, we propose a novel Rotation-Invariant Masked AutoEncoders (RI-MAE) to address two major challenges: 1) achieving rotation-invariant latent representations, and 2) facilitating self-supervised reconstruction in a rotation-invariant manner. For the first challenge, we introduce RI-Transformer, which features disentangled geometry content, rotation-invariant relative orientation and position embedding mechanisms for constructing rotation-invariant point cloud latent space. For the second challenge, a novel dual-branch student-teacher architecture is devised. It enables the self-supervised learning via the reconstruction of masked patches within the learned rotation-invariant latent space. Each branch is based on an RI-Transformer, and they are connected with an additional RI-Transformer predictor. The teacher encodes all point patches, while the student solely encodes unmasked ones. Finally, the predictor predicts the latent features of the masked patches using the output latent embeddings from the student, supervised by the outputs from the teacher. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is robust to rotations, achieving the state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks.

<p>Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscription (OBI) is the earliest mature writing system in China, which represents a crucial stage in the development of hieroglyphs. Nevertheless, the substantial quantity of undeciphered OBI characters remains a significant challenge for scholars, while conventional methods of ancient script research are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a cross-font image retrieval network (CFIRN) to decipher OBI characters by establishing associations between OBI characters and other script forms, simulating the interpretive behavior of paleography scholars. Concretely, our network employs a siamese framework to extract deep features from character images of various fonts, fully exploring structure clues with different resolutions by multiscale feature integration (MFI) module and multiscale refinement classifier (MRC). Extensive experiments on three challenging cross-font image retrieval datasets demonstrate that, given undeciphered OBI characters, our CFIRN can effectively achieve accurate matches with characters from other gallery fonts, thereby facilitating the deciphering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiao Xiao, Boqian Wu, Lu Yin, Christopher Neil Gadzinski, Tianjin Huang, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Decebal Constantin Mocanu</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning has demonstrated impressive progress, it remains a daunting challenge to learn from hard samples as these samples are usually noisy and intricate. These hard samples play a crucial role in the optimal performance of deep neural networks. Most research on Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) has focused on standard training data, leaving gaps in understanding their effectiveness on complex and challenging data. This paper's extensive investigation across scenarios reveals that most SNNs trained on challenging samples can often match or surpass dense models in accuracy at certain sparsity levels, especially with limited data. We observe that layer-wise density ratios tend to play an important role in SNN performance, particularly for methods that train from scratch without pre-trained initialization. These insights enhance our understanding of SNNs' behavior and potential for efficient learning approaches in data-centric AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Ye, Qiong Wu, Wenhao Lin, Yiyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) often use large image tokens to compensate the visual shortcoming of MLLMs, which not only exhibits obvious redundancy but also greatly exacerbates the already high computation. Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but when and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token pruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning recipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget. Specifically, FitPrune considers token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is to find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the attention distributions before and after pruning. In practice, FitPrune can be quickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of inference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs. According to the pruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of different examples during inference. To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set of recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experimental results show that our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large extent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT with only 0.5% accuracy drop. Notably, the pruning recipe can be obtained in about 5 minutes. Our code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/FitPrune.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> DaDong Jiang, Xianghui Yang, Zibo Zhao, Sheng Zhang, Jiaao Yu, Zeqiang Lai, Shaoxiong Yang, Chunchao Guo, Xiaobo Zhou, Zhihui Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results due to the powerful generative prior they leverage from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, abstract textual prompts are limited in providing global textural or shape information, which results in the texture generation methods producing blurry or inconsistent patterns. To tackle this, we present FlexiTex, embedding rich information via visual guidance to generate a high-quality texture. The core of FlexiTex is the Visual Guidance Enhancement module, which incorporates more specific information from visual guidance to reduce ambiguity in the text prompt and preserve high-frequency details. To further enhance the visual guidance, we introduce a Direction-Aware Adaptation module that automatically designs direction prompts based on different camera poses, avoiding the Janus problem and maintaining semantically global consistency. Benefiting from the visual guidance, FlexiTex produces quantitatively and qualitatively sound results, demonstrating its potential to advance texture generation for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sen Lei, Xinyu Xiao, Tianlin Zhang, Heng-Chao Li, Zhenwei Shi, Qing Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a language expression, referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) aims to identify ground objects and assign pixel-wise labels within the imagery. The one of key challenges for this task is to capture discriminative multi-modal features via text-image alignment. However, the existing RRSIS methods use one vanilla and coarse alignment, where the language expression is directly extracted to be fused with the visual features. In this paper, we argue that a ``fine-grained image-text alignment'' can improve the extraction of multi-modal information. To this point, we propose a new referring remote sensing image segmentation method to fully exploit the visual and linguistic representations. Specifically, the original referring expression is regarded as context text, which is further decoupled into the ground object and spatial position texts. The proposed fine-grained image-text alignment module (FIAM) would simultaneously leverage the features of the input image and the corresponding texts, obtaining better discriminative multi-modal representation. Meanwhile, to handle the various scales of ground objects in remote sensing, we introduce a Text-aware Multi-scale Enhancement Module (TMEM) to adaptively perform cross-scale fusion and intersections. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two public referring remote sensing datasets including RefSegRS and RRSIS-D, and our method obtains superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Shaosifan/FIANet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tieyuan Chen, Huabin Liu, Tianyao He, Yihang Chen, Chaofan Gan, Xiao Ma, Cheng Zhong, Yang Zhang, Yingxue Wang, Hui Lin, Weiyao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Video causal reasoning aims to achieve a high-level understanding of video content from a causal perspective. However, current video reasoning tasks are limited in scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on short videos containing only a single event and simple causal relationships, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relationships between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD requires identifying the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive, structured event-level video causal diagram explaining why and how the final result event occurred. To address MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, using an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test, which estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to address challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in providing causal relationships in multi-event videos, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoLLaVA by 5.7% and 4.1%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoxuan Li, Xu Zhang, Shumeng Yu, Haipeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning technologies have significantly improved performance in the field of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image target recognition compared to traditional methods. However, the inherent ``black box" property of deep learning models leads to a lack of transparency in decision-making processes, making them difficult to be widespread applied in practice. To tackle this issue, this study proposes a physically explainable framework for complex-valued SAR image recognition, designed based on the physical process of microwave propagation. This framework utilizes complex-valued SAR data to explore the amplitude and phase information and its intrinsic physical properties. The network architecture is fully parameterized, with all learnable parameters endowed with clear physical meanings. Experiments on both the complex-valued MSTAR dataset and a self-built Qilu-1 complex-valued dataset were conducted to validate the effectiveness of framework. The de-overlapping capability of EMWaveNet enables accurate recognition of overlapping target categories, whereas other models are nearly incapable of performing such recognition. Against 0dB forest background noise, it boasts a 20\% accuracy improvement over traditional neural networks. When targets are 60\% masked by noise, it still outperforms other models by 9\%. An end-to-end complex-valued synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) algorithm is constructed to perform recognition tasks in interference SAR scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses a strong physical decision logic, high physical explainability and robustness, as well as excellent de-aliasing capabilities. Finally, a perspective on future applications is provided.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxiang Gou, Luping Ji, Pei Liu, Mao Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has very significant applications in clinical pathology, e.g., tumor identification and cancer diagnosis. Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches: one is for generating bag-level features by prototype-guided aggregation of instance features, while the other is for enhancing class features through a combination of class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four public WSI datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<p>Abstract: Accurate classification of medical images is critical for detecting abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract, a domain where misclassification can significantly impact patient outcomes. We propose an ensemble-based approach to improve diagnostic accuracy in analyzing complex image datasets.

The classification models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors are introduced to further diversify the predictive power of proposed ensemble. By using these methods, the proposed framework, CAVE-Net, provides robust feature discrimination and improved classification results. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the CAVE-Net achieves high accuracy and robustness across challenging and imbalanced classes, showing significant promise for broader applications in computer vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Xu, Zexin Fan, Jian Yang, Jin Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Gaussian splatting has received more and more attention in the field of static scene rendering. Due to the low computational overhead and inherent flexibility of explicit representations, plane-based explicit methods are popular ways to predict deformations for Gaussian-based dynamic scene rendering models. However, plane-based methods rely on the inappropriate low-rank assumption and excessively decompose the space-time 4D encoding, resulting in overmuch feature overlap and unsatisfactory rendering quality. To tackle these problems, we propose Grid4D, a dynamic scene rendering model based on Gaussian splatting and employing a novel explicit encoding method for the 4D input through the hash encoding. Different from plane-based explicit representations, we decompose the 4D encoding into one spatial and three temporal 3D hash encodings without the low-rank assumption. Additionally, we design a novel attention module that generates the attention scores in a directional range to aggregate the spatial and temporal features. The directional attention enables Grid4D to more accurately fit the diverse deformations across distinct scene components based on the spatial encoded features. Moreover, to mitigate the inherent lack of smoothness in explicit representation methods, we introduce a smooth regularization term that keeps our model from the chaos of deformation prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that Grid4D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in visual quality and rendering speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagnik Majumder, Tushar Nagarajan, Ziad Al-Halah, Reina Pradhan, Kristen Grauman</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a multi-view video, which viewpoint is most informative for a human observer? Existing methods rely on heuristics or expensive "best-view" supervision to answer this question, limiting their applicability. We propose a weakly supervised approach that leverages language accompanying an instructional multi-view video as a means to recover its most informative viewpoint(s). Our key hypothesis is that the more accurately an individual view can predict a view-agnostic text summary, the more informative it is. To put this into action, we propose a framework that uses the relative accuracy of view-dependent caption predictions as a proxy for best view pseudo-labels. Then, those pseudo-labels are used to train a view selector, together with an auxiliary camera pose predictor that enhances view-sensitivity. During inference, our model takes as input only a multi-view video--no language or camera poses--and returns the best viewpoint to watch at each timestep. On two challenging datasets comprised of diverse multi-camera setups and how-to activities, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, both with quantitative metrics and human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingyuan Shi, Yong Wang, Hangyu Li, Xiangxiang Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, making alignment methods for these models increasingly important. A key challenge is the sparsity of preference labels, which are typically available only at the terminal of denoising trajectories. This raises the issue of how to assign credit across denoising steps based on these sparse labels. In this paper, we propose Denoised Distribution Estimation (DDE), a novel method for credit assignment. Unlike previous approaches that rely on auxiliary models or hand-crafted schemes, DDE derives its strategy more explicitly. The proposed DDE directly estimates the terminal denoised distribution from the perspective of each step. It is equipped with two estimation strategies and capable of representing the entire denoising trajectory with a single model inference. Theoretically and empirically, we show that DDE prioritizes optimizing the middle part of the denoising trajectory, resulting in a novel and effective credit assignment scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajing Lin, Zhenzhong Wang, Shu Jiang, Yongjie Hou, Min Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of 4D content generation involves creating dynamic 3D models that evolve over time in response to specific input conditions, such as images. Existing methods rely heavily on pre-trained video diffusion models to guide 4D content dynamics, but these approaches often fail to capture essential physical principles, as video diffusion models lack a robust understanding of real-world physics. Moreover, these models face challenges in providing fine-grained control over dynamics and exhibit high computational costs. In this work, we propose Phys4DGen, a novel, high-efficiency framework that generates physics-compliant 4D content from a single image with enhanced control capabilities. Our approach uniquely integrates physical simulations into the 4D generation pipeline, ensuring adherence to fundamental physical laws. Inspired by the human ability to infer physical properties visually, we introduce a Physical Perception Module (PPM) that discerns the material properties and structural components of the 3D object from the input image, facilitating accurate downstream simulations. Phys4DGen significantly accelerates the 4D generation process by eliminating iterative optimization steps in the dynamics modeling phase. It allows users to intuitively control the movement speed and direction of generated 4D content by adjusting external forces, achieving finely tunable, physically plausible animations. Extensive evaluations show that Phys4DGen outperforms existing methods in both inference speed and physical realism, producing high-quality, controllable 4D content.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui-Yue Yang, Hui Chen, Ao Wang, Kai Chen, Zijia Lin, Yongliang Tang, Pengcheng Gao, Yuming Quan, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has made great progress in anomaly segmentation tasks due to its impressive generalization ability. However, existing methods that directly apply SAM through prompting often overlook the domain shift issue, where SAM performs well on natural images but struggles in industrial scenarios. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a promising solution, but it may yield suboptimal performance by not adequately addressing the perception challenges during adaptation to anomaly images. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{P}erceptinon \textbf{T}uning (\textbf{SPT}) method, aiming to enhance SAM's perception capability for anomaly segmentation. The SPT method incorporates a self-drafting tuning strategy, which generates an initial coarse draft of the anomaly mask, followed by a refinement process. Additionally, a visual-relation-aware adapter is introduced to improve the perception of discriminative relational information for mask generation. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method can significantly outperform baseline methods, validating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriar Soudeep, M. F. Mridha, Md Abrar Jahin, Nilanjan Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate detection and tracking of small objects, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes, is critical for traffic surveillance systems, which are crucial for improving road safety and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional methods face challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small-object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates a DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thereby ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Additionally, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques were applied to DGNN-YOLO to provide model-agnostic interpretability and deeper insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing its transparency and trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrated that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects. This study provides a scalable, real-time traffic surveillance and analysis solution, significantly contributing to intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhai Wang, Maryam Pishgar</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerial-Ground Person Re-identification (AGPReID) holds significant practical value but faces unique challenges due to pronounced variations in viewing angles, lighting conditions, and background interference. Traditional methods, often involving a global analysis of the entire image, frequently lead to inefficiencies and susceptibility to irrelevant data. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Token Selective Transformer (DTST) tailored for AGPReID, which dynamically selects pivotal tokens to concentrate on pertinent regions. Specifically, we segment the input image into multiple tokens, with each token representing a unique region or feature within the image. Using a Top-k strategy, we extract the k most significant tokens that contain vital information essential for identity recognition. Subsequently, an attention mechanism is employed to discern interrelations among diverse tokens, thereby enhancing the representation of identity features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets showcases the superiority of our method over existing works. Notably, on the CARGO dataset, our proposed method gains 1.18% mAP improvements when compared to the second place. In addition, we comprehensively analyze the impact of different numbers of tokens, token insertion positions, and numbers of heads on model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixiang Wang, Guangnan Ye, Xiaosen Wang, Siheng Chen, Zhibo Wang, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical adversarial patches printed on clothing can easily allow individuals to evade person detectors. However, most existing adversarial patch generation methods prioritize attack effectiveness over stealthiness, resulting in patches that are aesthetically unpleasing. Although existing methods using generative adversarial networks or diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often struggle to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based customizable patch generation framework termed DiffPatch, specifically tailored for creating naturalistic and customizable adversarial patches. Our approach enables users to utilize a reference image as the source, rather than starting from random noise, and incorporates masks to craft naturalistic patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To prevent the original semantics from being lost during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Notably, while maintaining a natural appearance, our method achieves a comparable attack performance to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches when using similarly sized attacks. Using DiffPatch, we have created a physical adversarial T-shirt dataset, AdvPatch-1K, specifically targeting YOLOv5s. This dataset includes over a thousand images across diverse scenarios, validating the effectiveness of our attack in real-world environments. Moreover, it provides a valuable resource for future research.</p>

This system enables agents to maintain and expand their memory through both imaginative mechanisms and navigation actions. Additionally, we design tailored pre-training tasks to develop the agent's imaginative capabilities. Our agent can imagine high-fidelity RGB images for future scenes, achieving state-of-the-art result in Success rate weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicong Tian, Haiyu Wu, Michael C. King, Kevin W. Bowyer</p>
<p>Abstract: One-to-many facial identification is documented to achieve high accuracy in the case where both the probe and the gallery are "mugshot quality" images. However, an increasing number of documented instances of wrongful arrest following one-to-many facial identification have raised questions about its accuracy. Probe images used in one-to-many facial identification are often cropped from frames of surveillance video and deviate from "mugshot quality" in various ways. This paper systematically explores how the accuracy of one-to-many facial identification is degraded by the person in the probe image choosing to wear dark sunglasses. We show that sunglasses degrade accuracy for mugshot-quality images by an amount similar to strong blur or noticeably lower resolution. Further, we demonstrate that the combination of sunglasses with blur or lower resolution results in even more pronounced loss in accuracy. These results have important implications for developing objective criteria to qualify a probe image for the level of accuracy to be expected if it used for one-to-many identification. To ameliorate the accuracy degradation caused by dark sunglasses, we show that it is possible to recover about 38% of the lost accuracy by synthetically adding sunglasses to all the gallery images, without model re-training. We also show that the frequency of wearing-sunglasses images is very low in existing training sets, and that increasing the representation of wearing-sunglasses images can greatly reduce the error rate. The image set assembled for this research is available at https://cvrl.nd.edu/projects/data/ to support replication and further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) models fail to address a practical issue in medical imaging: the domain shift caused by different imaging techniques, which limits the applicability to current FSMIS tasks. To overcome this limitation, we focus on the cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) task, aiming to develop a generalized model capable of adapting to a broader range of medical image segmentation scenarios with limited labeled data from the novel target domain. Inspired by the characteristics of frequency domain similarity across different domains, we propose a Frequency-aware Matching Network (FAMNet), which includes two key components: a Frequency-aware Matching (FAM) module and a Multi-Spectral Fusion (MSF) module. The FAM module tackles two problems during the meta-learning phase: 1) intra-domain variance caused by the inherent support-query bias, due to the different appearances of organs and lesions, and 2) inter-domain variance caused by different medical imaging techniques. Additionally, we design an MSF module to integrate the different frequency features decoupled by the FAM module, and further mitigate the impact of inter-domain variance on the model's segmentation performance. Combining these two modules, our FAMNet surpasses existing FSMIS models and Cross-domain Few-shot Semantic Segmentation models on three cross-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the CD-FSMIS task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun-Mei Feng, Yuanyang He, Jian Zou, Salman Khan, Huan Xiong, Zhen Li, Wangmeng Zuo, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing test-time prompt tuning (TPT) methods focus on single-modality data, primarily enhancing images and using confidence ratings to filter out inaccurate images. However, while image generation models can produce visually diverse images, single-modality data enhancement techniques still fail to capture the comprehensive knowledge provided by different modalities. Additionally, we note that the performance of TPT-based methods drops significantly when the number of augmented images is limited, which is not unusual given the computational expense of generative augmentation. To address these issues, we introduce IT3A, a novel test-time adaptation method that utilizes a pre-trained generative model for multi-modal augmentation of each test sample from unknown new domains. By combining augmented data from pre-trained vision and language models, we enhance the ability of the model to adapt to unknown new test data. Additionally, to ensure that key semantics are accurately retained when generating various visual and text enhancements, we employ cosine similarity filtering between the logits of the enhanced images and text with the original test data. This process allows us to filter out some spurious augmentation and inadequate combinations. To leverage the diverse enhancements provided by the generation model across different modals, we have replaced prompt tuning with an adapter for greater flexibility in utilizing text templates. Our experiments on the test datasets with distribution shifts and domain gaps show that in a zero-shot setting, IT3A outperforms state-of-the-art test-time prompt tuning methods with a 5.50% increase in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Sheng, Wei Lu, Xiangyang Luo, Jiantao Zhou, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Image forgery localization (IFL) is a crucial technique for preventing tampered image misuse and protecting social safety. However, due to the rapid development of image tampering technologies, extracting more comprehensive and accurate forgery clues remains an urgent challenge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel information-theoretic IFL framework named SUMI-IFL that imposes sufficiency-view and minimality-view constraints on forgery feature representation. First, grounded in the theoretical analysis of mutual information, the sufficiency-view constraint is enforced on the feature extraction network to ensure that the latent forgery feature contains comprehensive forgery clues. Considering that forgery clues obtained from a single aspect alone may be incomplete, we construct the latent forgery feature by integrating several individual forgery features from multiple perspectives. Second, based on the information bottleneck, the minimality-view constraint is imposed on the feature reasoning network to achieve an accurate and concise forgery feature representation that counters the interference of task-unrelated features. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of SUMI-IFL to existing state-of-the-art methods, not only on in-dataset comparisons but also on cross-dataset comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiwei Yang, Yucong Meng, Kexue Fu, Shuo Wang, Zhijian Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels typically uses Class Activation Maps (CAM) to achieve dense predictions. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has provided an alternative to generate localization maps from class-patch attention. However, due to insufficient constraints on modeling such attention, we observe that the Localization Attention Maps (LAM) often struggle with the artifact issue, i.e., patch regions with minimal semantic relevance are falsely activated by class tokens. In this work, we propose MoRe to address this issue and further explore the potential of LAM. Our findings suggest that imposing additional regularization on class-patch attention is necessary. To this end, we first view the attention as a novel directed graph and propose the Graph Category Representation module to implicitly regularize the interaction among class-patch entities. It ensures that class tokens dynamically condense the related patch information and suppress unrelated artifacts at a graph level. Second, motivated by the observation that CAM from classification weights maintains smooth localization of objects, we devise the Localization-informed Regularization module to explicitly regularize the class-patch attention. It directly mines the token relations from CAM and further supervises the consistency between class and patch tokens in a learnable manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, validating that MoRe effectively addresses the artifact issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent single-stage and even multi-stage methods.

<p>Abstract: We present OmniVLM, a sub-billion-parameter vision-language model for efficient on-device inference. OmniVLM introduces a token compression mechanism that reduces visual token sequence length from 729 to 81 tokens, significantly reducing computational overhead while preserving visual-semantic fidelity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Chen, Wenbo Hu, Guande He, Zhijie Deng, Zheng Zhang, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual data for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization. Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications. Code and IDK dataset: https://github.com/hfutml/Calibration-MLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghao He, Hu Su, Haiyong Yu, Cong Yang, Wei Sui, Cong Wang, Song Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-set object detection (OSOD) is highly desirable for robotic manipulation in unstructured environments. However, existing OSOD methods often fail to meet the requirements of robotic applications due to their high computational burden and complex deployment. To address this issue, this paper proposes a light-weight framework called Decoupled OSOD (DOSOD), which is a practical and highly efficient solution to support real-time OSOD tasks in robotic systems. Specifically, DOSOD builds upon the YOLO-World pipeline by integrating a vision-language model (VLM) with a detector. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) adaptor is developed to transform text embeddings extracted by the VLM into a joint space, within which the detector learns the region representations of class-agnostic proposals. Cross-modality features are directly aligned in the joint space, avoiding the complex feature interactions and thereby improving computational efficiency. DOSOD operates like a traditional closed-set detector during the testing phase, effectively bridging the gap between closed-set and open-set detection. Compared to the baseline YOLO-World, the proposed DOSOD significantly enhances real-time performance while maintaining comparable accuracy. The slight DOSOD-S model achieves a Fixed AP of $26.7\%$, compared to $26.2\%$ for YOLO-World-v1-S and $22.7\%$ for YOLO-World-v2-S, using similar backbones on the LVIS minival dataset. Meanwhile, the FPS of DOSOD-S is $57.1\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v1-S and $29.6\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v2-S. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the DOSOD model facilitates the deployment of edge devices. The codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/D-Robotics-AI-Lab/DOSOD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Su, Zhineng Chen, Yongkun Du, Zhilong Ji, Kai Hu, Jinfeng Bai, Xieping Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Connected component (CC) is a proper text shape representation that aligns with human reading intuition. However, CC-based text detection methods have recently faced a developmental bottleneck that their time-consuming post-processing is difficult to eliminate. To address this issue, we introduce an explicit relational reasoning network (ERRNet) to elegantly model the component relationships without post-processing. Concretely, we first represent each text instance as multiple ordered text components, and then treat these components as objects in sequential movement. In this way, scene text detection can be innovatively viewed as a tracking problem. From this perspective, we design an end-to-end tracking decoder to achieve a CC-based method dispensing with post-processing entirely. Additionally, we observe that there is an inconsistency between classification confidence and localization quality, so we propose a Polygon Monte-Carlo method to quickly and accurately evaluate the localization quality. Based on this, we introduce a position-supervised classification loss to guide the task-aligned learning of ERRNet. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ERRNet. It consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while holding highly competitive inference speed.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14873">Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact: Self-incentive artifact removal for photoacoustic imaging without any data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Li, Qian Chen, Chulhong Kim, Seongwook Choi, Yibing Wang, Yu Zhang, Changhui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines optical contrast with the penetration depth of ultrasound, making it critical for clinical applications. However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifei Chen, Tianshuo Xu, Wenhang Ge, Leyi Wu, Dongyu Yan, Jing He, Luozhou Wang, Lu Zeng, Shunsi Zhang, Yingcong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Rendering and inverse rendering are pivotal tasks in both computer vision and graphics. The rendering equation is the core of the two tasks, as an ideal conditional distribution transfer function from intrinsic properties to RGB images. Despite achieving promising results of existing rendering methods, they merely approximate the ideal estimation for a specific scene and come with a high computational cost. Additionally, the inverse conditional distribution transfer is intractable due to the inherent ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven method that jointly models rendering and inverse rendering as two conditional generation tasks within a single diffusion framework. Inspired by UniDiffuser, we utilize two distinct time schedules to model both tasks, and with a tailored dual streaming module, we achieve cross-conditioning of two pre-trained diffusion models. This unified approach, named Uni-Renderer, allows the two processes to facilitate each other through a cycle-consistent constrain, mitigating ambiguity by enforcing consistency between intrinsic properties and rendered images. Combined with a meticulously prepared dataset, our method effectively decomposition of intrinsic properties and demonstrates a strong capability to recognize changes during rendering. We will open-source our training and inference code to the public, fostering further research and development in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pou-Chun Kung, Xianling Zhang, Katherine A. Skinner, Nikita Jaipuria</p>
<p>Abstract: Photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction plays an important role in autonomous driving, enabling the generation of novel data from existing datasets to simulate safety-critical scenarios and expand training data without additional acquisition costs. Gaussian Splatting (GS) facilitates real-time, photorealistic rendering with an explicit 3D Gaussian representation of the scene, providing faster processing and more intuitive scene editing than the implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). While extensive GS research has yielded promising advancements in autonomous driving applications, they overlook two critical aspects: First, existing methods mainly focus on low-speed and feature-rich urban scenes and ignore the fact that highway scenarios play a significant role in autonomous driving. Second, while LiDARs are commonplace in autonomous driving platforms, existing methods learn primarily from images and use LiDAR only for initial estimates or without precise sensor modeling, thus missing out on leveraging the rich depth information LiDAR offers and limiting the ability to synthesize LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a novel GS method for dynamic scene synthesis and editing with improved scene reconstruction through LiDAR supervision and support for LiDAR rendering. Unlike prior works that are tested mostly on urban datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus on the more challenging and highly relevant highway scenes for autonomous driving, with sparse sensor views and monotone backgrounds.

<p>Abstract: Recently, radar-camera fusion algorithms have gained significant attention as radar sensors provide geometric information that complements the limitations of cameras. However, most existing radar-camera depth estimation algorithms focus solely on improving performance, often neglecting computational efficiency. To address this gap, we propose LiRCDepth, a lightweight radar-camera depth estimation model. We incorporate knowledge distillation to enhance the training process, transferring critical information from a complex teacher model to our lightweight student model in three key domains. Firstly, low-level and high-level features are transferred by incorporating pixel-wise and pair-wise distillation. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware inter-depth distillation loss to refine intermediate depth maps during decoding. Leveraging our proposed knowledge distillation scheme, the lightweight model achieves a 6.6% improvement in MAE on the nuScenes dataset compared to the model trained without distillation.

<p>Abstract: Text-editable and pose-controllable character video generation is a challenging but prevailing topic with practical applications. However, existing approaches mainly focus on single-object video generation with pose guidance, ignoring the realistic situation that multi-character appear concurrently in a scenario. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-character video generation framework in a tuning-free manner, which is based on the separated text and pose guidance. Specifically, we first extract character masks from the pose sequence to identify the spatial position for each generating character, and then single prompts for each character are obtained with LLMs for precise text guidance. Moreover, the spatial-aligned cross attention and multi-branch control module are proposed to generate fine grained controllable multi-character video. The visualized results of generating video demonstrate the precise controllability of our method for multi-character generation. We also verify the generality of our method by applying it to various personalized T2I models. Moreover, the quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior performance compared with previous works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Shen, Shaohua Liu, Jiaqi Feng, Ziye Ma, Ning An</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) methods synthesize class-related features based on predefined class semantic prototypes, showcasing superior performance. However, this feature generation paradigm falls short of providing interpretable insights. In addition, existing approaches rely on semantic prototypes annotated by human experts, which exhibit a significant limitation in their scalability to generalized scenes. To overcome these deficiencies, a natural solution is to generate images for unseen classes using text prompts. To this end, We present DIG-ZSL, a novel Discriminative Image Generation framework for Zero-Shot Learning. Specifically, to ensure the generation of discriminative images for training an effective ZSL classifier, we learn a discriminative class token (DCT) for each unseen class under the guidance of a pre-trained category discrimination model (CDM). Harnessing DCTs, we can generate diverse and high-quality images, which serve as informative unseen samples for ZSL tasks. In this paper, the extensive experiments and visualizations on four datasets show that our DIG-ZSL: (1) generates diverse and high-quality images, (2) outperforms previous state-of-the-art nonhuman-annotated semantic prototype-based methods by a large margin, and (3) achieves comparable or better performance than baselines that leverage human-annotated semantic prototypes. The codes will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fa-Ting Hong, Zhan Xu, Haiyang Liu, Qinjie Lin, Luchuan Song, Zhixin Shu, Yang Zhou, Duygu Ceylan, Dan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based human animation aims to animate a human character based on a source human image as well as driving signals such as a sequence of poses. Leveraging the generative capacity of diffusion model, existing approaches are able to generate high-fidelity poses, but struggle with significant viewpoint changes, especially in zoom-in/zoom-out scenarios where camera-character distance varies. This limits the applications such as cinematic shot type plan or camera control. We propose a pose-correlated reference selection diffusion network, supporting substantial viewpoint variations in human animation. Our key idea is to enable the network to utilize multiple reference images as input, since significant viewpoint changes often lead to missing appearance details on the human body. To eliminate the computational cost, we first introduce a novel pose correlation module to compute similarities between non-aligned target and source poses, and then propose an adaptive reference selection strategy, utilizing the attention map to identify key regions for animation generation. To train our model, we curated a large dataset from public TED talks featuring varied shots of the same character, helping the model learn synthesis for different perspectives. Our experimental results show that with the same number of reference images, our model performs favorably compared to the current SOTA methods under large viewpoint change. We further show that the adaptive reference selection is able to choose the most relevant reference regions to generate humans under free viewpoints.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth usage of face recognition in people's daily life, face anti-spoofing becomes increasingly important to avoid malicious attacks. Recent face anti-spoofing models can reach a high classification accuracy on multiple datasets but these models can only tell people "this face is fake" while lacking the explanation to answer "why it is fake". Such a system undermines trustworthiness and causes user confusion, as it denies their requests without providing any explanations. In this paper, we incorporate XAI into face anti-spoofing and propose a new problem termed X-FAS (eXplainable Face Anti-Spoofing) empowering face anti-spoofing models to provide an explanation. We propose SPED (SPoofing Evidence Discovery), an X-FAS method which can discover spoof concepts and provide reliable explanations on the basis of discovered concepts. To evaluate the quality of X-FAS methods, we propose an X-FAS benchmark with annotated spoofing evidence by experts. We analyze SPED explanations on face anti-spoofing dataset and compare SPED quantitatively and qualitatively with previous XAI methods on proposed X-FAS benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate SPED's ability to generate reliable explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Ma, Guo-Sen Xie, Fang Zhao, Zechao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning aims to recognize novel concepts by leveraging prior knowledge learned from a few samples. However, for visually intensive tasks such as few-shot semantic segmentation, pixel-level annotations are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the more challenging image-level annotations and propose an adaptive frequency-aware network (AFANet) for weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS). Specifically, we first propose a cross-granularity frequency-aware module (CFM) that decouples RGB images into high-frequency and low-frequency distributions and further optimizes semantic structural information by realigning them. Unlike most existing WFSS methods using the textual information from the multi-modal language-vision model, e.g., CLIP, in an offline learning manner, we further propose a CLIP-guided spatial-adapter module (CSM), which performs spatial domain adaptive transformation on textual information through online learning, thus providing enriched cross-modal semantic information for CFM. Extensive experiments on the Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and COCO-20\textsuperscript{i} datasets demonstrate that AFANet has achieved state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ente Lin, Xujie Zhang, Fuwei Zhao, Yuxuan Luo, Xin Dong, Long Zeng, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models for garment-centric human generation from text or image prompts have garnered emerging attention for their great application potential. However, existing methods often face a dilemma: lightweight approaches, such as adapters, are prone to generate inconsistent textures; while finetune-based methods involve high training costs and struggle to maintain the generalization capabilities of pretrained diffusion models, limiting their performance across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose DreamFit, which incorporates a lightweight Anything-Dressing Encoder specifically tailored for the garment-centric human generation. DreamFit has three key advantages: (1) \textbf{Lightweight training}: with the proposed adaptive attention and LoRA modules, DreamFit significantly minimizes the model complexity to 83.4M trainable parameters. (2)\textbf{Anything-Dressing}: Our model generalizes surprisingly well to a wide range of (non-)garments, creative styles, and prompt instructions, consistently delivering high-quality results across diverse scenarios. (3) \textbf{Plug-and-play}: DreamFit is engineered for smooth integration with any community control plugins for diffusion models, ensuring easy compatibility and minimizing adoption barriers. To further enhance generation quality, DreamFit leverages pretrained large multi-modal models (LMMs) to enrich the prompt with fine-grained garment descriptions, thereby reducing the prompt gap between training and inference. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both $768 \times 512$ high-resolution benchmarks and in-the-wild images. DreamFit surpasses all existing methods, highlighting its state-of-the-art capabilities of garment-centric human generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Qian, Xin Yin, Dejing Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) empowered visual grounding typically rely on $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token as a text prompt to jointly optimize the vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) and the downstream task-specified model (\eg, SAM). However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works. In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Han, Haotian Fan, Jiachen Fu, Liang Li, Tao Li, Junhui Cui, Yunqiu Wang, Yang Tai, Jingwei Sun, Chunle Guo, Chongyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have achieved significant advancements. Correspondingly, many automated metrics have emerged to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of generative models. However, the performance comparison among these automated metrics is limited by existing small datasets. Additionally, these datasets lack the capacity to assess the performance of automated metrics at a fine-grained level. In this study, we contribute an EvalMuse-40K benchmark, gathering 40K image-text pairs with fine-grained human annotations for image-text alignment-related tasks. In the construction process, we employ various strategies such as balanced prompt sampling and data re-annotation to ensure the diversity and reliability of our benchmark. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of image-text alignment metrics for T2I models. Meanwhile, we introduce two new methods to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of T2I models: FGA-BLIP2 which involves end-to-end fine-tuning of a vision-language model to produce fine-grained image-text alignment scores and PN-VQA which adopts a novel positive-negative VQA manner in VQA models for zero-shot fine-grained evaluation. Both methods achieve impressive performance in image-text alignment evaluations. We also use our methods to rank current AIGC models, in which the results can serve as a reference source for future study and promote the development of T2I generation. The data and code will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18178">VisionGRU: A Linear-Complexity RNN Model for Efficient Image Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Yin, Kaixuan Yin, Weixing Chen, Enbo Huang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) are two dominant models for image analysis. While CNNs excel at extracting multi-scale features and ViTs effectively capture global dependencies, both suffer from high computational costs, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have attracted attention due to their efficiency. However, their performance in image classification tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, this paper introduces VisionGRU, a novel RNN-based architecture designed for efficient image classification. VisionGRU leverages a simplified Gated Recurrent Unit (minGRU) to process large-scale image features with linear complexity. It divides images into smaller patches and progressively reduces the sequence length while increasing the channel depth, thus facilitating multi-scale feature extraction. A hierarchical 2DGRU module with bidirectional scanning captures both local and global contexts, improving long-range dependency modeling, particularly for tasks like semantic segmentation. Experimental results on the ImageNet and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that VisionGRU outperforms ViTs, significantly reducing memory usage and computational costs, especially for high-resolution images. These findings underscore the potential of RNN-based approaches for developing efficient and scalable computer vision solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoping Wu, Jie Hu, Xiaoming Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatiana Zemskova, Dmitry Yudin</p>
<p>Abstract: A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model, storing information about the objects and the semantic relationships between them, making its use promising for robotic tasks. When interacting with a user, an embodied intelligent agent should be capable of responding to various queries about the scene formulated in natural language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for creating learnable representations of 3D scenes have demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of LLMs responses by adapting to the 3D world. However, the existing methods do not explicitly utilize information about the semantic relationships between objects, limiting themselves to information about their coordinates. In this work, we propose a method 3DGraphLLM for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph. The learnable representation is used as input for LLMs to perform 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, RIORefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of this approach over baseline methods that do not use information about the semantic relationships between objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Shen, Xiu-Shen Wei, Yifan Sun, Yuxin Song, Tao Yuan, Jian Jin, Heyang Xu, Yazhou Yao, Errui Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer Vision (CV) has yet to fully achieve the zero-shot task generalization observed in Natural Language Processing (NLP), despite following many of the milestones established in NLP, such as large transformer models, extensive pre-training, and the auto-regression paradigm, among others. In this paper, we explore the idea that CV adopts discrete and terminological task definitions (\eg, ``image segmentation''), which may be a key barrier to zero-shot task generalization. Our hypothesis is that without truly understanding previously-seen tasks--due to these terminological definitions--deep models struggle to generalize to novel tasks. To verify this, we introduce Explanatory Instructions, which provide an intuitive way to define CV task objectives through detailed linguistic transformations from input images to outputs. We create a large-scale dataset comprising 12 million ``image input $\to$ explanatory instruction $\to$ output'' triplets, and train an auto-regressive-based vision-language model (AR-based VLM) that takes both images and explanatory instructions as input. By learning to follow these instructions, the AR-based VLM achieves instruction-level zero-shot capabilities for previously-seen tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization for unseen CV tasks. Code and dataset will be openly available on our GitHub repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiao Ma, Jiayi Pan, Joyce Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to connect language units to their referents in the physical world, referred to as grounding, is crucial to learning and understanding grounded meanings of words. While humans demonstrate fast mapping in new word learning, it remains unclear whether modern vision-language models can truly represent language with their grounded meanings and how grounding may further bootstrap new word learning. To this end, we introduce Grounded Open Vocabulary Acquisition (GOVA) to examine grounding and bootstrapping in open-world language learning. As an initial attempt, we propose object-oriented BERT (OctoBERT), a novel visually-grounded language model by pre-training on image-text pairs highlighting grounding as an objective. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that OctoBERT is a more coherent and fast grounded word learner, and that the grounding ability acquired during pre-training helps the model to learn unseen words more rapidly and robustly.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamidreza Behjoo, Michael Chertkov</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate diffusion models generating synthetic samples from the probability distribution represented by the Ground Truth (GT) samples. We focus on how GT sample information is encoded in the Score Function (SF), computed (not simulated) from the Wiener-Ito (WI) linear forward process in the artifical time $t\in [0\to \infty]$, and then used as a nonlinear drift in the simulated WI reverse process with $t\in [\infty\to 0]$. We propose U-Turn diffusion, an augmentation of a pre-trained diffusion model, which shortens the forward and reverse processes to $t\in [0\to T_u]$ and $t\in [T_u\to 0]$. The U-Turn reverse process is initialized at $T_u$ with a sample from the probability distribution of the forward process (initialized at $t=0$ with a GT sample) ensuring a detailed balance relation between the shorten forward and reverse processes. Our experiments on the class-conditioned SF of the ImageNet dataset and the multi-class, single SF of the CIFAR-10 dataset reveal a critical Memorization Time $ T_m $, beyond which generated samples diverge from the GT sample used to initialize the U-Turn scheme, and a Speciation Time $ T_s $, where for $ T_u > T_s > T_m $, samples begin representing different classes. We further examine the role of SF non-linearity through a Gaussian Test, comparing empirical and Gaussian-approximated U-Turn auto-correlation functions, and showing that the SF becomes effectively affine for $ t > T_s $, and approximately affine for $t\in [T_m,T_s]$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjie Fu, Huandong Wang, Liyuan Zhang, Chen Gao, Yong Li, Tao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Membership Inference Attack (MIA) identifies whether a record exists in a machine learning model's training set by querying the model. MIAs on the classic classification models have been well-studied, and recent works have started to explore how to transplant MIA onto generative models. Our investigation indicates that existing MIAs designed for generative models mainly depend on the overfitting in target models. However, overfitting can be avoided by employing various regularization techniques, whereas existing MIAs demonstrate poor performance in practice. Unlike overfitting, memorization is essential for deep learning models to attain optimal performance, making it a more prevalent phenomenon. Memorization in generative models leads to an increasing trend in the probability distribution of generating records around the member record. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Fluctuation Assessing Membership Inference Attack (PFAMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by detecting these trends via analyzing the overall probabilistic fluctuations around given records. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple generative models and datasets, which demonstrate PFAMI can improve the attack success rate (ASR) by about 27.9% when compared with the best baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiang Lin, Yaping Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Data augmentation methods are commonly integrated into the training of anomaly detection models. Previous approaches have primarily focused on replicating real-world anomalies or enhancing diversity, without considering that the standard of anomaly varies across different classes, potentially leading to a biased training distribution. This paper analyzes crucial traits of simulated anomalies that contribute to the training of reconstructive networks and condenses them into several methods, thus creating a comprehensive framework by selectively utilizing appropriate combinations. Furthermore, we integrate this framework with a reconstruction-based approach and concurrently propose a split training strategy that alleviates the issue of overfitting while avoiding introducing interference to the reconstruction process. The evaluations conducted on the MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach, particularly in terms of object classes. To evaluate generalizability, we generate a simulated dataset comprising anomalies with diverse characteristics since the original test samples only include specific types of anomalies and may lead to biased evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits promising potential for generalizing effectively to various unforeseen anomalies encountered in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Object-centric architectures usually apply a differentiable module to the entire feature map to decompose it into sets of entity representations called slots. Some of these methods structurally resemble clustering algorithms, where the cluster's center in latent space serves as a slot representation. Slot Attention is an example of such a method, acting as a learnable analog of the soft k-means algorithm. Our work employs a learnable clustering method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model. Unlike other approaches, we represent slots not only as centers of clusters but also incorporate information about the distance between clusters and assigned vectors, leading to more expressive slot representations. Our experiments demonstrate that using this approach instead of Slot Attention improves performance in object-centric scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results in the set property prediction task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Li, Xiu Su, Yu Han, Shan You, Tao Huang, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in various generative tasks with the predictive prowess of denoising model. Currently, diffusion models employ a uniform denoising model across all timesteps. However, the inherent variations in data distributions at different timesteps lead to conflicts during training, constraining the potential of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-stage divide-and-conquer training strategy termed TDC Training. It groups timesteps based on task similarity and difficulty, assigning highly customized denoising models to each group, thereby enhancing the performance of diffusion models. While two-stage training avoids the need to train each model separately, the total training cost is even lower than training a single unified denoising model. Additionally, we introduce Proxy-based Pruning to further customize the denoising models. This method transforms the pruning problem of diffusion models into a multi-round decision-making problem, enabling precise pruning of diffusion models. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of TDC Training, demonstrating improvements in FID of 1.5 on ImageNet64 compared to original IDDPM, while saving about 20\% of computational resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) is a collection of techniques designed to automate the machine learning development process. While traditional AutoML approaches have been successfully applied in several critical steps of model development (e.g. hyperparameter optimization), there lacks a AutoML system that automates the entire end-to-end model production workflow for computer vision. To fill this blank, we propose a novel request-to-model task, which involves understanding the user's natural language request and execute the entire workflow to output production-ready models. This empowers non-expert individuals to easily build task-specific models via a user-friendly language interface. To facilitate development and evaluation, we develop a new experimental platform called AutoMMLab and a new benchmark called LAMP for studying key components in the end-to-end request-to-model pipeline. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is one of the most important components for AutoML. Traditional approaches mostly rely on trial-and-error, leading to inefficient parameter search. To solve this problem, we propose a novel LLM-based HPO algorithm, called HPO-LLaMA. Equipped with extensive knowledge and experience in model hyperparameter tuning, HPO-LLaMA achieves significant improvement of HPO efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huajun Zhou, Fengtao Zhou, Hao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed impressive achievements in cancer survival analysis by integrating multimodal data, e.g., pathology images and genomic profiles. However, the heterogeneity and high dimensionality of these modalities pose significant challenges for extracting discriminative representations while maintaining good generalization. In this paper, we propose a Cohort-individual Cooperative Learning (CCL) framework to advance cancer survival analysis by collaborating knowledge decomposition and cohort guidance. Specifically, first, we propose a Multimodal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) module to explicitly decompose multimodal knowledge into four distinct components: redundancy, synergy and uniqueness of the two modalities. Such a comprehensive decomposition can enlighten the models to perceive easily overlooked yet important information, facilitating an effective multimodal fusion. Second, we propose a Cohort Guidance Modeling (CGM) to mitigate the risk of overfitting task-irrelevant information. It can promote a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the underlying multimodal data, while avoiding the pitfalls of overfitting and enhancing the generalization ability of the model. By cooperating the knowledge decomposition and cohort guidance methods, we develop a robust multimodal survival analysis model with enhanced discrimination and generalization abilities. Extensive experimental results on five cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in integrating multimodal data for survival analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become the de-facto approach for generating visual data, which are trained to match the distribution of the training dataset. In addition, we also want to control generation to fulfill desired properties such as alignment to a text description, which can be specified with a black-box reward function. Prior works fine-tune pretrained diffusion models to achieve this goal through reinforcement learning-based algorithms. Nonetheless, they suffer from issues including slow credit assignment as well as low quality in their generated samples. In this work, we explore techniques that do not directly maximize the reward but rather generate high-reward images with relatively high probability -- a natural scenario for the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). To this end, we propose the Diffusion Alignment with GFlowNet (DAG) algorithm to post-train diffusion models with black-box property functions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion and various reward specifications corroborate that our method could effectively align large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with given reward information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongjie Si, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of large foundation models within the pre-training and fine-tuning framework has underscored that larger models often yield better results. However, the scaling up of large foundation models has led to soaring costs in fine-tuning and parameter storage, rendering extensive adaptations impractical. This challenge has sparked the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on optimizing a select subset of parameters while keeping the rest fixed, significantly lowering computational and storage overheads. While recent years have witnessed a significant success in PEFT, a deep understanding of the fundamental principles behind these methods remains unexplored. To this end, here we take the first step to unify all approaches by dissecting them from a decomposition perspective. We initiate a comprehensive mathematical analysis of these methods, allowing us to delve deeply into their underlying mechanisms, and we explore the reasons behind the variations in performance among different techniques. Furthermore, inspired by our theoretical analysis, we introduce two novel PEFT methods alongside a simple yet effective framework designed to enhance the performance of PEFT techniques across various applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Chen, Michael F. Bonner</p>
<p>Abstract: Do neural network models of vision learn brain-aligned representations because they share architectural constraints and task objectives with biological vision or because they learn universal features of natural image processing? We characterized the universality of hundreds of thousands of representational dimensions from visual neural networks with varied construction. We found that networks with varied architectures and task objectives learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite appearing highly distinct at a surface level. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with fMRI, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network's specific characteristics. Remarkably, each network can be reduced to fewer than ten of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the human brain. These results suggest that the underlying similarities between artificial and biological vision are primarily governed by a core set of universal image representations that are convergently learned by diverse systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Wang, Huijie Zhang, Zekai Zhang, Siyi Chen, Yi Ma, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that diffusion models can effectively learn the image distribution and generate new samples. Remarkably, these models can achieve this even with a small number of training samples despite a large image dimension, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by leveraging key empirical observations: (i) the low intrinsic dimensionality of image data, (ii) a union of manifold structure of image data, and (iii) the low-rank property of the denoising autoencoder in trained diffusion models. These observations motivate us to assume the underlying data distribution of image data as a mixture of low-rank Gaussians and to parameterize the denoising autoencoder as a low-rank model according to the score function of the assumed distribution. With these setups, we rigorously show that optimizing the training loss of diffusion models is equivalent to solving the canonical subspace clustering problem over the training samples. Based on this equivalence, we further show that the minimal number of samples required to learn the underlying distribution scales linearly with the intrinsic dimensions under the above data and model assumptions. This insight sheds light on why diffusion models can break the curse of dimensionality and exhibit the phase transition in learning distributions. Moreover, we empirically establish a correspondence between the subspaces and the semantic representations of image data, facilitating image editing. We validate these results with corroborated experimental results on both simulated distributions and image datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Wang, Yafei Ou, Prasoon Ambalathankandy, Gen Ota, Pengyu Dai, Masayuki Ikebe, Kenji Suzuki, Tamotsu Kamishima</p>
<p>Abstract: Conventional radiography is the widely used imaging technology in diagnosing, monitoring, and prognosticating musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases because of its easy availability, versatility, and cost-effectiveness. In conventional radiographs, bone overlaps are prevalent, and can impede the accurate assessment of bone characteristics by radiologists or algorithms, posing significant challenges to conventional and computer-aided diagnoses. This work initiated the study of a challenging scenario - bone layer separation in conventional radiographs, in which separate overlapped bone regions enable the independent assessment of the bone characteristics of each bone layer and lay the groundwork for MSK disease diagnosis and its automation. This work proposed a Bone Layer Separation GAN (BLS-GAN) framework that can produce high-quality bone layer images with reasonable bone characteristics and texture. This framework introduced a reconstructor based on conventional radiography imaging principles, which achieved efficient reconstruction and mitigates the recurrent calculations and training instability issues caused by soft tissue in the overlapped regions. Additionally, pre-training with synthetic images was implemented to enhance the stability of both the training process and the results. The generated images passed the visual Turing test, and improved performance in downstream tasks. This work affirms the feasibility of extracting bone layer images from conventional radiographs, which holds promise for leveraging bone layer separation technology to facilitate more comprehensive analytical research in MSK diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Xu, Bowen Hai, Yushun Tang, Zhihai He</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) models have achieved superior rate-distortion performance than traditional codecs. Existing LIC models use CNN, Transformer, or Mixed CNN-Transformer as basic blocks. However, limited by the shifted window attention, Swin-Transformer-based LIC exhibits a restricted growth of receptive fields, affecting the ability to model large objects for image compression. To address this issue and improve the performance, we incorporate window partition into channel attention for the first time to obtain large receptive fields and capture more global information. Since channel attention hinders local information learning, it is important to extend existing attention mechanisms in Transformer codecs to the space-channel attention to establish multiple receptive fields, being able to capture global correlations with large receptive fields while maintaining detailed characterization of local correlations with small receptive fields. We also incorporate the discrete wavelet transform into our Spatial-Channel Hybrid (SCH) framework for efficient frequency-dependent down-sampling and further enlarging receptive fields. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances, reducing BD-rate by 18.54%, 23.98%, 22.33%, and 24.71% on four standard datasets compared to VTM-23.1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Kosuke Nishida</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent concept-based interpretable models have succeeded in providing meaningful explanations by pre-defined concept sets. However, the dependency on the pre-defined concepts restricts the application because of the limited number of concepts for explanations. This paper proposes a novel interpretable deep neural network called explanation bottleneck models (XBMs). XBMs generate a text explanation from the input without pre-defined concepts and then predict a final task prediction based on the generated explanation by leveraging pre-trained vision-language encoder-decoder models. To achieve both the target task performance and the explanation quality, we train XBMs through the target task loss with the regularization penalizing the explanation decoder via the distillation from the frozen pre-trained decoder. Our experiments, including a comparison to state-of-the-art concept bottleneck models, confirm that XBMs provide accurate and fluent natural language explanations without pre-defined concept sets.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04000">Multiscale Latent Diffusion Model for Enhanced Feature Extraction from Medical Images</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabeya Tus Sadia, Jie Zhang, Jin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Various imaging modalities are used in patient diagnosis, each offering unique advantages and valuable insights into anatomy and pathology. Computed Tomography (CT) is crucial in diagnostics, providing high-resolution images for precise internal organ visualization. CT's ability to detect subtle tissue variations is vital for diagnosing diseases like lung cancer, enabling early detection and accurate tumor assessment. However, variations in CT scanner models and acquisition protocols introduce significant variability in the extracted radiomic features, even when imaging the same patient. This variability poses considerable challenges for downstream research and clinical analysis, which depend on consistent and reliable feature extraction. Current methods for medical image feature extraction, often based on supervised learning approaches, including GAN-based models, face limitations in generalizing across different imaging environments. In response to these challenges, we propose LTDiff++, a multiscale latent diffusion model designed to enhance feature extraction in medical imaging. The model addresses variability by standardizing non-uniform distributions in the latent space, improving feature consistency. LTDiff++ utilizes a UNet++ encoder-decoder architecture coupled with a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) at the latent bottleneck to achieve robust feature extraction and standardization. Extensive empirical evaluations on both patient and phantom CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements in image standardization, with higher Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCC) across multiple radiomic feature categories. Through these advancements, LTDiff++ represents a promising solution for overcoming the inherent variability in medical imaging data, offering improved reliability and accuracy in feature extraction processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Wang, Yung Hsin Chen, Aladine Chetouani, Fabian Bauer, Yuhua Ru, Fang Chen, Liping Zhang, Rachid Jennane, Mohamed Jarraya</p>
<p>Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, often diagnosed using X-rays due to its cost-effectiveness. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides superior soft tissue visualization and serves as a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool, its high cost and limited accessibility significantly restrict its widespread use. To explore the feasibility of bridging this imaging gap, we conducted a feasibility study leveraging a diffusion-based model that uses an X-ray image as conditional input, alongside target depth and additional patient-specific feature information, to generate corresponding MRI sequences. Our findings demonstrate that the MRI volumes generated by our approach is visually closer to real MRI scans. Moreover, increasing inference steps enhances the continuity and smoothness of the synthesized MRI sequences. Through ablation studies, we further validate that integrating supplementary patient-specific information, beyond what X-rays alone can provide, enhances the accuracy and clinical relevance of the generated MRI, which underscores the potential of leveraging external patient-specific information to improve the MRI generation.

<p>Abstract: The salient multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o highlight its critical role in practical applications, yet it lacks a high-performing open-source counterpart. In this paper, we introduce Baichuan-omni, the first open-source 7B Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, audio, and text, while delivering an advanced multimodal interactive experience and strong performance. We propose an effective multimodal training schema starting with 7B model and proceeding through two stages of multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning across audio, image, video, and text modal. This approach equips the language model with the ability to handle visual and audio data effectively. Demonstrating strong performance across various omni-modal and multimodal benchmarks, we aim for this contribution to serve as a competitive baseline for the open-source community in advancing multimodal understanding and real-time interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Wan, Qi Zheng, Yibo Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional and neural video codecs commonly encounter limitations in controllability and generality under ultra-low-bitrate coding scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose M3-CVC, a controllable video compression framework incorporating multimodal generative models. The framework utilizes a semantic-motion composite strategy for keyframe selection to retain critical information. For each keyframe and its corresponding video clip, a dialogue-based large multimodal model (LMM) approach extracts hierarchical spatiotemporal details, enabling both inter-frame and intra-frame representations for improved video fidelity while enhancing encoding interpretability. M3-CVC further employs a conditional diffusion-based, text-guided keyframe compression method, achieving high fidelity in frame reconstruction. During decoding, textual descriptions derived from LMMs guide the diffusion process to restore the original video's content accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that M3-CVC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VVC standard in ultra-low bitrate scenarios, particularly in preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Zhao, Ruifeng Chen, Jing Yan, Juan Feng, Jun Xiang, Yang Chen, Dong Liang, Yinsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To shorten the door-to-puncture time for better treating patients with acute ischemic stroke, it is highly desired to obtain quantitative cerebral perfusion images using C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) equipped in the interventional suite. However, limited by the slow gantry rotation speed, the temporal resolution and temporal sampling density of typical C-arm CBCT are much poorer than those of multi-detector-row CT in the diagnostic imaging suite. The current quantitative perfusion imaging includes two cascaded steps: time-resolved image reconstruction and perfusion parametric estimation. For time-resolved image reconstruction, the technical challenge imposed by poor temporal resolution and poor sampling density causes inaccurate quantification of the temporal variation of cerebral artery and tissue attenuation values. For perfusion parametric estimation, it remains a technical challenge to appropriately design the handcrafted regularization for better solving the associated deconvolution problem. These two challenges together prevent obtaining quantitatively accurate perfusion images using C-arm CBCT. The purpose of this work is to simultaneously address these two challenges by combining the two cascaded steps into a single joint optimization problem and reconstructing quantitative perfusion images directly from the measured sinogram data. In the developed direct cerebral perfusion parametric image reconstruction technique, TRAINER in short, the quantitative perfusion images have been represented as a subject-specific conditional generative model trained under the constraint of the time-resolved CT forward model, perfusion convolutional model, and the subject's own measured sinogram data. Results shown in this paper demonstrated that using TRAINER, quantitative cerebral perfusion images can be accurately obtained using C-arm CBCT in the interventional suite.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate predictions and representations of plant growth patterns in simulated and controlled environments are important for addressing various challenges in plant phenomics research. This review explores various works on state-of-the-art predictive pattern recognition techniques, focusing on the spatiotemporal modeling of plant traits and the integration of dynamic environmental interactions. We provide a comprehensive examination of deterministic, probabilistic, and generative modeling approaches, emphasizing their applications in high-throughput phenotyping and simulation-based plant growth forecasting. Key topics include regressions and neural network-based representation models for the task of forecasting, limitations of existing experiment-based deterministic approaches, and the need for dynamic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty and evolving environmental feedback. This review surveys advances in 2D and 3D structured data representations through functional-structural plant models and conditional generative models. We offer a perspective on opportunities for future works, emphasizing the integration of domain-specific knowledge to data-driven methods, improvements to available datasets, and the implementation of these techniques toward real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchun Qin, Pengfei Fang, Hui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continuously introduce novel categories into a classification system without forgetting previously learned ones, thus adapting to evolving data distributions. Researchers are currently focusing on leveraging the rich semantic information of pre-trained models (PTMs) in CIL tasks. Prompt learning has been adopted in CIL for its ability to adjust data distribution to better align with pre-trained knowledge. This paper critically examines the limitations of existing methods from the perspective of prompt learning, which heavily rely on input information. To address this issue, we propose a novel PTM-based CIL method called Input-Agnostic Prompt Enhancement with Negative Feedback Regulation (PEARL). In PEARL, we implement an input-agnostic global prompt coupled with an adaptive momentum update strategy to reduce the model's dependency on data distribution, thereby effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Guided by negative feedback regulation, this adaptive momentum update addresses the parameter sensitivity inherent in fixed-weight momentum updates. Furthermore, it fosters the continuous enhancement of the prompt for new tasks by harnessing correlations between different tasks in CIL. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/qinyongchun/PEARL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibo Yang, Justus C. Will, Stephan Mandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved mainstream success in many generative modeling tasks, from image generation to inverse problem solving. A distinct feature of these models is that they correspond to deep hierarchical latent variable models optimizing a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the data likelihood. Drawing on a basic connection between likelihood modeling and compression, we explore the potential of diffusion models for progressive coding, resulting in a sequence of bits that can be incrementally transmitted and decoded with progressively improving reconstruction quality. Unlike prior work based on Gaussian diffusion or conditional diffusion models, we propose a new form of diffusion model with uniform noise in the forward process, whose negative ELBO corresponds to the end-to-end compression cost using universal quantization. We obtain promising first results on image compression, achieving competitive rate-distortion and rate-realism results on a wide range of bit-rates with a single model, bringing neural codecs a step closer to practical deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghan He, Kuan Zhu, Haiyun Guo, Junfeng Fang, Zhenglin Hua, Yuheng Jia, Ming Tang, Tat-Seng Chua, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Shi, Xiaochuang Han, Chunting Zhou, Weixin Liang, Xi Victoria Lin, Luke Zettlemoyer, Lili Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present LMFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.</p>
