<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke can inform clinical decision-making and resource allocation. Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction. Our findings support the development of text-based prognostic tools that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows without manual data extraction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in foundational models have yielded reasoning systems capable of achieving a gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad. The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results. We conclude with reflections on human-AI collaboration in mathematics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin R. Redhead, Thomas L. Lee, Peng Gu, V\'ictor Elvira, Amos Storkey</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is increasingly critical across high-stakes domains, from finance and epidemiology to climate science. However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Truong Minh Huy, Edward Hirst</p>
<p>Abstract: A novel sequence architecture design is introduced, Versor, which uses Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) in place of the traditional fundamental non-linear operations to achieve structural generalization and significant performance improvements on a variety of tasks, while offering improved interpretability and efficiency. By embedding states in the $Cl_{4,1}$ manifold and evolving them via geometric transformations (rotors), Versor natively represents $SE(3)$-equivariant relationships without requiring explicit structural encoding. Versor is validated on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and standard multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103), consistently outperforming Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN). Key results include: orders of magnitude fewer parameters ($200\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (99.3% MCC on topology vs. 50.4% for ViT); and $O(L)$ linear complexity via the novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels achieve up to $78\times$ speedup, providing a scalable foundation for geometrically-aware scientific modeling.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10204">Adaptive Optimization via Momentum on Variance-Normalized Gradients</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco Patitucci, Aryan Mokhtari</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MVN-Grad (Momentum on Variance-Normalized Gradients), an Adam-style optimizer that improves stability and performance by combining two complementary ideas: variance-based normalization and momentum applied after normalization. MVN-Grad scales each coordinate by an exponential moving average of gradient uncertainty and applies momentum to the resulting normalized gradients, eliminating the cross-time coupling between stale momentum and a stochastic normalizer present in standard Adam-type updates. We prove that this decoupling yields strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize variance methods under standard noise assumptions, and that MVN-Grad is robust to outliers: it has a uniformly bounded response to single gradient spikes.
  In low-variance regimes, we further show variance normalization avoids sign-type collapse associated with second-moment scaling and can yield accelerated convergence. Across CIFAR-100 image classification and GPT-style language modeling benchmarks, MVN-Grad matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp, delivering smoother training and improved generalization with no added overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitry S. Ageev, Yulia A. Ageeva</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a neural-network construction of Euclidean scalar quantum field theories from transformer attention heads, defining $n$-point correlators by averaging over random network parameters in the NN-QFT framework. For a single attention head, shared random softmax weights couple different width coordinates and induce non-Gaussian field statistics that persist in the infinite-width limit $d_k\to\infty$. We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an "independence-breaking" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width. Finally, we show that summing many independent heads with standard $1/N_h$ normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as $1/N_h$, yielding a Gaussian NN-QFT in the large-head limit.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10210">How Much Reasoning Do Retrieval-Augmented Models Add beyond LLMs? A Benchmarking Framework for Multi-Hop Inference over Hybrid Knowledge</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhong Lin, Bing Zhang, Song Wang, Ziyan Liu, Dan Gutfreund, Julian Shun, Yada Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with knowledge-intensive questions that require up-to-date information and multi-hop reasoning. Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems. We release our code and data at github.com/junhongmit/HybridRAG-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Rushka, Diego Klabjan</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous empirical studies have shown that LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full-parameter methods on downstream fine-tuning tasks, even for rank-1 updates. By contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of the dependence of LoRA's accuracy on update rank remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we compare the accuracy of rank-r LoRA updates against full-parameter updates for fine-tuning tasks from a dynamical systems perspective. We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates. We then use the resulting dynamical system equations to obtain closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10216">ELROND: Exploring and decomposing intrinsic capabilities of diffusion models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pawe{\l} Skier\'s, Tomasz Trzci\'nski, Kamil Deja</p>
<p>Abstract: A single text prompt passed to a diffusion model often yields a wide range of visual outputs determined solely by stochastic process, leaving users with no direct control over which specific semantic variations appear in the image. While existing unsupervised methods attempt to analyze these variations via output features, they omit the underlying generative process. In this work, we propose a framework to disentangle these semantic directions directly within the input embedding space. To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob L. Block, Mehryar Mohri, Aryan Mokhtari, Sanjay Shakkottai</p>
<p>Abstract: We study machine unlearning in large generative models by framing the task as density ratio estimation to a target distribution rather than supervised fine-tuning. While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on the TOFU benchmark show that T3-Unlearning improves forget quality and generative utility over existing baselines, while training only a fraction of the parameters with a minimal runtime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiting Huang, Zecheng Li, Yu Zeng, Qingnan Ren, Zhen Fang, Qisheng Su, Kou Shi, Lin Chen, Zehui Chen, Feng Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10226">Self-Evolving Recommendation System: End-To-End Autonomous Model Optimization With LLM Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Wang, Yi Wu, Daryl Chang, Li Wei, Lukasz Heldt</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing large-scale machine learning systems, such as recommendation models for global video platforms, requires navigating a massive hyperparameter search space and, more critically, designing sophisticated optimizers, architectures, and reward functions to capture nuanced user behaviors. Achieving substantial improvements in these areas is a non-trivial task, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations to test new hypotheses. We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Asiaee, Chao Yan, Zachary B. Abrams, Bradley A. Malin</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides a mathematical guarantee limiting what an adversary can learn about any individual from released data. However, achieving this protection typically requires adding noise, and noise can accumulate when many statistics are measured. Existing DP synthetic data methods treat all features symmetrically, spreading noise uniformly even when the data will serve a specific prediction task.
  We develop a prediction-centric approach operating in three regimes depending on available structural knowledge. In the causal regime, when the causal parents of $Y$ are known and distribution shift is expected, we target the parents for robustness. In the graphical regime, when a Bayesian network structure is available and the distribution is stable, the Markov blanket of $Y$ provides a sufficient feature set for optimal prediction. In the predictive regime, when no structural knowledge exists, we select features via differentially private methods without claiming to recover causal or graphical structure.
  We formalize this as PRISM, a mechanism that (i) identifies a predictive feature subset according to the appropriate regime, (ii) constructs targeted summary statistics, (iii) allocates budget to minimize an upper bound on prediction error, and (iv) synthesizes data via graphical-model inference. We prove end-to-end privacy guarantees and risk bounds. Empirically, task-aware allocation improves prediction accuracy compared to generic synthesizers. Under distribution shift, targeting causal parents achieves AUC $\approx 0.73$ while correlation-based selection collapses to chance ($\approx 0.49$).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joesph An, Phillip Keung, Jiaqi Wang, Orevaoghene Ahia, Noah A. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Large audio language models are increasingly used for complex audio understanding tasks, but they struggle with temporal tasks that require precise temporal grounding, such as word alignment and speaker diarization. The standard approach, where we generate timestamps as sequences of text tokens, is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially when processing audio lengths outside the model's training distribution. In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines. Most notably, it achieves a >50x inference speedup and demonstrates robust length generalization, maintaining high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard token-based models collapse completely.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Pavlenko, Alexander Golubev, Simon Karasik, Boris Yangel</p>
<p>Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) assigns a single scalar advantage to all tokens in a completion. For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts.</p>

Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.
  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's "outlierness"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.
  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Eduardo P. Silva, Jo\~ao Pedro M. Sena, Julio C. S. Reis, Andr\'e G. Santos, Lucas N. Ferreira</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system that models students' programming skills using embeddings of the source code they submit throughout a course. These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Shi, Jian Kang, Yi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Kernel methods have been extensively utilized in machine learning for classification and prediction tasks due to their ability to capture complex non-linear data patterns. However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism. We have applied it to a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, predicting binary outcomes of ICU escalation and extracting clinically meaningful features, underscoring the practical utility of this approach in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanta Yamaoka, Sumantrak Mukherjee, Thomas G\"artner, David Antony Selby, Stefan Konigorski, Eyke H\"ullermeier, Viktor Bengs, Sebastian Josef Vollmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in identifying qualitative causal relations, but their ability to perform quantitative causal reasoning -- estimating effect sizes that parametrize functional relationships -- remains underexplored in continuous domains. We introduce Linear-LLM-SCM, a plug-and-play benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs on linear Gaussian structural causal model (SCM) parametrization when the DAG is given. The framework decomposes a DAG into local parent-child sets and prompts an LLM to produce a regression-style structural equation per node, which is aggregated and compared against available ground-truth parameters. Our experiments show several challenges in such benchmarking tasks, namely, strong stochasticity in the results in some of the models and susceptibility to DAG misspecification via spurious edges in the continuous domains. Across models, we observe substantial variability in coefficient estimates for some settings and sensitivity to structural and semantic perturbations, highlighting current limitations of LLMs as quantitative causal parameterizers. We also open-sourced the benchmarking framework so that researchers can utilize their DAGs and any off-the-shelf LLMs plug-and-play for evaluation in their domains effortlessly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rattana Pukdee, Maria-Florina Balcan, Pradeep Ravikumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Pairwise preference learning is central to machine learning, with recent applications in aligning language models with human preferences. A typical dataset consists of triplets $(x, y^+, y^-)$, where response $y^+$ is preferred over response $y^-$ for context $x$. The Bradley--Terry (BT) model is the predominant approach, modeling preference probabilities as a function of latent score differences. Standard practice assumes data follows this model and learns the latent scores accordingly. However, real data may violate this assumption, and it remains unclear what BT learning recovers in such cases. Starting from triplet comparison data, we formalize the preference information it encodes through the conditional preference distribution (CPRD). We give precise conditions for when BT is appropriate for modeling the CPRD, and identify factors governing sample efficiency -- namely, margin and connectivity. Together, these results offer a data-centric foundation for understanding what preference learning actually recovers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaqing Zhang, Kaiyue Wen, Tengyu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Researchers build scaling laws to forecast the training performance of expensive large-scale runs with larger model size N and data size D. These laws assume that other training hyperparameters are optimally chosen, which can require significant effort and, in some cases, be impossible due to external hardware constraints. To improve predictability across a broader set of hyperparameters and enable simpler tuning at scale, we propose learning a \textit{Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law} (CPL): a mapping from the \textit{full training configuration} to training performance. Because no simple functional form can express this mapping, we parameterize it with a large language model (LLM), and fit it with diverse open-source pretraining logs across multiple sources, yielding a \textit{Neural} Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL). NCPL accurately predicts how training configurations influence the final pretraining loss, achieving 20-40% lower prediction error than the configuration-agnostic Chinchilla law and generalizing to runs using up to 10 x more compute than any run in the training set. It further supports joint tuning of multiple hyperparameters with performance comparable to hyperparameter scaling law baselines. Finally, NCPL naturally and effectively extends to richer prediction targets such as loss-curve prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoling Wang, Lang Zeng, Tao Sun, Youngjoo Cho, Ying Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting time-to-event outcomes when event times are interval censored is challenging because the exact event time is unobserved. Many existing survival analysis approaches for interval-censored data rely on strong model assumptions or cannot handle high-dimensional predictors. We develop ICODEN, an ordinary differential equation-based neural network for interval-censored data that models the hazard function through deep neural networks and obtains the cumulative hazard by solving an ordinary differential equation. ICODEN does not require the proportional hazards assumption or a prespecified parametric form for the hazard function, thereby permitting flexible survival modeling. Across simulation settings with proportional or non-proportional hazards and both linear and nonlinear covariate effects, ICODEN consistently achieves satisfactory predictive accuracy and remains stable as the number of predictors increases. Applications to data from multiple phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and to two Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS and AREDS2) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) demonstrate ICODEN's robust prediction performance. In both applications, predicting time-to-AD or time-to-late AMD, ICODEN effectively uses hundreds to more than 1,000 SNPs and supports data-driven subgroup identification with differential progression risk profiles. These results establish ICODEN as a practical assumption-lean tool for prediction with interval-censored survival data in high-dimensional biomedical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateo Juliani, Mingxuan Li, Elias Bareinboim</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward shaping has been applied widely to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents' training. However, a principled way of designing effective reward shaping functions, especially for complex continuous control problems, remains largely under-explained. In this work, we propose to automatically learn a reward shaping function for continuous control problems from offline datasets, potentially contaminated by unobserved confounding variables. Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders. More broadly, our work marks a solid first step towards confounding robust continuous control from a causal perspective. Code for training our reward shaping functions can be found at https://github.com/mateojuliani/confounding_robust_cont_control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lipai Huang, Kai Yin, Chia-Fu Liu, Ali Mostafavi</p>
<p>Abstract: R2RAG-Flood is a reasoning-reinforced, training-free retrieval-augmented generation framework for post-storm property damage nowcasting. Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyeon Kim, Jonathan Geuter, David Alvarez-Melis, Sham Kakade, Sitan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces. By generating sequences in any order and allowing for parallel decoding, they enable fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, this flexibility comes with a training complexity trade-off: MDMs train on an exponentially large set of masking patterns, which is not only computationally expensive, but also creates a train--test mismatch between the random masks used in training and the highly structured masks induced by inference-time unmasking. In this work, we propose Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA), a simple modification of the forward masking process that aligns training-time and inference-time masking patterns, thereby focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks and speeding up training. Empirically, PUMA speeds up pretraining at the 125M scale by $\approx 2.5\times$ and offers complementary advantages on top of common recipes like autoregressive initialization. We open-source our codebase at https://github.com/JaeyeonKim01/PUMA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaydeep Chauhan, Mark Seidman, Pezhman Raeisian Parvari, Zhi Zheng, Zina Ben-Miled, Cristina Barboi, Andrew Gonzalez, Malaz Boustani</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a scalable, AI-powered system that identifies and extracts evidence-based behavioral nudges from unstructured biomedical literature. Nudges are subtle, non-coercive interventions that influence behavior without limiting choice, showing strong impact on health outcomes like medication adherence. However, identifying these interventions from PubMed's 8 million+ articles is a bottleneck. Our system uses a novel multi-stage pipeline: first, hybrid filtering (keywords, TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and a "nudge-term bonus") reduces the corpus to about 81,000 candidates. Second, we use OpenScholar (quantized LLaMA 3.1 8B) to classify papers and extract structured fields like nudge type and target behavior in a single pass, validated against a JSON schema.
  We evaluated four configurations on a labeled test set (N=197). The best setup (Title/Abstract/Intro) achieved a 67.0% F1 score and 72.0% recall, ideal for discovery. A high-precision variant using self-consistency (7 randomized passes) achieved 100% precision with 12% recall, demonstrating a tunable trade-off for high-trust use cases. This system is being integrated into Agile Nudge+, a real-world platform, to ground LLM-generated interventions in peer-reviewed evidence. This work demonstrates interpretable, domain-specific retrieval pipelines for evidence synthesis and personalized healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixu Liao, Yating Zhou, Songyang Zhang, Meng Wang, Shuai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful framework for learning generalizable representations, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited, particularly under imbalanced data distributions that are prevalent in real-world applications. Such an imbalance can degrade representation quality and induce biased model behavior, yet a rigorous characterization of these effects is lacking. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance. Major theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Standard LLM evaluations only test capabilities or dispositions that evaluators designed them for, missing unexpected differences such as behavioral shifts between model revisions or emergent misaligned tendencies. Model diffing addresses this limitation by automatically surfacing systematic behavioral differences. Recent approaches include LLM-based methods that generate natural language descriptions and sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based methods that identify interpretable features. However, no systematic comparison of these approaches exists nor are there established evaluation criteria. We address this gap by proposing evaluation metrics for key desiderata (generalization, interestingness, and abstraction level) and use these to compare existing methods. Our results show that an improved LLM-based baseline performs comparably to the SAE-based method while typically surfacing more abstract behavioral differences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have emerged as a key paradigm of Physical AI and are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles, robots, and smart spaces. In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment. We will make the code and related checkpoints publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Bastola, Yang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Childhood malnutrition remains a major public health concern in Nepal and other low-resource settings, while conventional case-finding approaches are labor-intensive and frequently unavailable in remote areas. This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions. The proposed approach supports Nepal's progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and offers a transferable methodological template for similar low-resource settings globally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Li, Yu Hou, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically discovering personalized sequential events from large-scale time-series data is crucial for enabling precision medicine in clinical research, yet it remains a formidable challenge even for contemporary AI models. For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.
  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the "degree of alignment" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.
  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Furthermore, LITT outperforms both the benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets, positioning it as a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angelo Zangari, Peyman Baghershahi, Sourav Medya</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph problems are fundamentally challenging for large language models (LLMs). While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By capturing both local and global-range dependencies, our method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure.</p>

<p>Abstract: Full models of the world require complex knowledge of immense detail. While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate. Conversely, partial models focus on making high quality predictions for a subset of state and actions: those linked through affordances that achieve user intents~\citep{khetarpal2020can}. Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaan Pakala, Aldair E. Gongora, Brian Giera, Evangelos E. Papalexakis</p>
<p>Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to tailor the material design (with respect to its design parameters) to have some desired properties (e.g. Young's modulus). As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayun Pang, Ahmed M. Zaitoun, Xacobe Couso Cambeiro, Ivan Vuli\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) trained on broad organic chemistry to smaller, domain-specific reaction datasets is a key challenge in chemical and pharmaceutical R&D. Effective specialisation requires learning new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks. Here, we evaluate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited, complex datasets. Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA. As LLMs continue to scale, our results highlight the practicality of modular, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for their flexible deployment for chemistry applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrei Kanavalau, Carmen Amo Alonso, Sanjay Lall</p>
<p>Abstract: Normalization is widely viewed as essential for stabilizing Transformer training. We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode. These results take a step towards norm-free Transformers while identifying the special role output normalization plays.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Surya Duvvuri, Nirmal Patel, Nilesh Gupta, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p>
<p>Abstract: Softmax-based dot-product attention is a cornerstone of Transformer architectures, enabling remarkable capabilities such as in-context learning. However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Shang, Zhipeng Yao, Ning Jin, Xiangfei Qiu, Hui Zhang, Bin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series foundation models are typically pre-trained on large, multi-source datasets; however, they often ignore exogenous covariates or incorporate them via simple concatenation with the target series, which limits their effectiveness in covariate-rich applications such as electricity price forecasting and renewable energy forecasting. We introduce LightGTS-Cov, a covariate-enhanced extension of LightGTS that preserves its lightweight, period-aware backbone while explicitly incorporating both past and future-known covariates. Built on a $\sim$1M-parameter LightGTS backbone, LightGTS-Cov adds only a $\sim$0.1M-parameter MLP plug-in that integrates time-aligned covariates into the target forecasts by residually refining the outputs of the decoding process. Across covariate-aware benchmarks on electricity price and energy generation datasets, LightGTS-Cov consistently outperforms LightGTS and achieves superior performance over other covariate-aware baselines under both settings, regardless of whether future-known covariates are provided. We further demonstrate its practical value in two real-world energy case applications: long-term photovoltaic power forecasting with future weather forecasts and day-ahead electricity price forecasting with weather and dispatch-plan covariates. Across both applications, LightGTS-Cov achieves strong forecasting accuracy and stable operational performance after deployment, validating its effectiveness in real-world industrial settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems have been successfully deployed to win medals at international math competitions, assist with research workflows, and prove novel technical lemmas. However, despite their progress at advanced levels of mathematics, they remain stubbornly bad at basic arithmetic, consistently failing on the simple task of adding two numbers. We present a systematic investigation of this phenomenon. We demonstrate empirically that all frontier models suffer significantly degraded accuracy for integer addition as the number of digits increases. Furthermore, we show that most errors made by these models are highly interpretable and can be attributed to either operand misalignment or a failure to correctly carry; these two error classes explain 87.9%, 62.9%, and 92.4% of Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro errors, respectively. Finally, we show that misalignment errors are frequently related to tokenization, and that carrying errors appear largely as independent random failures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongyao Wang, Taoyong Cui, Jiawen Zou, Shufei Zhang, Bo Yan, Wanli Ouyang, Weimin Tan, Mao Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for assessing the reliability of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, identifying extrapolation regimes and enabling uncertainty-aware workflows such as active learning for training dataset construction. Existing UQ approaches for MLIPs are often limited by high computational cost or suboptimal performance. Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations. Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show that $\text{e}^2$IP provides a stronger accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than the non-equivariant evidential baseline and the widely used ensemble method. It also achieves better data efficiency through the fully equivariant architecture while retaining single-model inference efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiadong Hong, Lei Liu, Xinyu Bian, Wenjie Wang, Zhaoyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with recent empirical successes highlighting the effectiveness of signal-space prediction ($x$-prediction). In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Jiang, Yusen Huo, Xiangxin Zhan, Changping Wang, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as the dominant paradigm in generative recommendation for optimizing sequential user interactions. However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanghyun Noh, Jinheon Choi, Yulwha Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enzo Nicolas Spotorno, Antonio Augusto Medeiros Frohlich</p>
<p>Abstract: Runtime quantification of vehicle operational intensity is essential for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring in commercial and heavy-duty fleets. Traditional metrics like mileage fail to capture mechanical burden, while unsupervised deep learning models detect statistical anomalies, typically transient surface shocks, but often conflate statistical stability with mechanical rest. We identify this as a critical blind spot: high-load steady states, such as hill climbing with heavy payloads, appear statistically normal yet impose significant drivetrain fatigue. To resolve this, we propose a Dual-Stream Architecture that fuses unsupervised learning for surface anomaly detection with macroscopic physics proxies for cumulative load estimation. This approach leverages low-frequency sensor data to generate a multi-dimensional health vector, distinguishing between dynamic hazards and sustained mechanical effort. Validated on a RISC-V embedded platform, the architecture demonstrates low computational overhead, enabling comprehensive, edge-based health monitoring on resource-constrained ECUs without the latency or bandwidth costs of cloud-based monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose language model activations into interpretable features, but existing methods reveal only which features activate, not which change model outputs when amplified. We introduce Control Reinforcement Learning (CRL), which trains a policy to select SAE features for steering at each token, producing interpretable intervention logs: the learned policy identifies features that change model outputs when amplified. Adaptive Feature Masking encourages diverse feature discovery while preserving singlefeature interpretability. The framework yields new analysis capabilities: branch point tracking locates tokens where feature choice determines output correctness; critic trajectory analysis separates policy limitations from value estimation errors; layer-wise comparison reveals syntactic features in early layers and semantic features in later layers. On Gemma-2 2B across MMLU, BBQ, GSM8K, HarmBench, and XSTest, CRL achieves improvements while providing per-token intervention logs. These results establish learned feature steering as a mechanistic interpretability tool that complements static feature analysis with dynamic intervention probes</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern data lakes have emerged as foundational platforms for large-scale machine learning, enabling flexible storage of heterogeneous data and structured analytics through table-oriented abstractions. Despite their growing importance, standardized benchmarks for evaluating machine learning performance in data lake environments remain scarce. To address this gap, we present LakeMLB (Data Lake Machine Learning Benchmark), designed for the most common multi-source, multi-table scenarios in data lakes. LakeMLB focuses on two representative multi-table scenarios, Union and Join, and provides three real-world datasets for each scenario, covering government open data, finance, Wikipedia, and online marketplaces. The benchmark supports three representative integration strategies: pre-training-based, data augmentation-based, and feature augmentation-based approaches. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art tabular learning methods, offering insights into their performance under complex data lake scenarios. We release both datasets and code to facilitate rigorous research on machine learning in data lake ecosystems; the benchmark is available at https://github.com/zhengwang100/LakeMLB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kishen N Gowda, Willem Fletcher, MohammadHossein Bateni, Laxman Dhulipala, D Ellis Hershkowitz, Rajesh Jayaram, Jakub {\L}\k{a}cki</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingbang Hu, Yuzheng Hu, Jiaqi W. Ma, Han Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Influence functions and related data attribution scores take the form of $g^{\top}F^{-1}g^{\prime}$, where $F\succeq 0$ is a curvature operator. In modern overparameterized models, forming or inverting $F\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ is prohibitive, motivating scalable influence computation via random projection with a sketch $P \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$. This practice is commonly justified via the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which ensures approximate preservation of Euclidean geometry for a fixed dataset. However, JL does not address how sketching behaves under inversion. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that explains how sketching interacts with other widely-used techniques, such as ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.
  We develop a unified theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions. When $g,g^{\prime}\in\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\geq \text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\ker(F)$. This yields guarantees for influence queries on general test points.
  Overall, this work develops a novel theory that characterizes when projection provably preserves influence and provides principled guidance for choosing the sketch size in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimization modeling underpins decision-making in logistics, manufacturing, energy, and finance, yet translating natural-language requirements into correct optimization formulations and solver-executable code remains labor-intensive. Although large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this task, evaluation is still dominated by toy-sized or synthetic benchmarks, masking the difficulty of industrial problems with $10^{3}$--$10^{6}$ (or more) variables and constraints. A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation. Experiments show substantial performance degradation on MIPLIB-NL for systems that perform strongly on existing benchmarks, exposing failure modes invisible at toy scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinkyo Han, Bahador Bahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Many scientific and engineering systems exhibit intrinsically multimodal behavior arising from latent regime switching and non-unique physical mechanisms. In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hyeongseok Kim, Jacqueline L. Mitchell, Chao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes. We evaluate our approach on feedforward neural networks across over 1100 test cases from 7 widely-used fairness datasets. Results show that it modifies only a small subset of training labels, highlighting its ability to pinpoint the critical training examples that drive prediction changes. Finally, we demonstrate how our counterfactual datasets reveal connections between training examples and test cases, offering an interpretable way to probe dataset bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yili Shen, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reaction prediction have achieved near-saturated accuracy on standard benchmarks (e.g., USPTO), yet most state-of-the-art models formulate the task as a one-shot mapping from reactants to products, offering limited insight into the underlying reaction process. Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Xingyu Guo, Shuang Li, Zhao Zhang, Yan Zhong, Fuzhen Zhuang, Deqing wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs but is challenged by complex, multi-faceted distributional shifts. Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongzhong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformer models through carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks. Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xixuan Hao, Guicheng Li, Daiqiang Wu, Xusen Guo, Yumeng Zhu, Zhichao Zou, Peng Zhen, Yao Yao, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing services has fundamentally transformed urban mobility patterns, making accurate ride-hailing forecasting crucial for optimizing passenger experience and urban transportation efficiency. However, ride-hailing forecasting faces significant challenges due to geospatial heterogeneity and high susceptibility to external events. This paper proposes MVGR-Net(Multi-View Geospatial Representation Learning), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage approach. In the pretraining stage, we learn comprehensive geospatial representations by integrating Points-of-Interest and temporal mobility patterns to capture regional characteristics from both semantic attribute and temporal mobility pattern views. The forecasting stage leverages these representations through a prompt-empowered framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models while incorporating external events. Extensive experiments on DiDi's real-world datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Xingyu Guo, Shuang Li, Yan Zhong, Zhao Zhang, Fuzhen Zhuang, Hongrui Liu, Libang Zhang, Guo Ye, Huimei He</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) aims to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from well-labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. One promising recent approach addresses graph transfer by discretizing the adaptation process, typically through the construction of intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment procedures. However, such discrete strategies often fail in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{DiffGDA}, a \textbf{Diff}usion-based \textbf{GDA} method that models the domain adaptation process as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, a domain-aware network is introduced to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. We theoretically show that the diffusion process converges to the optimal solution bridging the source and target domains in the latent space. Extensive experiments on 14 graph transfer tasks across 8 real-world datasets demonstrate DiffGDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Sonoda, Shunta Akiyama, Yuya Uezato</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a theoretical analysis of LLM-guided formal theorem proving in interactive proof assistants (e.g., Lean) by modeling tactic proposal as a stochastic policy in a finite-horizon deterministic MDP. To capture modern representation learning, we treat the state and action spaces as general compact metric spaces and assume Lipschitz policies. To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $\Omega(\Lambda^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(\lambda^D)$ with $\lambda\ll\Lambda$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner. This provides a principled justification for subgoal decomposition in recent agentic theorem provers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Williams Jonathan, Tureci Esin</p>
<p>Abstract: Looped Language Models (LoopLMs) perform multi-step latent reasoning prior to token generation and outperform conventional LLMs on reasoning benchmarks at smaller parameter budgets. However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME. Despite being trained exclusively on mathematics, RLTT also transfers effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of trajectory-level credit assignment for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongwon Jin, Hanseul Choi, Sunggu Yang, Sungho Park, Jibum Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (ECoG) offers a promising alternative to conventional electrocorticography (EEG) for the early prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD), providing higher spatial resolution and a broader frequency range. However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guozheng Ma, Lu Li, Haoyu Wang, Zixuan Liu, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual reinforcement learning (RL) enables stable online refinement of expressive pretrained policies by freezing the base and learning only bounded corrections. However, value learning in residual RL poses unique challenges that remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify two key bottlenecks: cold start pathology, where the critic lacks knowledge of the value landscape around the base policy, and structural scale mismatch, where the residual contribution is dwarfed by the base action. Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences. Based on these insights, we propose DAWN (Data-Anchored Warmup and Normalization), a minimal approach targeting efficient value learning in residual RL. By addressing these bottlenecks, DAWN demonstrates substantial efficiency gains across diverse benchmarks, policy architectures, and observation modalities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wuyang Zhang, Zhen Luo, Chuqiao Gu, Jianming Ma, Yebo Cao, Wangming Yuan, Yinzhi Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated EEG monitoring requires clinician-level precision for seizure detection and reporting. Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.
  We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots. Multirate sampling maintains long-range context while preserving event-level precision. Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets achieves 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision. This is the first system guaranteeing clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Ma, Nan Chen, Mateo D\'iaz, Soufiane Hayou, Dmitriy Kunisky, Soledad Villar</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern large-scale neural networks are often trained and released in multiple sizes to accommodate diverse inference budgets. To improve efficiency, recent work has explored model upscaling: initializing larger models from trained smaller ones in order to transfer knowledge and accelerate convergence. However, this method can be sensitive to hyperparameters that need to be tuned at the target upscaled model size, which is prohibitively costly to do directly. It remains unclear whether the most common workaround -- tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via hyperparameter scaling laws -- is still sound when using upscaling. We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting. First, motivated by $\mu$P and any-dimensional architectures, we introduce a general upscaling method applicable to a broad range of architectures and optimizers, backed by theory guaranteeing that models are equivalent to their widened versions and allowing for rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits. Second, we extend the theory of $\mu$Transfer to a hyperparameter transfer technique for models upscaled using our method and empirically demonstrate that this method is effective on realistic datasets and architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junichiro Takahashi, Masataka Sato, Satoshi Kodeta, Norihiko Takeda</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of multimodal medical AI. While models such as MedGemini achieve high accuracy on VQA tasks like USMLE MM, their performance on ECG based tasks remains limited, and some models, such as MedGemma, do not support ECG data at all. Interpreting ECGs is inherently challenging, and diagnostic accuracy can vary depending on the interpreter's experience. Although echocardiography provides rich diagnostic information, it requires specialized equipment and personnel, limiting its availability. In this study, we focus on constructing a robust ECG encoder for multimodal pretraining using real world hospital data. We employ SigLIP, a CLIP based model with a sigmoid based loss function enabling multi label prediction, and introduce a modified loss function tailored to the multi label nature of ECG data. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating medical knowledge in the language model and applying the modified loss significantly improve multi label ECG classification. To further enhance performance, we increase the embedding dimensionality and apply random cropping to mitigate data drift. Finally, per label analysis reveals which ECG findings are easier or harder to predict. Our study provides a foundational framework for developing medical models that utilize ECG data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose and study an online version of min-max optimization based on cumulative saddle points under a variety of performance measures beyond convex-concave settings. After first observing the incompatibility of (static) Nash equilibrium (SNE-Reg$_T$) with individual regrets even for strongly convex-strongly concave functions, we propose an alternate \emph{static} duality gap (SDual-Gap$_T$) inspired by the online convex optimization (OCO) framework. We provide algorithms that, using a reduction to classic OCO problems, achieve bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and a novel \emph{dynamic} saddle point regret (DSP-Reg$_T$), which we suggest naturally represents a min-max version of the dynamic regret in OCO. We derive our bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and DSP-Reg$_T$~under strong convexity-strong concavity and a min-max notion of exponential concavity (min-max EC), and in addition we establish a class of functions satisfying min-max EC~that captures a two-player variant of the classic portfolio selection problem. Finally, for a dynamic notion of regret compatible with individual regrets, we derive bounds under a two-sided Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lev McKinney, Anvith Thudi, Juhan Bae, Tara Rezaei, Nicolas Papernot, Sheila A. McIlraith, Roger Grosse</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard large language model training can create models that produce outputs their trainer deems unacceptable in deployment. The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxiao Wang, Kai Li, Tianyi Liu, Chen Li, Junzhe Wang, Yifan Zhang, Jian Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to distill mathematical equations from observational data. Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Partohaghighi, Roummel Marcia, Bruce J. West, YangQuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.</p>

<p>Abstract: The trade-off between interpretability and accuracy remains a core challenge in machine learning. Standard Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer clear feature attributions but are often constrained by their strictly additive nature, which can limit predictive performance. Introducing feature interactions can boost accuracy yet may obscure individual feature contributions. To address these issues, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), a novel framework that seamlessly balances interpretability and accuracy. NAEs employ a mixture of experts framework, learning multiple specialized networks per feature, while a dynamic gating mechanism integrates information across features, thereby relaxing rigid additive constraints. Furthermore, we propose targeted regularization techniques to mitigate variance among expert predictions, facilitating a smooth transition from an exclusively additive model to one that captures intricate feature interactions while maintaining clarity in feature attributions. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic data illustrate the model's flexibility, and extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that NAEs achieve an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and transparent, feature-level explanations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hosein Anjidani, S. Yahya S. R. Tehrani, Mohammad Mahdi Mojahedian, Mohammad Hossein Yassaee</p>
<p>Abstract: When a source-trained model $Q$ is replaced by a model $\tilde{Q}$ trained on shifted data, its performance on the source domain can change unpredictably. To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $\Delta R := R_P(\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|\Delta R|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|\Delta R|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet faces challenges in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings due to client drift, which impairs convergence. We propose RI-FedAvg, a novel FL algorithm that mitigates client drift by incorporating a Roughness Index (RI)-based regularization term into the local objective, adaptively penalizing updates based on the fluctuations of local loss landscapes. This paper introduces RI-FedAvg, leveraging the RI to quantify the roughness of high-dimensional loss functions, ensuring robust optimization in heterogeneous settings. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for non-convex objectives, establishing that RI-FedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that RI-FedAvg outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, SCAFFOLD, and DP-FedAvg, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence in non-IID scenarios.

In this work, we improve the optimization of mixture density networks by integrating their information geometry. Specifically, we interpret mixture density networks as deep latent-variable models and analyze them through an expectation maximization framework, which reveals surprising theoretical connections to natural gradient descent. We then exploit such connections to derive the natural gradient expectation maximization (nGEM) objective. We show that empirically nGEM achieves up to 10$\times$ faster convergence while adding almost zerocomputational overhead, and scales well to high-dimensional data where NLL otherwise fails.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arnav Shah, Junzhe Li, Parsa Idehpour, Adibvafa Fallahpour, Brandon Wang, Sukjun Hwang, Bo Wang, Patrick D. Hsu, Hani Goodarzi, Albert Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Genomic foundation models have the potential to decode DNA syntax, yet face a fundamental tradeoff in their input representation. Standard fixed-vocabulary tokenizers fragment biologically meaningful motifs such as codons and regulatory elements, while nucleotide-level models preserve biological coherence but incur prohibitive computational costs for long contexts. We introduce dnaHNet, a state-of-the-art tokenizer-free autoregressive model that segments and models genomic sequences end-to-end. Using a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism, dnaHNet compresses raw nucleotides into latent tokens adaptively, balancing compression with predictive accuracy. Pretrained on prokaryotic genomes, dnaHNet outperforms leading architectures including StripedHyena2 in scaling and efficiency. This recursive chunking yields quadratic FLOP reductions, enabling $>3 \times$ inference speedup over Transformers. On zero-shot tasks, dnaHNet achieves superior performance in predicting protein variant fitness and gene essentiality, while automatically discovering hierarchical biological structures without supervision. These results establish dnaHNet as a scalable, interpretable framework for next-generation genomic modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sansheng Cao, Zhengyu Ma, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has long been favored for its biological plausibility and its capacity to handle non-differentiable objectives, yet its computational complexity has historically limited its application in deep neural networks. Challenging the conventional paradigm that gradients propagate layer-by-layer, we propose Hierarchical Zeroth-Order (HZO) optimization, a novel divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the depth dimension of the network. We prove that HZO reduces the query complexity from $O(ML^2)$ to $O(ML \log L)$ for a network of width $M$ and depth $L$, representing a significant leap over existing ZO methodologies. Furthermore, we provide a detailed error analysis showing that HZO maintains numerical stability by operating near the unitary limit ($L_{lip} \approx 1$). Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that HZO achieves competitive accuracy compared to backpropagation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10611">On the Role of Consistency Between Physics and Data in Physics-Informed Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\'as Becerra-Zuniga, Lucas Lacasa, Eusebio Valero, Gonzalo Rubio</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention as a surrogate modeling strategy for partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in regimes where labeled data are scarce and physical constraints can be leveraged to regularize the learning process. In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed. These findings clarify the interplay between data quality and physics enforcement in PINNs providing practical guidance for the construction and interpretation of physics-informed surrogate models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nusaibah Farrukh, Malavika Pradeep, Akshay Sasi, Rahul Venugopal, Elizabeth Sherly</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive load, the mental effort required during working memory, is central to neuroscience, psychology, and human-computer interaction. Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights. This work supports the development of wearable, affordable cognitive monitoring systems for neuropsychiatry, education, and healthcare.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Duan, Guowei Rong, Zhuo Li, Bo Chen, Mingyuan Zhou, Dandan Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models learned from human preferences are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback, yet they are often vulnerable to reward hacking due to noisy annotations and systematic biases such as response length or style. We propose Bayesian Non-Negative Reward Model (BNRM), a principled reward modeling framework that integrates non-negative factor analysis into Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model. BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning. To scale BNRM to modern LLMs, we develop an amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations, allowing efficient end-to-end training. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BNRM substantially mitigates reward over-optimization, improves robustness under distribution shifts, and yields more interpretable reward decompositions than strong baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10631">Generative clinical time series models trained on moderate amounts of patient data are privacy preserving</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rustam Zhumagambetov, Niklas Giesa, Sebastian D. Boie, Stefan Haufe</p>
<p>Abstract: Sharing medical data for machine learning model training purposes is often impossible due to the risk of disclosing identifying information about individual patients. Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weilong Chen, Bojun Zhao, Jan Eckwert, Julija Zavadlav</p>
<p>Abstract: Sampling equilibrium molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution is a longstanding challenge. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katariina Perkonoja, Parisa Movahedi, Antti Airola, Kari Auranen, Joni Virta</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a set of metrics for evaluating temporal preservation in synthetic longitudinal patient data, defined as artificially generated data that mimic real patients' repeated measurements over time. The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10670">Domain Knowledge Guided Bayesian Optimization For Autonomous Alignment Of Complex Scientific Instruments</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aashwin Mishra, Matt Seaberg, Ryan Roussel, Daniel Ratner, Apurva Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing complex non-linear systems. However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guobin Shen, Chenxiao Zhao, Xiang Cheng, Lei Huang, Xing Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training stability remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

<p>Abstract: Estimating the expectation of a real-valued function of a random variable from sample data is a critical aspect of statistical analysis, with far-reaching implications in various applications. Current methodologies typically assume (semi-)parametric distributions such as Gaussian or mixed Gaussian, leading to significant estimation uncertainty if these assumptions do not hold. We propose a flow-based model, integrated with stratified sampling, that leverages a parametrized neural network to offer greater flexibility in modeling unknown data distributions, thereby mitigating this limitation. Our model shows a marked reduction in estimation uncertainty across multiple datasets, including high-dimensional (30 and 128) ones, outperforming crude Monte Carlo estimators and Gaussian mixture models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuran Zhao, Kai Ming Ting, Xinpeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) is to identify anomalous graphs that deviate significantly from the majority of graphs in a dataset. While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang, Zunhai Su, Shuhao Hu, Rui Yang, Wei Wu, Yulei Qian, Yuchen Xie, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: While FP8 attention has shown substantial promise in innovations like FlashAttention-3, its integration into the decoding phase of the DeepSeek Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) architecture presents notable challenges. These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seockbean Song, Chenyu Gan, Youngsik Yoon, Siwei Wang, Wei Chen, Jungseul Ok</p>
<p>Abstract: The Rising Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) framework models environments where expected rewards of arms increase with plays, which models practical scenarios where performance of each option improves with the repeated usage, such as in robotics and hyperparameter tuning. For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant superiority over baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaisakh Shaj, Cameron Barker, Aidan Scannell, Andras Szecsenyi, Elliot J. Crowley, Amos Storkey</p>
<p>Abstract: State-space language models such as Mamba and gated linear attention (GLA) offer efficient alternatives to transformers due to their linear complexity and parallel training, but often lack the expressivity and robust state-tracking needed for complex reasoning. We address these limitations by reframing sequence modelling through a probabilistic lens, using Bayesian filters as a core primitive. While classical filters such as Kalman filters provide principled state estimation and uncertainty tracking, they are typically viewed as inherently sequential. We show that reparameterising the Kalman filter in information form enables its updates to be computed via an associative scan, allowing efficient parallel training. Building on this insight, we introduce the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, a neural sequence-modelling primitive that performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty. KLA offers strictly more expressive nonlinear updates and gating than GLA variants while retaining their computational advantages. On language modelling tasks, KLA matches or outperforms modern SSMs and GLAs across representative discrete token-manipulation and state-tracking benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bas Maat, Peter Bloem</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of predicting numeric labels that are constrained to the integers or to a subrange of the integers. For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores sparsification methods as a form of regularization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address high memory usage and computational costs in large-scale graph applications. Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: In federated learning (FL), $K$ clients jointly train a model without sharing raw data. Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $\tau$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $\tau$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural network based receivers have recently demonstrated superior system-level performance compared to traditional receivers. However, their practicality is limited by high memory and power requirements, as separate weight sets must be stored for each code rate. To address this challenge, we propose LOREN, a Low Rank-Based Code-Rate Adaptation Neural Receiver that achieves adaptability with minimal overhead. LOREN integrates lightweight low rank adaptation adapters (LOREN adapters) into convolutional layers, freezing a shared base network while training only small adapters per code rate. An end-to-end training framework over 3GPP CDL channels ensures robustness across realistic wireless environments. LOREN achieves comparable or superior performance relative to fully retrained base neural receivers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enrico Ahlers, Daniel Passon, Yannic Noller, Lars Grunske</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly present in our everyday lives; as a result, they become targets of adversarial attackers seeking to manipulate the systems we interact with. A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li-Min Chu, Kai-Siang Ma, Ming-Hong Chen, Ping-Chun Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain imitation learning (CDIL) accelerates policy learning by transferring expert knowledge across domains, which is valuable in applications where the collection of expert data is costly. Existing methods are either supervised, relying on proxy tasks and explicit alignment, or unsupervised, aligning distributions without paired data, but often unstable. We introduce the Semi-Supervised CDIL (SS-CDIL) setting and propose the first algorithm for SS-CDIL with theoretical justification. Our method uses only offline data, including a small number of target expert demonstrations and some unlabeled imperfect trajectories. To handle domain discrepancy, we propose a novel cross-domain loss function for learning inter-domain state-action mappings and design an adaptive weight function to balance the source and target knowledge. Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite show consistent gains over the baselines, demonstrating that our approach achieves stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjy Friedmann, Nadav Dym</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have been dominated by diffusion models that treat the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a stochastic $N \times N$ heatmap generation task. In this paper, we propose CycFlow, a framework that replaces iterative edge denoising with deterministic point transport. CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports input 2D coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, where the optimal tour is recovered from this $2N$ dimensional representation via angular sorting. By leveraging data-dependent flow matching, we bypass the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in favor of linear coordinate dynamics. This paradigm shift accelerates solving speed by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines, while maintaining competitive optimality gaps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Jiang, Ke Cheng, Xin Xu, Mengyang Pang, Tianhao Lu, Jiaheng Li, Yue Liu, Yuan Wang, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu, Zhouchen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative sequence modeling faces a fundamental tension between the expressivity of Transformers and the efficiency of linear sequence models. Existing efficient architectures are theoretically bounded by shallow, single-step linear updates, while powerful iterative methods like Test-Time Training (TTT) break hardware parallelism due to state-dependent gradients. We propose PRISM (Parallel Residual Iterative Sequence Model) to resolve this tension. PRISM introduces a solver-inspired inductive bias that captures key structural properties of multi-step refinement in a parallelizable form. We employ a Write-Forget Decoupling strategy that isolates non-linearity within the injection operator. To bypass the serial dependency of explicit solvers, PRISM utilizes a two-stage proxy architecture: a short-convolution anchors the initial residual using local history energy, while a learned predictor estimates the refinement updates directly from the input. This design distills structural patterns associated with iterative correction into a parallelizable feedforward operator. Theoretically, we prove that this formulation achieves Rank-$L$ accumulation, structurally expanding the update manifold beyond the single-step Rank-$1$ bottleneck. Empirically, it achieves comparable performance to explicit optimization methods while achieving 174x higher throughput.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linxuan Xia, Xiaolong Yang, Yongyuan Chen, Enyue Zhao, Deng Cai, Yasheng Wang, Boxi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data remains a fundamental challenge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Cairney-Leeming, Amartya Sanyal, Christoph H. Lampert</p>
<p>Abstract: Models trained by minimizing the average loss often fail to be accurate on small or hard-to-learn groups of the data. Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively studied for tasks like math competitions, complex coding, and scientific reasoning, yet their ability to accurately represent and simulate physical scenarios via code remains underexplored. We propose SimuScene, the first systematic study that trains and evaluates LLMs on simulating physical scenarios across five physics domains and 52 physical concepts. We build an automatic pipeline to collect data, with human verification to ensure quality. The final dataset contains 7,659 physical scenarios with 334 human-verified examples as the test set. We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards that uses a vision-language model as a judge to train textual models. Experiments show that training with our data improves physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10847">Enhancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Global Temporal Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanpu Cao, Lu Dai, Jindong Han, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in numerous real-world applications, yet existing models remain constrained by their reliance on a limited historical context. This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luigi Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have introduced zero-shot prediction capabilities that bypass the need for task-specific training. Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage). We provide practical model selection guidelines and release the complete benchmark framework for reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Orucu, Marcus Medhage, Farnaz Moradi, Andreas Johnsson, Sarunas Girdzijauskas</p>
<p>Abstract: The telecommunications industry is experiencing rapid growth in adopting deep learning for critical tasks such as traffic prediction, signal strength prediction, and quality of service optimisation. However, designing neural network architectures for these applications remains challenging and time-consuming, particularly when targeting compact models suitable for resource-constrained network environments. Therefore, there is a need for automating the model design process to create high-performing models efficiently. This paper introduces TabGNS (Tabular Gated Neuron Selection), a novel gradient-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method specifically tailored for tabular data in telecommunications networks. We evaluate TabGNS across multiple telecommunications and generic tabular datasets, demonstrating improvements in prediction performance while reducing the architecture size by 51-82% and reducing the search time by up to 36x compared to state-of-the-art tabular NAS methods. Integrating TabGNS into the model lifecycle management enables automated design of neural networks throughout the lifecycle, accelerating deployment of ML solutions in telecommunications networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cong Pang, Xuyu Feng, Yujie Yi, Zixuan Chen, Jiawei Hong, Tiankuo Yao, Nang Yuan, Jiapeng Luo, Lewei Lu, Xin Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the strong performance achieved by reinforcement learning-trained information-seeking agents, learning in open-ended web environments remains severely constrained by low signal-to-noise feedback. Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments. The code and datasets will be released in https://github.com/pc-inno/ICA_MM_deepsearch.git.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the sample complexity of learning a uniform approximation of an $n$-dimensional cumulative distribution function (CDF) within an error $\epsilon > 0$, when observations are restricted to a minimal one-bit feedback. This serves as a counterpart to the multivariate DKW inequality under ''full feedback'', extending it to the setting of ''bandit feedback''. Our main result shows a near-dimensional-invariance in the sample complexity: we get a uniform $\epsilon$-approximation with a sample complexity $\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}{\log\left(\frac 1 \epsilon \right)^{\mathcal{O}(n)}}$ over a arbitrary fine grid, where the dimensionality $n$ only affects logarithmic terms. As direct corollaries, we provide tight sample complexity bounds and novel regret guarantees for learning fixed-price mechanisms in small markets, such as bilateral trade settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefeng Xu, Graham Cormode</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. However, before training, data must be preprocessed to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and heterogeneous feature scales. This preprocessing stage is critical for model performance but is largely overlooked in FL research. In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments.</p>

In this study, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm designed for board games to achieve more efficient learning.

The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more efficient learning than existing methods across these environments. In addition, our extensive ablation study shows the importance of core techniques used in the proposed method. We believe that our efficient algorithm shows the potential of model-free reinforcement learning in domains traditionally dominated by search-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Natural Hypergradient Descent (NHGD), a new method for solving bilevel optimization problems. To address the computational bottleneck in hypergradient estimation--namely, the need to compute or approximate Hessian inverse--we exploit the statistical structure of the inner optimization problem and use the empirical Fisher information matrix as an asymptotically consistent surrogate for the Hessian. This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks further demonstrate the practical advantages of NHGD, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in large-scale machine learning settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian D. Schiller, Malte Heinrich, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) can be challenging, especially in the presence of long input sequences. A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study safe online reinforcement learning in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under strong regret and violation metrics, which forbid error cancellation over time. Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of missing morphological indicators of a city is crucial for urban planning and data-driven analysis. This study presents the spatial-morphological (SM) imputer tool, which combines data-driven morphological clustering with neighborhood-based methods to reconstruct missing values of the floor space index (FSI) and ground space index (GSI) at the city block level, inspired by the SpaceMatrix framework. This approach combines city-scale morphological patterns as global priors with local spatial information for context-dependent interpolation. The evaluation shows that while SM alone captures meaningful morphological structure, its combination with inverse distance weighting (IDW) or spatial k-nearest neighbor (sKNN) methods provides superior performance compared to existing SOTA models. Composite methods demonstrate the complementary advantages of combining morphological and spatial approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continuous-time generative models have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and synthesis. However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts. This perspective assumes the target distribution is known explicitly, which is almost never the case. In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.</p>

To analyze whether such a bias is present in temporal attention mechanisms, we derive sensitivity bounds on the expected value of the Jacobian of a temporal attention layer. We theoretically show how off-diagonal attention scores depend on the sequence length, and that temporal attention matrices suffer a diagonal attention sink.

<p>Abstract: Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are widely used in large language models to encode token positions through multiplicative rotations, yet their behavior at long context lengths remains poorly characterized. In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.
  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.
  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.
  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupu Gu, Rongzhe Wei, Andy Zhu, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) enables precise modifications to factual content in large language models (LLMs). Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency. These results establish a robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscore the importance of routing-stable interventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanghwa Kim, Junghyun Lee, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits (GLBs) with adversarial corruptions, which subsumes various stochastic contextual bandit settings, including heteroskedastic linear bandits and logistic/Poisson bandits. We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\tilde{{O}}\left( d \sqrt{\sum_t g(\tau_t) \dot{\mu}_{t,\star}} + d^2 g_{\max} \kappa + d \kappa C \right)$, where $\dot{\mu}_{t,\star}$ is the slope of $\mu$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(\tau_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(\tau_t) = \sigma_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(\tau_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\max} = \max_{t \in [T]} g(\tau_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d \sqrt{\sum_t g(\tau_t) \dot{\mu}_{t,\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $\kappa$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Sun, Qiqi Wan, Suyang Zhou, Zhenhao Huang, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Serra Korkmaz, Adam Izdebski, Jonathan Pirnay, Rasmus M{\o}ller-Larsen, Michal Kmicikiewicz, Pankhil Gawade, Dominik G. Grimm, Ewa Szczurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative molecular optimization aims to design molecules with properties surpassing those of existing compounds. However, such candidates are rare and expensive to evaluate, yielding sample efficiency essential. Additionally, surrogate models introduced to predict molecule evaluations, suffer from distribution shift as optimization drives candidates increasingly out-of-distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Self-Improvement, which benefits from (i) a joint generative-predictive model and (ii) a self-improving sampling scheme. The former aligns the generator with the surrogate, alleviating distribution shift, while the latter biases the generative part of the joint model using the predictive one to efficiently generate optimized molecules at inference-time. Experiments across offline and online molecular optimization benchmarks demonstrate that Joint Self-Improvement outperforms state-of-the-art methods under limited evaluation budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Vijaya Kumar, Bhaskar Kataria, Byungsoo Oh, Emaad Manzoor, Rachee Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: In RL post-training of LLM agents, calls to external tools take several seconds or even minutes, leaving allocated GPUs idle and inflating post-training time and cost. While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ammar Ali, Baher Mohammad, Denis Makhov, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Magauiya Zhussip, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Returaj Burnwal, Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt, Balaraman Ravindran</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL), where the goal is to learn safe and reward-maximizing policies from demonstrations that do not have per-timestep safety cost or reward information. In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We study same-source multi-view learning and adversarial robustness for next-day direction prediction with financial image representations. On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Efe Kahraman, Giulio Tosato</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate document page ordering on 5,461 shuffled WOO documents (Dutch freedom of information releases) using page embeddings. These documents are heterogeneous collections such as emails, legal texts, and spreadsheets compiled into single PDFs, where semantic ordering signals are unreliable. We compare five methods, including pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and specialized pairwise ranking models. The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau).</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11057">Divide, Harmonize, Then Conquer It: Shooting Multi-Commodity Flow Problems with Multimodal Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Yuan, Yan Qiao, Zonghui Wang, Wenzhi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The multi-commodity flow (MCF) problem is a fundamental topic in network flow and combinatorial optimization, with broad applications in transportation, communication, and logistics, etc. Nowadays, the rapid expansion of allocation systems has posed challenges for existing optimization engines in balancing optimality and tractability. In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered "agent", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Liu, Zhaorui Zhang, Ray C. C. Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized recommender systems by effectively modeling complex user-item interactions, yet data sparsity and the item cold-start problem significantly impair performance, particularly for new items with limited or no interaction history. While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.</p>

We study this problem in full-body human motion, where large-scale data collection is infeasible but essential for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and where synthetic motion can be generated from motion-capture-derived representations. We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. We also demonstrate that large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals, clarifying key sim-to-real challenges and the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for transferable HAR representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose activation-based data attribution, a method that traces behavioral changes in post-trained language models to responsible training datapoints. By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%. Our method outperforms gradient-based attribution and LLM-judge baselines while being over 10 times cheaper than both. This in-the-wild model organism - emerging from contaminated preference data rather than deliberate injection - provides a realistic benchmark for safety techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Remote change detection in LLMs is a difficult problem. Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.
  Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.
  Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches. B3IT reduces costs by $30\times$ compared to existing methods, while operating in a strict black-box setting.</p>

GRASP first distills group level importance scores from a pretrained tree model via SHAP, then enforces structured sparsity through group $L_{21}$ regularized logistic regression, yielding stable and interpretable selections.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianxun Wang, Grant C. Forbes, Leonardo Villalobos-Arias, David L. Roberts</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline RL algorithms aim to improve upon the behavior policy that produces the collected data while constraining the learned policy to be within the support of the dataset. However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \textit{Q} or \textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Stein Brito</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates are often deployed in data-limited or partially observed regimes where downstream decisions depend on calibrated uncertainty in addition to low prediction error. Existing approaches obtain uncertainty through ensemble replication, fixed stochastic noise such as dropout, or post hoc calibration. Cross-regularized uncertainty learns uncertainty parameters during training using gradients routed through a held-out regularization split. The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying where quantum models may offer practical benefits in near term quantum machine learning (QML) requires moving beyond isolated algorithmic proposals toward systematic and empirical exploration across models, datasets, and hardware constraints. We introduce MerLin, an open source framework designed as a discovery engine for photonic and hybrid quantum machine learning. MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows. The framework already implements hardware aware features, allowing tests on available quantum hardware while enabling exploration beyond its current capabilities, positioning MerLin as a future proof co design tool linking algorithms, benchmarks, and hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David A. Barajas-Solano</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the training and performance of physics-informed learning for initial and boundary value problems (IBVP) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from a statistical learning perspective. Specifically, we restrict ourselves to parameterizations with hard initial and boundary condition constraints and reformulate the problem of estimating PINN parameters as a statistical learning problem. From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $\delta(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions. Furthermore, this analysis show that physics-informed learning with PINNs is a singular learning problem, and we employ singular learning theory tools, namely the so-called Local Learning Coefficient (Lau et al., 2025) to analyze the estimates of PINN parameters obtained via stochastic optimization for a heat equation IBVP. Finally, we discuss implications of this analysis on the quantification of predictive uncertainty of PINNs and the extrapolation capacity of PINNs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11123">From Natural Language to Materials Discovery:The Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Genmao Zhuang, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of high-performance materials remains a central challenge across energy, electronics, and aerospace technologies, where traditional workflows depend heavily on expert intuition and computationally expensive simulations. Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephanie Holly, Alexandru-Ciprian Z\u{a}voianu, Siegfried Silber, Sepp Hochreiter, Werner Zellinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to recover Pareto-optimal designs given a finite, static dataset. Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reinhard Heckel, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi, Christos Thramboulidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has driven recent advances in LLM post-training, in particular for reasoning. Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Plattner, Fabian Paischer, Johannes Brandstetter, Arturs Berzins</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds underpins many applications spanning content creation and robotics. While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahar Kohut, Severyn Shykula, Dmytro Khamula, Mykola Vysotskyi, Taras Rumezhak, Volodymyr Karpiv</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion language models generate text through iterative refinement, a process that is often computationally inefficient because many tokens reach stability long before the final denoising step. We introduce a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that identifies convergence independently at each position. Our method leverages lightweight signals derived from the model's predictions and local context to dynamically determine when individual tokens can be finalized. This yields adaptive per-token freezing without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the total number of diffusion steps required. Across diverse benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, general question answering, and scientific understanding, our approach achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains while preserving generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tessa Han, Sebastian Bordt, Hanlin Zhang, Sham Kakade</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingang Qu, David Holzm\"uller, Ga\"el Varoquaux, Marine Le Morvan</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular foundation models, such as TabPFNv2 and TabICL, have recently dethroned gradient-boosted trees at the top of predictive benchmarks, demonstrating the value of in-context learning for tabular data. We introduce TabICLv2, a new state-of-the-art foundation model for regression and classification built on three pillars: (1) a novel synthetic data generation engine designed for high pretraining diversity; (2) various architectural innovations, including a new scalable softmax in attention improving generalization to larger datasets without prohibitive long-sequence pretraining; and (3) optimized pretraining protocols, notably replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer. On the TabArena and TALENT benchmarks, TabICLv2 without any tuning surpasses the performance of the current state of the art, RealTabPFN-2.5 (hyperparameter-tuned, ensembled, and fine-tuned on real data). With only moderate pretraining compute, TabICLv2 generalizes effectively to million-scale datasets under 50GB GPU memory while being markedly faster than RealTabPFN-2.5. We provide extensive ablation studies to quantify these contributions and commit to open research by first releasing inference code and model weights at https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl, with synthetic data engine and pretraining code to follow.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual generation. Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\textbf{U}$ation $\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released at: $\href{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}$.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this report, we introduce pplx-embed, a family of multilingual embedding models that employ multi-stage contrastive learning on a diffusion-pretrained language model backbone for web-scale retrieval. By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents. These results validate the models' effectiveness in production environments where retrieval quality and efficiency are critical at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jindong Li, Dario Zanca, Vincent Christlein, Tim Hamann, Jens Barth, Peter K\"ampf, Bj\"orn Eskofier</p>
<p>Abstract: Online handwriting recognition using inertial measurement units opens up handwriting on paper as input for digital devices. Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Yi, Jian Zhao, Jiancheng Lv, Tao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart understanding is a quintessential information fusion task, requiring the seamless integration of graphical and textual data to extract meaning. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement. This survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding of how MLLMs are transforming chart information fusion and to catalyze progress toward more robust and reliable systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas K\"ubler, Kailash Budhathoki, Matth\"aus Kleindessner, Xiong Zhou, Junming Yin, Ashish Khetan, George Karypis</p>
<p>Abstract: Minimizing the inference cost and latency of foundation models has become a crucial area of research. Optimization approaches include theoretically lossless methods and others without accuracy guarantees like quantization. In all of these cases it is crucial to ensure that the model quality has not degraded. However, even at temperature zero, model generations are not necessarily robust even to theoretically lossless model optimizations due to numerical errors. We thus require statistical tools to decide whether a finite-sample accuracy deviation is an evidence of a model's degradation or whether it can be attributed to (harmless) noise in the evaluation. We propose a statistically sound hypothesis testing framework based on McNemar's test allowing to efficiently detect model degradations, while guaranteeing a controlled rate of false positives. The crucial insight is that we have to confront the model scores on each sample, rather than aggregated on the task level. Furthermore, we propose three approaches to aggregate accuracy estimates across multiple benchmarks into a single decision. We provide an implementation on top of the largely adopted open source LM Evaluation Harness and provide a case study illustrating that the method correctly flags degraded models, while not flagging model optimizations that are provably lossless. We find that with our tests even empirical accuracy degradations of 0.3% can be confidently attributed to actual degradations rather than noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zahra Khodagholi, Niloofar Yousefi</p>
<p>Abstract: Saliency maps are increasingly used as \emph{design guidance} in siRNA efficacy prediction, yet attribution methods are rarely validated before motivating sequence edits. We introduce a \textbf{pre-synthesis gate}: a protocol for \emph{counterfactual sensitivity faithfulness} that tests whether mutating high-saliency positions changes model output more than composition-matched controls. Cross-dataset transfer reveals two failure modes that would otherwise go undetected: \emph{faithful-but-wrong} (saliency valid, predictions fail) and \emph{inverted saliency} (top-saliency edits less impactful than random). Strikingly, models trained on mRNA-level assays collapse on a luciferase reporter dataset, demonstrating that protocol shifts can silently invalidate deployment. Across four benchmarks, 19/20 fold instances pass; the single failure shows inverted saliency. A biology-informed regularizer (BioPrior) strengthens saliency faithfulness with modest, dataset-dependent predictive trade-offs. Our results establish saliency validation as essential pre-deployment practice for explanation-guided therapeutic design. Code is available at https://github.com/shadi97kh/BioPrior.</p>

<p>Abstract: The AI Control research agenda aims to develop control protocols: safety techniques that prevent untrusted AI systems from taking harmful actions during deployment. Because human oversight is expensive, one approach is trusted monitoring, where weaker, trusted models oversee stronger, untrusted models$\unicode{x2013}$but this often fails when the untrusted model's actions exceed the monitor's comprehension. We introduce legibility protocols, which encourage the untrusted model to take actions that are easier for a monitor to evaluate.
  We perform control evaluations in the APPS coding setting, where an adversarial agent attempts to write backdoored code without detection. We study legibility protocols that allow the untrusted model to thoroughly document its code with comments$\unicode{x2013}$in contrast to prior work, which removed comments to prevent deceptive ones. We find that: (i) commenting protocols improve safety without sacrificing task performance relative to comment-removal baselines; (ii) commenting disproportionately benefits honest code, which typically has a natural explanation that resolves monitor suspicion, whereas backdoored code frequently lacks an easy justification; (iii) gains from commenting increase with monitor strength, as stronger monitors better distinguish genuine justifications from only superficially plausible ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Fu, George Dasoulas, Sameer Gabbita, Xiang Lin, Shanghua Gao, Xiaorui Su, Soumya Ghosh, Marinka Zitnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting how genetic perturbations change cellular state is a core problem for building controllable models of gene regulation. Perturbations targeting the same gene can produce different transcriptional responses depending on their genomic locus, including different transcription start sites and regulatory elements. Gene-level perturbation models collapse these distinct interventions into the same representation.
  We introduce STRAND, a generative model that predicts single-cell transcriptional responses by conditioning on regulatory DNA sequence. STRAND represents a perturbation by encoding the sequence at its genomic locus and uses this representation to parameterize a conditional transport process from control to perturbed cell states. Representing perturbations by sequence, rather than by a fixed set of gene identifiers, supports zero-shot inference at loci not seen during training and expands inference-time genomic coverage from ~1.5% for gene-level single-cell foundation models to ~95% of the genome.
  We evaluate STRAND on CRISPR perturbation datasets in K562, Jurkat, and RPE1 cells. STRAND improves discrimination scores by up to 33% in low-sample regimes, achieves the best average rank on unseen gene perturbation benchmarks, and improves transfer to novel cell lines by up to 0.14 in Pearson correlation. Ablations isolate the gains to sequence conditioning and transport, and case studies show that STRAND resolves functionally alternative transcription start sites missed by gene-level models.</p>

RVMS-Bench utilizes a hierarchical description framework encompassing \textbf{Global Impression, Key Moment, Temporal Context, and Auditory Memory} to mimic realistic multi-dimensional search cues, with all samples strictly verified via a human-in-the-loop protocol. We further propose \textbf{RACLO}, an agentic framework that employs abductive reasoning to simulate the human ``Recall-Search-Verify'' cognitive process, effectively addressing the challenge of searching for videos via fuzzy memories in the real world. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs still demonstrate insufficient capabilities in real-world Video Retrieval and Moment Localization based on fuzzy memories.

<p>Abstract: The effective application of foundation models to translational research in immune-mediated diseases requires multimodal patient-level representations that can capture complex phenotypes emerging from multicellular interactions. Yet most current biological foundation models focus only on single-cell resolution and are evaluated on technical metrics often disconnected from actual drug development tasks and challenges. Here, we introduce EVA, the first cross-species, multimodal foundation model of immunology and inflammation, a therapeutic area where shared pathogenic mechanisms create unique opportunities for transfer learning. EVA harmonizes transcriptomics data across species, platforms, and resolutions, and integrates histology data to produce rich, unified patient representations. We establish clear scaling laws, demonstrating that increasing model size and compute translates to improvements in both pretraining and downstream tasks performance. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite of 39 tasks spanning the drug development pipeline: zero-shot target efficacy and gene function prediction for discovery, cross-species or cross-diseases molecular perturbations for preclinical development, and patient stratification with treatment response prediction or disease activity prediction for clinical trials applications. We benchmark EVA against several state-of-the-art biological foundation models and baselines on these tasks, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on each task category. Using mechanistic interpretability, we further identify biological meaningful features, revealing intertwined representations across species and technologies. We release an open version of EVA for transcriptomics to accelerate research on immune-mediated diseases.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of performative prediction had its beginnings in 2020 with the seminal paper "Performative Prediction" by Perdomo et al., which established a novel machine learning setup where the deployment of a predictive model causes a distribution shift in the environment, which in turn causes a mismatch between the distribution expected by the predictive model and the real distribution. This shift is defined by a so-called distribution map. In the half-decade since, a literature has emerged which has, among other things, introduced new solution concepts to the original setup, extended the setup, offered new theoretical analyses, and examined the intersection of performative prediction and other established fields. In this survey, we first lay out the performative prediction setting and explain the different optimization targets: performative stability and performative optimality. We introduce a new way of classifying different performative prediction settings, based on how much information is available about the distribution map. We survey existing implementations of distribution maps and existing methods to address the problem of performative prediction, while examining different ways to categorize them. Finally, we point out known and previously unknown connections that can be drawn to other fields, in the hopes of stimulating future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhui Deng, Zhongzhi Yu, Guan-Ting Liu, Nathaniel Pinckney, Haoxing Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to hardware design automation, particularly for accurate RTL code generation. Prior efforts follow two largely independent paths: (i) training domain-adapted RTL models to internalize hardware semantics, (ii) developing agentic systems that leverage frontier generic LLMs guided by simulation feedback. However, these two paths exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we present ACE-RTL that unifies both directions through Agentic Context Evolution (ACE). ACE-RTL integrates an RTL-specialized LLM, trained on a large-scale dataset of 1.7 million RTL samples, with a frontier reasoning LLM through three synergistic components: the generator, reflector, and coordinator. These components iteratively refine RTL code toward functional correctness. We further introduce a parallel scaling strategy that significantly reduces the number of iterations required to reach correct solutions. On the Comprehensive Verilog Design Problems (CVDP) benchmark, ACE-RTL achieves up to a 44.87% pass rate improvement over 14 competitive baselines while requiring only four iterations on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Moschella, Laura Manduchi, Ozan Sener</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing size of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes efficient inference challenging, primarily due to the memory demands of the autoregressive Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing eviction or compression methods reduce cost but rely on heuristics, such as recency or past attention scores, which serve only as indirect proxies for a token's future utility and introduce computational overhead. We reframe KV cache eviction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem: learning to rank tokens by their predicted usefulness for future decoding. To this end, we introduce KV Policy (KVP), a framework of lightweight per-head RL agents trained on pre-computed generation traces using only key and value vectors. Each agent learns a specialized eviction policy guided by future utility, which evaluates the quality of the ranking across all cache budgets, requiring no modifications to the underlying LLM or additional inference. Evaluated across two different model families on the long-context benchmark RULER and the multi-turn dialogue benchmark OASST2-4k, KVP significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, zero-shot tests on standard downstream tasks (e.g., LongBench, BOOLQ, ARC) indicate that KVP generalizes well beyond its training distribution and to longer context lengths. These results demonstrate that learning to predict future token utility is a powerful and scalable paradigm for adaptive KV cache management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyedarmin Azizi, Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo, Minoo Ahmadi, Souvik Kundu, Massoud Pedram</p>
<p>Abstract: Many recent reasoning gains in large language models can be explained as distribution sharpening: biasing generation toward high-likelihood trajectories already supported by the pretrained model, rather than modifying its weights. A natural formalization is the sequence-level power distribution $\pi_\alpha(y\mid x)\propto p_\theta(y\mid x)^\alpha$ ($\alpha>1$), which concentrates mass on whole sequences instead of adjusting token-level temperature. Prior work shows that Metropolis--Hastings (MH) sampling from this distribution recovers strong reasoning performance, but at order-of-magnitude inference slowdowns. We introduce Power-SMC, a training-free Sequential Monte Carlo scheme that targets the same objective while remaining close to standard decoding latency. Power-SMC advances a small particle set in parallel, corrects importance weights token-by-token, and resamples when necessary, all within a single GPU-friendly batched decode. We prove that temperature $\tau=1/\alpha$ is the unique prefix-only proposal minimizing incremental weight variance, interpret residual instability via prefix-conditioned R\'enyi entropies, and introduce an exponent-bridging schedule that improves particle stability without altering the target. On MATH500, Power-SMC matches or exceeds MH power sampling while reducing latency from $16$--$28\times$ to $1.4$--$3.3\times$ over baseline decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juyeop Han, Lukas Lao Beyer, Sertac Karaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of sampling-based generative models such as flow matching, they can still produce samples of inconsistent or degraded quality. To assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs, we propose uncertainty-aware flow matching (UA-Flow), a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts the velocity field together with heteroscedastic uncertainty. UA-Flow estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through the flow dynamics. These uncertainty estimates act as a reliability signal for individual samples, and we further use them to steer generation via uncertainty-aware classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance. Experiments on image generation show that UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and that uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Hu, Riya Roshan, Sashank Varma</p>
<p>Abstract: Human reasoning is shaped by resource rationality -- optimizing performance under constraints. Recently, inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models by expanding test-time computation. Specifically, instruction-tuned (IT) models explicitly generate long reasoning steps during inference, whereas Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are trained by reinforcement learning to discover reasoning paths that maximize accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether resource-rationality can emerge from such scaling without explicit reward related to computational costs. We introduce a Variable Attribution Task in which models infer which variables determine outcomes given candidate variables, input-output trials, and predefined logical functions. By varying the number of candidate variables and trials, we systematically manipulate task complexity. Both models exhibit a transition from brute-force to analytic strategies as complexity increases. IT models degrade on XOR and XNOR functions, whereas LRMs remain robust. These findings suggest that models can adjust their reasoning behavior in response to task complexity, even without explicit cost-based reward. It provides compelling evidence that resource rationality is an emergent property of inference-time scaling itself.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David S. Duque-Casta\~no, Lauren Flor-Torres, Jorge I. Zuluaga</p>
<p>Abstract: Context: JWST has enabled transmission spectroscopy at unprecedented precision, but stellar heterogeneities (spots and faculae) remain a dominant contamination source that can bias atmospheric retrievals if uncorrected. Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $\chi^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael-Petru\c{t} Gardo\c{s}</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative image models have enabled the creation of highly realistic political deepfakes, posing risks to information integrity, public trust, and democratic processes. While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable, being an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigates conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than treating uncertainty as a purely Bayesian construct, it is evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration quality, proper scoring rules, and its alignment with prediction errors under both global and confidence-conditioned analyses. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via deterministic metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fully fine-tuned for classification. Deterministic inference is compared with single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates. Evaluation reports ROC-AUC, thresholded confusion matrices, calibration metrics, and generator-disjoint out-of-distribution performance. Results demonstrate that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates enable risk-aware moderation policies. A systematic confidence-band analysis further clarifies when uncertainty provides operational value beyond predicted confidence, delineating both the benefits and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arash Gholami Davoodi, Navid Rezazadeh, Seyed Pouyan Mousavi Davoudi, Pouya Pezeshkpour</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) must balance diversity and creativity against logical coherence in open-ended generation. Existing truncation-based samplers are effective but largely heuristic, relying mainly on probability mass and entropy while ignoring semantic geometry of the token space. We present Top-W, a geometry-aware truncation rule that uses Wasserstein distance-defined over token-embedding geometry-to keep the cropped distribution close to the original, while explicitly balancing retained probability mass against the entropy of the kept set. Our theory yields a simple closed-form structure for the fixed-potential subset update: depending on the mass-entropy trade-off, the optimal crop either collapses to a single token or takes the form of a one-dimensional prefix that can be found efficiently with a linear scan. We implement Top-W using efficient geometry-based potentials (nearest-set or k-NN) and pair it with an alternating decoding routine that keeps the standard truncation-and-sampling interface unchanged. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (GSM8K, GPQA, AlpacaEval, and MT-Bench) across three instruction-tuned models show that Top-W consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art decoding approaches achieving up to 33.7% improvement. Moreover, we find that Top-W not only improves accuracy-focused performance, but also boosts creativity under judge-based open-ended evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-interpretation methods prompt language models to describe their own internal states, but remain unreliable due to hyperparameter sensitivity. We show that training lightweight adapters on interpretability artifacts, while keeping the LM entirely frozen, yields reliable self-interpretation across tasks and model families. A scalar affine adapter with just $d_\text{model}+1$ parameters suffices: trained adapters generate sparse autoencoder feature labels that outperform the training labels themselves (71% vs 63% generation scoring at 70B scale), identify topics with 94% recall@1 versus 1% for untrained baselines, and decode bridge entities in multi-hop reasoning that appear in neither prompt nor response, surfacing implicit reasoning without chain-of-thought. The learned bias vector alone accounts for 85% of improvement, and simpler adapters generalize better than more expressive alternatives. Controlling for model knowledge via prompted descriptions, we find self-interpretation gains outpace capability gains from 7B to 72B parameters. Our results demonstrate that self-interpretation improves with scale, without modifying the model being interpreted.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mashrekur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Satellite foundation models produce dense embeddings whose physical interpretability remains poorly understood, limiting their integration into environmental decision systems. Using 12.1 million samples across the Continental United States (2017--2023), we first present a comprehensive interpretability analysis of Google AlphaEarth's 64-dimensional embeddings against 26 environmental variables spanning climate, vegetation, hydrology, temperature, and terrain. Combining linear, nonlinear, and attention-based methods, we show that individual embedding dimensions map onto specific land surface properties, while the full embedding space reconstructs most environmental variables with high fidelity (12 of 26 variables exceed $R^2 > 0.90$; temperature and elevation approach $R^2 = 0.97$). The strongest dimension-variable relationships converge across all three analytical methods and remain robust under spatial block cross-validation (mean $\Delta R^2 = 0.017$) and temporally stable across all seven study years (mean inter-year correlation $r = 0.963$). Building on these validated interpretations, we then developed a Land Surface Intelligence system that implements retrieval-augmented generation over a FAISS-indexed embedding database of 12.1 million vectors, translating natural language environmental queries into satellite-grounded assessments. An LLM-as-Judge evaluation across 360 query--response cycles, using four LLMs in rotating generator, system, and judge roles, achieved weighted scores of $\mu = 3.74 \pm 0.77$ (scale 1--5), with grounding ($\mu = 3.93$) and coherence ($\mu = 4.25$) as the strongest criteria. Our results demonstrate that satellite foundation model embeddings are physically structured representations that can be operationalized for environmental and geospatial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frances Dean, Jenna Fields, Radhika Bhalerao, Marie Charpignon, Ahmed Alaa</p>
<p>Abstract: Instrumental variable (IV) methods mitigate bias from unobserved confounding in observational causal inference but rely on the availability of a valid instrument, which can often be difficult or infeasible to identify in practice. In this paper, we propose a representation learning approach that constructs instrumental representations from observed covariates, which enable IV-based estimation even in the absence of an explicit instrument. Our model (ZNet) achieves this through an architecture that mirrors the structural causal model of IVs; it decomposes the ambient feature space into confounding and instrumental components, and is trained by enforcing empirical moment conditions corresponding to the defining properties of valid instruments (i.e., relevance, exclusion restriction, and instrumental unconfoundedness). Importantly, ZNet is compatible with a wide range of downstream two-stage IV estimators of causal effects. Our experiments demonstrate that ZNet can (i) recover ground-truth instruments when they already exist in the ambient feature space and (ii) construct latent instruments in the embedding space when no explicit IVs are available. This suggests that ZNet can be used as a ``plug-and-play'' module for causal inference in general observational settings, regardless of whether the (untestable) assumption of unconfoundedness is satisfied.</p>

On a larger 1M-sample 16-dimensional task evaluated on 131k queries, Flash-SD-KDE completes in $2.3$ s on a single GPU, making score-debiased density estimation practical at previously infeasible scales.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately detecting hypoglycemia without invasive glucose sensors remains a critical challenge in diabetes management, particularly in regions where continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is prohibitively expensive or clinically inaccessible. This extended study introduces a comprehensive, multimodal physiological framework for non-invasive hypoglycemia detection using wearable sensor signals. Unlike prior work limited to single-signal analysis, this chapter evaluates three physiological modalities, galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and their combined fusion, using the OhioT1DM 2018 dataset. We develop an end-to-end pipeline that integrates advanced preprocessing, temporal windowing, handcrafted and sequence-based feature extraction, early and late fusion strategies, and a broad spectrum of machine learning and deep temporal models, including CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and TCNs. Our results demonstrate that physiological signals exhibit distinct autonomic patterns preceding hypoglycemia and that combining GSR with HR consistently enhances detection sensitivity and stability compared to single-signal models. Multimodal deep learning architectures achieve the most reliable performance, particularly in recall, the most clinically urgent metric. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary contributions of each modality, strengthening the case for affordable, sensor-based glycemic monitoring. The findings show that real-time hypoglycemia detection is achievable using only inexpensive, non-invasive wearable sensors, offering a pathway toward accessible glucose monitoring in underserved communities and low-resource healthcare environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Jiang, Xinxun Zhang, Enming Zhang, Yuling Xiong, Jun Zhang, Jingwen Wang, Huan Yu, Yuxiang Wang, Hao Wang, Xiao Yan, Jiawei Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has excelled by framing recommendation as next-token prediction. This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences. Existing GR approaches predominantly generate SIDs via Residual Quantization (RQ), where items are encoded into embeddings and then quantized to discrete SIDs. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoye Pan, Haozhe Lei, Fan Zuo, Zilin Bian, Tao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies distributed online convex optimization with time-varying coupled constraints, motivated by distributed online control in network systems. Most prior work assumes a separability condition: the global objective and coupled constraint functions are sums of local costs and individual constraints. In contrast, we study a group of agents, networked via a communication graph, that collectively select actions to minimize a sequence of nonseparable global cost functions and to stratify nonseparable long-term constraints based on full-information feedback and intra-agent communication. We propose a distributed online primal-dual belief consensus algorithm, where each agent maintains and updates a local belief of the global collective decisions, which are repeatedly exchanged with neighboring agents. Unlike the previous consensus primal-dual algorithms under separability that ask agents to only communicate their local decisions, our belief-sharing protocol eliminates coupling between the primal consensus disagreement and the dual constraint violation, yielding sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bounds, both in $O({T}^{1/2})$, where $T$ denotes the time horizon. Such a result breaks the long-standing $O(T^{3/4})$ barrier for CCV and matches the lower bound of online constrained convex optimization, indicating the online learning efficiency at the cost of communication overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driven by scaling laws, recommender systems increasingly rely on large-scale models to capture complex feature interactions and user behaviors, but this trend also leads to prohibitive training and inference costs. While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD). However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

<p>Abstract: Both the backpropagation algorithm in machine learning and the maximum principle in optimal control theory are posed as a two-point boundary problem, resulting in a "forward-backward" lock. We derive a reformulation of the maximum principle in optimal control theory as a hyperbolic initial value problem by introducing an additional "optimization time" dimension. We introduce counter-propagating wave variables with finite propagation speed and recast the optimization problem in terms of scattering relationships between them. This relaxation of the original problem can be interpreted as a physical system that equilibrates and changes its physical properties in order to minimize reflections. We discretize this continuum theory to derive a family of fully unlocked algorithms suitable for training neural networks. Different parameter dynamics, including gradient descent, can be derived by demanding dissipation and minimization of reflections at parameter ports. These results also imply that any physical substrate that supports the scattering and dissipation of waves can be interpreted as solving an optimization problem.</p>

We first consider the i.i.d. arrival model and show that the pure greedy algorithm -- which myopically chooses the welfare-maximizing integral allocation -- achieves $\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ average regret. Importantly, in contrast to prior work, our algorithm does not require distributional knowledge and achieves the optimal regret rate using only the online samples.
  We then go beyond i.i.d. arrivals and investigate a nonstationary model with time-varying independent distributions. In the absence of additional data about the distributions, it is known that every online algorithm must suffer $\Omega(1)$ average regret. We show that only a single historical sample from each distribution is sufficient to recover the optimal $\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ average regret rate, even in the face of arbitrary non-stationarity. Our algorithms are based on the re-solving paradigm: they assume that the remaining items will be the ones seen historically in those periods and solve the resulting welfare-maximization problem to determine the decision in every period. Finally, we also account for distribution shifts that may distort the fidelity of historical samples and show that the performance of our re-solving algorithms is robust to such shifts.</p>

<p>Abstract: GPU memory errors are a critical threat to deep learning (DL) frameworks, leading to crashes or even security issues. We introduce GPU-Fuzz, a fuzzer locating these issues efficiently by modeling operator parameters as formal constraints. GPU-Fuzz utilizes a constraint solver to generate test cases that systematically probe error-prone boundary conditions in GPU kernels. Applied to PyTorch, TensorFlow, and PaddlePaddle, we uncovered 13 unknown bugs, demonstrating the effectiveness of GPU-Fuzz in finding memory errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Tang, Yifan Wang, Mengxiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the pricing query complexity of revenue maximization for a single buyer whose private valuation is drawn from an unknown distribution. In this setting, the seller must learn the optimal monopoly price by posting prices and observing only binary purchase decisions, rather than the realized valuations. Prior work has established tight query complexity bounds for learning a near-optimal price with additive error $\varepsilon$ when the valuation distribution is supported on $[0,1]$. However, our understanding of how to learn a near-optimal price that achieves at least a $(1-\varepsilon)$ fraction of the optimal revenue remains limited.
  In this paper, we study the pricing query complexity of the single-buyer revenue maximization problem under such multiplicative error guarantees in several settings. Observe that when pricing queries are the only source of information about the buyer's distribution, no algorithm can achieve a non-trivial approximation, since the scale of the distribution cannot be learned from pricing queries alone. Motivated by this fundamental impossibility, we consider two natural and well-motivated models that provide "scale hints": (i) a one-sample hint, in which the algorithm observes a single realized valuation before making pricing queries; and (ii) a value-range hint, in which the valuation support is known to lie within $[1, H]$. For each type of hint, we establish pricing query complexity guarantees that are tight up to polylogarithmic factors for several classes of distributions, including monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions, regular distributions, and general distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theshani Nuradha, Sujeet Bhalerao, Felix Leditzky</p>
<p>Abstract: When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\Theta((\varepsilon \beta)^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\beta$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Dong, Yeke Chen, Zeren Luo, Jiahui Zhang, Bowen Xu, Jinghan Lin, Yimin Han, Ji Ma, Zhiyou Yu, Yudong Zhao, Peng Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Pu, Michael S. Lee, Udari Madhushani Sehwag, David J. Lee, Bryan Zhu, Yash Maurya, Mohit Raghavendra, Yuan Xue, Samuel Marc Denton</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-horizon workflow agents that operate effectively over extended periods are essential for truly autonomous systems. Their reliable execution critically depends on the ability to reason through ambiguous situations in which clarification seeking is necessary to ensure correct task execution. However, progress is limited by the lack of scalable, task-agnostic frameworks for systematically curating and measuring the impact of ambiguity across custom workflows. We address this gap by introducing LHAW (Long-Horizon Augmented Workflows), a modular, dataset-agnostic synthetic pipeline that transforms any well-specified task into controllable underspecified variants by systematically removing information across four dimensions - Goals, Constraints, Inputs, and Context - at configurable severity levels. Unlike approaches that rely on LLM predictions of ambiguity, LHAW validates variants through empirical agent trials, classifying them as outcome-critical, divergent, or benign based on observed terminal state divergence. We release 285 task variants from TheAgentCompany, SWE-Bench Pro and MCP-Atlas according to our taxonomy alongside formal analysis measuring how current agents detect, reason about, and resolve underspecification across ambiguous settings. LHAW provides the first systematic framework for cost-sensitive evaluation of agent clarification behavior in long-horizon settings, enabling development of reliable autonomous systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiucai Ding, Chao Shen, Hau-Tieng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiview datasets are common in scientific and engineering applications, yet existing fusion methods offer limited theoretical guarantees, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous and high-dimensional noise. We propose Generalized Robust Adaptive-Bandwidth Multiview Diffusion Maps (GRAB-MDM), a new kernel-based diffusion geometry framework for integrating multiple noisy data sources. The key innovation of GRAB-MDM is a {view}-dependent bandwidth selection strategy that adapts to the geometry and noise level of each view, enabling a stable and principled construction of multiview diffusion operators. Under a common-manifold model, we establish asymptotic convergence results and show that the adaptive bandwidths lead to provably robust recovery of the shared intrinsic structure, even when noise levels and sensor dimensions differ across views. Numerical experiments demonstrate that GRAB-MDM significantly improves robustness and embedding quality compared with fixed-bandwidth and equal-bandwidth baselines, and usually outperform existing algorithms. The proposed framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for multiview sensor fusion in high-dimensional noisy environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soham Bakshi, Sunrit Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of model collapse has presented new challenges in iterative training of generative models, where such training with synthetic data leads to an overall degradation of performance. This paper looks at the problem from a statistical viewpoint, illustrating that one can actually hope for improvement when models are trained on data contaminated with synthetic samples, as long as there is some amount of fresh information from the true target distribution. In particular, we consider iterative training on samples sourced from a mixture of the true target and synthetic distributions. We analyze the entire iterative evolution in a next-token prediction language model, capturing how the interplay between the mixture weights and the sample size controls the overall long-term performance. With non-trivial mixture weight of the true distribution, even if it decays over time, simply training the model in a contamination-agnostic manner with appropriate sample sizes can avoid collapse and even recover the true target distribution under certain conditions. Simulation studies support our findings and also show that such behavior is more general for other classes of models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Whitehouse, Ayush Sawarni, Vasilis Syrgkanis</p>
<p>Abstract: The SHAP (short for Shapley additive explanation) framework has become an essential tool for attributing importance to variables in predictive tasks. In model-agnostic settings, SHAP uses the concept of Shapley values from cooperative game theory to fairly allocate credit to the features in a vector $X$ based on their contribution to an outcome $Y$. While the explanations offered by SHAP are local by nature, learners often need global measures of feature importance in order to improve model explainability and perform feature selection. The most common approach for converting these local explanations into global ones is to compute either the mean absolute SHAP or mean squared SHAP. However, despite their ubiquity, there do not exist approaches for performing statistical inference on these quantities.
  In this paper, we take a semi-parametric approach for calibrating confidence in estimates of the $p$th powers of Shapley additive explanations. We show that, by treating the SHAP curve as a nuisance function that must be estimated from data, one can reliably construct asymptotically normal estimates of the $p$th powers of SHAP. When $p \geq 2$, we show a de-biased estimator that combines U-statistics with Neyman orthogonal scores for functionals of nested regressions is asymptotically normal. When $1 \leq p < 2$ (and the hence target parameter is not twice differentiable), we construct de-biased U-statistics for a smoothed alternative. In particular, we show how to carefully tune the temperature parameter of the smoothing function in order to obtain inference for the true, unsmoothed $p$th power. We complement these results by presenting a Neyman orthogonal loss that can be used to learn the SHAP curve via empirical risk minimization and discussing excess risk guarantees for commonly used function classes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Sonoda, Shunta Akiyama, Yuya Uezato</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic theorem provers -- pipelines that couple a mathematical reasoning model with library retrieval, subgoal-decomposition/search planner, and a proof assistant verifier -- have recently achieved striking empirical success, yet it remains unclear which components drive performance and why such systems work at all despite classical hardness of proof search. We propose a distributional viewpoint and introduce **statistical provability**, defined as the finite-horizon success probability of reaching a verified proof, averaged over an instance distribution, and formalize modern theorem-proving pipelines as time-bounded MDPs. Exploiting Bellman structure, we prove existence of optimal policies under mild regularity, derive provability certificates via sub-/super-solution inequalities, and bound the performance gap of score-guided planning (greedy/top-\(k\)/beam/rollouts) in terms of approximation error, sequential statistical complexity, representation geometry (metric entropy/doubling structure), and action-gap margin tails. Together, our theory provides a principled, component-sensitive explanation of when and why agentic theorem provers succeed on biased real-world problem distributions, while clarifying limitations in worst-case or adversarial regimes.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10541">Solving PDEs in One Shot via Fourier Features with Exact Analytical Derivatives</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonin Sulc</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent random feature methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) reduce computational cost compared to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) but still rely on iterative optimization or expensive derivative computation. We observe that sinusoidal random Fourier features possess a cyclic derivative structure: the derivative of any order of $\sin(\mathbf{W}\cdot\mathbf{x}+b)$ is a single sinusoid with a monomial prefactor, computable in $O(1)$ operations. Alternative activations such as $\tanh$, used in prior one-shot methods like PIELM, lack this property: their higher-order derivatives grow as $O(2^n)$ terms, requiring automatic differentiation for operator assembly. We propose FastLSQ, which combines frozen random Fourier features with analytical operator assembly to solve linear PDEs via a single least-squares call, and extend it to nonlinear PDEs via Newton--Raphson iteration where each linearized step is a FastLSQ solve. On a benchmark of 17 PDEs spanning 1 to 6 dimensions, FastLSQ achieves relative $L^2$ errors of $10^{-7}$ in 0.07\,s on linear problems, three orders of magnitude more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art iterative PINN solvers, and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ on nonlinear problems via Newton iteration in under 9s.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ozgur Ercetin, Mohaned Chraiti</p>
<p>Abstract: Shannon theory models communication as the reliable transfer of symbol sequences, with performance governed by capacity and rate-distortion limits. When both endpoints possess strong predictors -- as in modern large language models and related generative priors -- literal symbol transport is no longer the only operational regime. We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyuan Chang, Yuling Jiao, Lican Kang, Junjie Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel deep bootstrap framework for nonparametric regression based on conditional diffusion models. Specifically, we construct a conditional diffusion model to learn the distribution of the response variable given the covariates. This model is then used to generate bootstrap samples by pairing the original covariates with newly synthesized responses. We reformulate nonparametric regression as conditional sample mean estimation, which is implemented directly via the learned conditional diffusion model. Unlike traditional bootstrap methods that decouple the estimation of the conditional distribution, sampling, and nonparametric regression, our approach integrates these components into a unified generative framework. With the expressive capacity of diffusion models, our method facilitates both efficient sampling from high-dimensional or multimodal distributions and accurate nonparametric estimation. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the proposed method. In particular, we derive optimal end-to-end convergence rates in the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target conditional distributions. Building on this foundation, we further establish the convergence guarantees of the resulting bootstrap procedure. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach for complex regression tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze Tang, Penny Sweetser</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.</p>

In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other. We evaluate NSAM on multiple domains with constraints, and experimental results demonstrate that NSAM significantly improves sample efficiency of DRL agent while substantially reducing constraint violations.</p>

<p>Abstract: To develop socially intelligent AI, existing approaches typically model human behavioral dimensions (e.g., affective, cognitive, or social attributes) in isolation. Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article we develop a new method for summarizing a ranking distribution, \textit{i.e.} a probability distribution on the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, beyond the classical theory of consensus and Kemeny medians. Based on the notion of \textit{local ranking median}, we introduce the concept of \textit{consensus ranking distribution} ($\crd$), a sparse mixture model of Dirac masses on $\mathfrak{S}_n$, in order to approximate a ranking distribution with small distortion from a mass transportation perspective. We prove that by choosing the popular Kendall $\tau$ distance as the cost function, the optimal distortion can be expressed as a function of pairwise probabilities, paving the way for the development of efficient learning methods that do not suffer from the lack of vector space structure on $\mathfrak{S}_n$. In particular, we propose a top-down tree-structured statistical algorithm that allows for the progressive refinement of a CRD based on ranking data, from the Dirac mass at a Kemeny median at the root of the tree to the empirical ranking data distribution itself at the end of the tree's exhaustive growth. In addition to the theoretical arguments developed, the relevance of the algorithm is empirically supported by various numerical experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speech Enhancement (SE) in audio devices is often supported by auxiliary modules for Voice Activity Detection (VAD), SNR estimation, or Acoustic Scene Classification to ensure robust context-aware behavior and seamless user experience. Just like SE, these tasks often employ deep learning; however, deploying additional models on-device is computationally impractical, whereas cloud-based inference would introduce additional latency and compromise privacy. Prior work on SE employed Dynamic Channel Pruning (DynCP) to reduce computation by adaptively disabling specific channels based on the current input. In this work, we investigate whether useful signal properties can be estimated from these internal pruning masks, thus removing the need for separate models. We show that simple, interpretable predictors achieve up to 93% accuracy on VAD, 84% on noise classification, and an R2 of 0.86 on F0 estimation. With binary masks, predictions reduce to weighted sums, inducing negligible overhead. Our contribution is twofold: on one hand, we examine the emergent behavior of DynCP models through the lens of downstream prediction tasks, to reveal what they are learning; on the other, we repurpose and re-propose DynCP as a holistic solution for efficient SE and simultaneous estimation of signal properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many real-world datasets contain hidden structure that cannot be detected by simple linear correlations between input features. For example, latent factors may influence the data in a coordinated way, even though their effect is invisible to covariance-based methods such as PCA. In practice, nonlinear neural networks often succeed in extracting such hidden structure in unsupervised and self-supervised learning. However, constructing a minimal high-dimensional model where this advantage can be rigorously analyzed has remained an open theoretical challenge. We introduce a tractable high-dimensional spiked model with two latent factors: one visible to covariance, and one statistically dependent yet uncorrelated, appearing only in higher-order moments. PCA and linear autoencoders fail to recover the latter, while a minimal nonlinear autoencoder provably extracts both. We analyze both the population risk, and empirical risk minimization. Our model also provides a tractable example where self-supervised test loss is poorly aligned with representation quality: nonlinear autoencoders recover latent structure that linear methods miss, even though their reconstruction loss is higher.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Mendoza Barrionuevo, Samuel Yanes Luis, Daniel Guti\'errez Reina, Sergio L. Toral Mar\'in</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses the problem of analyzing cooperation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems which operate under partial observability and temporal role dependency, framed within a destructive multi-agent foraging setting. Unlike most previous studies, which focus primarily on algorithmic performance with respect to task completion, this article proposes a systematic set of general-purpose cooperation metrics aimed at characterizing not only efficiency, but also coordination and dependency between teams and agents, fairness, and sensitivity. These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction. Several representative approaches have been evaluated, covering both learning-based algorithms and classical heuristic paradigms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the slice-matching scheme, an efficient iterative method for distribution matching based on sliced optimal transport. We investigate convergence to the target distribution and derive quantitative non-asymptotic rates. To this end, we establish __ojasiewicz-type inequalities for the Sliced-Wasserstein objective. A key challenge is to control along the trajectory the constants in these inequalities. We show that this becomes tractable for Gaussian distributions. Specifically, eigenvalues are controlled when matching along random orthonormal bases at each iteration. We complement our theory with numerical experiments and illustrate the predicted dependence on dimension and step-size, as well as the stabilizing effect of orthonormal-basis sampling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Lu, Yuxuan Han, Han Zhong, Zhengyuan Zhou, Jose Blanchet</p>
<p>Abstract: Assortment optimization is a fundamental challenge in modern retail and recommendation systems, where the goal is to select a subset of products that maximizes expected revenue under complex customer choice behaviors. While recent advances in data-driven methods have leveraged historical data to learn and optimize assortments, these approaches typically rely on strong assumptions -- namely, the stability of customer preferences and the correctness of the underlying choice models. However, such assumptions frequently break in real-world scenarios due to preference shifts and model misspecification, leading to poor generalization and revenue loss. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a robust framework for data-driven assortment optimization that accounts for potential distributional shifts in customer choice behavior. Our approach models potential preference shift from a nominal choice model that generates data and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue. We first establish the computational tractability of robust assortment planning when the nominal model is known, then advance to the data-driven setting, where we design statistically optimal algorithms that minimize the data requirements while maintaining robustness. Our theoretical analysis provides both upper bounds and matching lower bounds on the sample complexity, offering theoretical guarantees for robust generalization. Notably, we uncover and identify the notion of ``robust item-wise coverage'' as the minimal data requirement to enable sample-efficient robust assortment learning. Our work bridges the gap between robustness and statistical efficiency in assortment learning, contributing new insights and tools for reliable assortment optimization under uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Jiang, Yangru Huang, Zeyu Wang, Changping Wang, Yuling Xiong, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kian Majlessi, Amir Masoud Soltani, Mohammad Ebrahim Mahdavi, Aurelien Gourrier, Peyman Adibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing sophistication of modern malware and phishing campaigns has diminished the effectiveness of traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems. This work presents SecureScan, an AI-driven, triple-layer detection framework that integrates logistic regression-based classification, heuristic analysis, and external threat intelligence via the VirusTotal API for comprehensive triage of URLs, file hashes, and binaries. The proposed architecture prioritizes efficiency by filtering known threats through heuristics, classifying uncertain samples using machine learning, and validating borderline cases with third-party intelligence. On benchmark datasets, SecureScan achieves 93.1 percent accuracy with balanced precision (0.87) and recall (0.92), demonstrating strong generalization and reduced overfitting through threshold-based decision calibration. A calibrated threshold and gray-zone logic (0.45-0.55) were introduced to minimize false positives and enhance real-world stability. Experimental results indicate that a lightweight statistical model, when augmented with calibrated verification and external intelligence, can achieve reliability and performance comparable to more complex deep learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Zhang, Rui Guo, Yonina C. Eldar</p>
<p>Abstract: In signal processing, the data collected from sensing devices is often a noisy linear superposition of multiple components, and the estimation of components of interest constitutes a crucial pre-processing step. In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition, which combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors to draw component samples from the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing methods, our framework supports incorporating model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge into the diffusion prior in a unified manner. Moreover, the proposed posterior sampler allows component priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed DiG sampler provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. We also show that DiG can be interpreted as an extension of a class of recently proposed diffusion-based samplers, and that, for suitable classes of sensing operators, DiG better exploits the structure of the measurement model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Sheng, Heyong Wang, Ming Hong, Hongman He, Junqiu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, however, the emergence of content generation distortion (hallucination) limits their practical applications. The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10815">Why Does RL Generalize Better Than SFT? A Data-Centric Perspective on VLM Post-Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aojun Lu, Tao Feng, Hangjie Yuan, Wei Li, Yanan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theo Lepage, Reda Dehak</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models trained in a supervised setting have revolutionized audio and speech processing. However, their performance inherently depends on the quantity of human-annotated data, making them costly to scale and prone to poor generalization under unseen conditions. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled data to learn relevant representations. The application of SSL for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively studied, but research on other downstream tasks, notably Speaker Recognition (SR), remains in its early stages. This work describes major SSL instance-invariance frameworks (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, and DINO), initially developed for computer vision, along with their adaptation to SR. Various SSL methods for SR, proposed in the literature and built upon these frameworks, are also presented. An extensive review of these approaches is then conducted: (1) the effect of the main hyperparameters of SSL frameworks is investigated; (2) the role of SSL components is studied (e.g., data-augmentation, projector, positive sampling); and (3) SSL frameworks are evaluated on SR with in-domain and out-of-domain data, using a consistent experimental setup, and a comprehensive comparison of SSL methods from the literature is provided. Specifically, DINO achieves the best downstream performance and effectively models intra-speaker variability, although it is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and training conditions, while SimCLR and MoCo provide robust alternatives that effectively capture inter-speaker variability and are less prone to collapse. This work aims to highlight recent trends and advancements, identifying current challenges in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) fundamentally hinges on the coherent fusion of pre-trained entity semantics with heterogeneous topological structures to facilitate robust relational reasoning. However, existing paradigms encounter a critical "structural resolution mismatch," failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases. Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Why depth yields a genuine computational advantage over shallow methods remains a central open question in learning theory. We study this question in a controlled high-dimensional Gaussian setting, focusing on compositional target functions. We analyze their learnability using an explicit three-layer fitting model trained via layer-wise spectral estimators. Although the target is globally a high-degree polynomial, its compositional structure allows learning to proceed in stages: an intermediate representation reveals structure that is inaccessible at the input level. This reduces learning to simpler spectral estimation problems, well studied in the context of multi-index models, whereas any shallow estimator must resolve all components simultaneously. Our analysis relies on Gaussian universality, leading to sharp separations in sample complexity between two and three-layer learning strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyin Tan, Jennifer D'Souza</p>
<p>Abstract: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses rely on converting narrative articles into structured, numerically grounded study records. Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

<p>Abstract: Despite chain-of-thought (CoT) playing crucial roles in LLM reasoning, directly rewarding it is difficult: training a reward model demands heavy human labeling efforts, and static RMs struggle with evolving CoT distributions and reward hacking. These challenges motivate us to seek an autonomous CoT rewarding approach that requires no human annotation efforts and can evolve gradually.

We show that self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision signals even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. Moreover, when used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an ultra-fast and flexible search algorithm that enables search over trillion-scale natural language corpora in under 0.3 seconds while handling semantic variations (substitution, insertion, and deletion). Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025). As a practical application, we demonstrate that our method identifies benchmark contamination in training corpora, unidentified by existing approaches. We also provide an online demo of fast, soft search across corpora in seven languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of effective initialization methods requires an understanding of random neural networks. In this work, a rigorous probabilistic analysis of deep unbiased Leaky ReLU networks is provided. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the logarithm of the norm of network activations, establishing that, as the number of layers increases, their growth is governed by a parameter called the Lyapunov exponent. This parameter characterizes a sharp phase transition between vanishing and exploding activations, and we calculate the Lyapunov exponent explicitly for Gaussian or orthogonal weight matrices. Our results reveal that standard methods, such as He initialization or orthogonal initialization, do not guarantee activation stabilty for deep networks of low width. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel initialization method, referred to as Lyapunov initialization, which sets the Lyapunov exponent to zero and thereby ensures that the neural network is as stable as possible, leading empirically to improved learning.</p>

This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy. Data mixing methods such as CutMix and MixUp were applied to enhance the model's robustness. The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the overall model performance of both InceptionV3 and Resnet50. Additionally, SHAP analysis is used to improve interpretability, which helps to find the significant parts of the image for the model prediction. This study purposes to highlight how advanced models enhan</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Chen, Eric Vanden-Eijnden</p>
<p>Abstract: We construct and analyze generative diffusions that transport a point mass to a prescribed target distribution over a finite time horizon using the stochastic interpolant framework. The drift is expressed as a conditional expectation that can be estimated from independent samples without simulating stochastic processes. We show that the diffusion coefficient can be tuned \emph{a~posteriori} without changing the time-marginal distributions. Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a F\"ollmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of F\"ollmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic control. We further establish that, under this optimal diffusion coefficient, the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence becomes independent of the interpolation schedule, rendering different schedules statistically equivalent in this variational sense.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniela Mihai, Lucas Weber, Francesca Franzon</p>
<p>Abstract: Human languages provide efficient systems for expressing numerosities, but whether the sheer pressure to communicate is enough for numerical representations to arise in artificial agents, and whether the emergent codes resemble human numerals at all, remains an open question. We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Tehrani, Yahya Emara, Essam Wissam, Wojciech Paluch, Waleed Atallah, {\L}ukasz Dudziak, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing efficient GPU kernels is essential for scaling modern AI systems, yet it remains a complex task due to intricate hardware architectures and the need for specialized optimization expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Shen, Susanne Pielawa, Vedran Dunjko, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instantaneous quantum polynomial quantum circuit Born machines (IQP-QCBMs) have been proposed as quantum generative models with a classically tractable training objective based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and a potential quantum advantage motivated by sampling-complexity arguments, making them an exciting model worth deeper investigation. While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Wind, Jeta Sopa, Laurin Schmid, Quirin Jackl, Sebastian Kiefer, Fei Wu, Martin Mayr, Harald K\"ostler, Gerhard Wellein, Andreas Maier, Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning and language understanding, yet their performance degrades in domains governed by strict formal rules, precise terminology, and legally binding structure. Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence. A web-based demo of SteuerLLM is available at https://steuerllm.i5.ai.fau.de.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biometric footstep recognition, based on a person's unique pressure patterns under their feet during walking, is an emerging field with growing applications in security and safety. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Dorador</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Renet, a principled generalization of the Relaxed Lasso to the Elastic Net family of estimators. While, on the one hand, $\ell_1$-regularization is a standard tool for variable selection in high-dimensional regimes and, on the other hand, the $\ell_2$ penalty provides stability and solution uniqueness through strict convexity, the standard Elastic Net nevertheless suffers from shrinkage bias that frequently yields suboptimal prediction accuracy. We propose to address this limitation through a framework called \textit{relaxation}. Existing relaxation implementations rely on naive linear interpolations of penalized and unpenalized solutions, which ignore the non-linear geometry that characterizes the entire regularization path and risk violating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Renet addresses these limitations by enforcing sign consistency through an adaptive relaxation procedure that dynamically dispatches between convex blending and efficient sub-path refitting. Furthermore, we identify and formalize a unique synergy between relaxation and the ``One-Standard-Error'' rule: relaxation serves as a robust debiasing mechanism, allowing practitioners to leverage the parsimony of the 1-SE rule without the traditional loss in predictive fidelity. Our theoretical framework incorporates automated stability safeguards for ultra-high dimensional regimes and is supported by a comprehensive benchmarking suite across 20 synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that Renet consistently outperforms the standard Elastic Net and provides a more robust alternative to the Adaptive Elastic Net in high-dimensional, low signal-to-noise ratio and high-multicollinearity regimes. By leveraging an adaptive solver backend, Renet delivers these statistical gains while offering a computational profile that remains competitive with state-of-the-art coordinate descent implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Wang, Shengxiang Xu, Hanmo Liu, Jiachuan Wang, Yuyu Luo, Shimin Di, Min-Ling Zhang, Lei Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically generating agentic workflows -- executable operator graphs or codes that orchestrate reasoning, verification, and repair -- has become a practical way to solve complex tasks beyond what single-pass LLM generation can reliably handle. Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Projections (or dimensionality reduction) methods $P$ aim to map high-dimensional data to typically 2D scatterplots for visual exploration. Inverse projection methods $P^{-1}$ aim to map this 2D space to the data space to support tasks such as data augmentation, classifier analysis, and data imputation. Current $P^{-1}$ methods suffer from a fundamental limitation -- they can only generate a fixed surface-like structure in data space, which poorly covers the richness of this space. We address this by a new method that can `sweep' the data space under user control. Our method works generically for any $P$ technique and dataset, is controlled by two intuitive user-set parameters, and is simple to implement. We demonstrate it by an extensive application involving image manipulation for style transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaswat Garg, Matin Moezzi, Brandon Da Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (H-GCRL) provides a powerful framework for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into structured subgoals. However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes. In this work, Normalizing flow-based hierarchical implicit Q-learning (NF-HIQL), a novel framework that replaces unimodal gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both the high- and low-levels of the hierarchy is introduced. This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench. NF-HIQL consistently outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines, demonstrating superior robustness under limited data and highlighting the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Mitcheltree, Vincent Lostanlen, Emmanouil Benetos, Mathieu Lagrange</p>
<p>Abstract: The Euclidean distance between wavelet scattering transform coefficients (known as paths) provides informative gradients for perceptual quality assessment of deep inverse problems in computer vision, speech, and audio processing. However, these transforms are computationally expensive when employed as differentiable loss functions for stochastic gradient descent due to their numerous paths, which significantly limits their use in neural network training. Against this problem, we propose "Scattering transform with Random Paths for machine Learning" (SCRAPL): a stochastic optimization scheme for efficient evaluation of multivariable scattering transforms. We implement SCRAPL for the joint time-frequency scattering transform (JTFS) which demodulates spectrotemporal patterns at multiple scales and rates, allowing a fine characterization of intermittent auditory textures. We apply SCRAPL to differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), specifically, unsupervised sound matching of a granular synthesizer and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. We also propose an initialization heuristic based on importance sampling, which adapts SCRAPL to the perceptual content of the dataset, improving neural network convergence and evaluation performance. We make our code and audio samples available and provide SCRAPL as a Python package.</p>

We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation. Overall, YOR offers competitive functionality for mobile manipulation research at a fraction of the cost of existing platforms. Project website: https://www.yourownrobot.ai/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabia Gondur, Usama Bin Sikandar, Evan Schaffer, Mikio Christian Aoi, Stephen L Keeley</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing the relationship between neural population activity and behavioral data is a central goal of neuroscience. While latent variable models (LVMs) are successful in describing high-dimensional time-series data, they are typically only designed for a single type of data, making it difficult to identify structure shared across different experimental data modalities. Here, we address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts temporally evolving shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously recorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with temporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders (GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a latent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping to observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning latent variability into components that are either shared between or independent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the Fourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach over standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal data consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate smoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to not only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities accurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates on held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world multi-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging alongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements from ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agricultural management, with a particular focus on fertilization strategies, holds a central role in shaping crop yield, economic profitability, and environmental sustainability. While conventional guidelines offer valuable insights, their efficacy diminishes when confronted with extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves and droughts. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Leveraging the Gym-DSSAT simulator, we train an intelligent agent to master optimal nitrogen fertilization management. Through a series of simulation experiments conducted on corn crops in Iowa, we compare Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) models with Markov Decision Process (MDP) models. Our research underscores the advantages of utilizing sequential observations in developing more efficient nitrogen input policies. Additionally, we explore the impact of climate variability, particularly during extreme weather events, on agricultural outcomes and management. Our findings demonstrate the adaptability of fertilization policies to varying climate conditions. Notably, a fixed policy exhibits resilience in the face of minor climate fluctuations, leading to commendable corn yields, cost-effectiveness, and environmental conservation. However, our study illuminates the need for agent retraining to acquire new optimal policies under extreme weather events. This research charts a promising course toward adaptable fertilization strategies that can seamlessly align with dynamic climate scenarios, ultimately contributing to the optimization of crop management practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Zangrando, Piero Deidda, Simone Brugiapaglia, Nicola Guglielmi, Francesco Tudisco</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework connecting the first property of Deep Neural Collapse (DNC1) to the emergence of implicit low-rank bias in nonlinear networks trained with $L^2$ weight decay regularization. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we derive a quantitative relation between the Total Cluster Variation (TCV) of intermediate embeddings and the numerical rank of stationary weight matrices. In particular, we establish that, at any critical point, the distance from a weight matrix to the set of rank-$K$ matrices is bounded by a constant times the TCV of earlier-layer features, scaled inversely with the weight-decay parameter. Second, we prove global optimality of DNC1 in a constrained representation-cost setting for both feedforward and residual architectures, showing that zero TCV across intermediate layers minimizes the representation cost under natural architectural constraints. Third, we establish a benign landscape property: for almost every interpolating initialization there exists a continuous, loss-decreasing path from the initialization to a globally optimal, DNC1-satisfying configuration. Our theoretical claims are validated empirically; numerical experiments confirm the predicted relations among TCV, singular-value structure, and weight decay. These results indicate that neural collapse and low-rank bias are intimately linked phenomena arising from the optimization geometry induced by weight decay.</p>

To mitigate the effects of \emph{distribution shift}, we propose MetricRL, a method that combines metric learning for value function approximation with weighted imitation learning for policy estimation. MetricRL avoids conservative or behavior-cloning constraints, enabling effective learning even in severely sub-optimal regimes. We introduce distance monotonicity as a key property linking metric representations to optimality and design an objective that explicitly promotes it. Empirically, MetricRL consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art goal-conditioned RL methods in recovering near-optimal behavior from sub-optimal offline data.</p>

However, many existing methods for this task fail to properly adjust for time-varying confounding and thus yield biased estimates. There are only a few neural methods with proper adjustments, but these have inherent limitations (e.g., division by propensity scores that are often close to zero), which result in poor performance. As a remedy, we introduce the iterative G-computation network (IGC-Net). Our IGC-Net is a novel, neural end-to-end model which adjusts for time-varying confounding in order to estimate conditional average potential outcomes (CAPOs) over time. Specifically, our IGC-Net is the first neural model to perform fully regression-based iterative G-computation for CAPOs in the time-varying setting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our IGC-Net across various experiments. In sum, this work represents a significant step towards personalized decision-making from electronic health records.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialiang Wang, Hanmo Liu, Shimin Di, Zhili Wang, Jiachuan Wang, Lei Chen, Xiaofang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: High-level automation is increasingly critical in AI, driven by rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experience into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well-suited for meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search cost compared to baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivo Pascal de Jong, Andreea Ioana Sburlea, Matthia Sabatelli, Matias Valdenegro-Toro</p>
<p>Abstract: Aleatoric (data) and epistemic (knowledge) uncertainty are textbook components of Uncertainty Quantification. Jointly estimating these components has been shown to be problematic and non-trivial. As a result, there are multiple ways to disentangle these uncertainties, but current methods to evaluate them are insufficient. We propose that aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimates should be orthogonally disentangled - meaning that each uncertainty is not affected by the other - a necessary condition that is often not met. We prove that orthogonality and consistency and necessary and sufficient criteria for disentanglement, and construct Uncertainty Disentanglement Error as a metric to measure these criteria, with further empirical evaluation showing that finetuned models give different orthogonality results than models trained from scratch and that UDE can be optimized for through dropout rate. We demonstrate a Deep Ensemble trained from scratch on ImageNet-1k with Information Theoretic disentangling achieves consistent and orthogonal estimates of epistemic uncertainty, but estimates of aleatoric uncertainty still fail on orthogonality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Sinong Zhan, Philip Wang, Qingyuan Wu, Yixuan Wang, Ruochen Jiao, Chao Huang, Qi Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we aim to tackle the limitation of the Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) method in stochastic environments where theoretical results cannot hold and performance is degraded. To address this issue, we propose a novel method which infuses the dynamics information into the reward shaping with the theoretical guarantee for the induced optimal policy in the stochastic environments. Incorporating our novel model-enhanced rewards, we present a novel Model-Enhanced AIRL framework, which integrates transition model estimation directly into reward shaping. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the reward error bound and performance difference bound for our method. The experimental results in MuJoCo benchmarks show that our method can achieve superior performance in stochastic environments and competitive performance in deterministic environments, with significant improvement in sample efficiency, compared to existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlin Gu, Hong Xi Tae, Chee Seng Chan, Lixin Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), a setting that has received far less attention than its horizontal counterpart. Specifically, we propose the first method tailored to \textit{label unlearning} in VFL, where labels play a dual role as both essential inputs and sensitive information. To this end, we employ a representation-level manifold mixup mechanism to generate synthetic embeddings for both unlearned and retained samples. This is to provide richer signals for the subsequent gradient-based label forgetting and recovery steps. These augmented embeddings are then subjected to gradient-based label forgetting, effectively removing the associated label information from the model. To recover performance on the retained data, we introduce a recovery-phase optimization step that refines the remaining embeddings. This design achieves effective label unlearning while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our method through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ModelNet, Brain Tumor MRI, COVID-19 Radiography, and Yahoo Answers demonstrate strong efficacy and scalability. Overall, this work establishes a new direction for unlearning in VFL, showing that re-imagining mixup as an efficient mechanism can unlock practical and utility-preserving unlearning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Shen, Hanyan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning has received extensive attention from scholars because it avoids the interaction between the agent and the environment by learning a policy through a static dataset. However, general reinforcement learning methods cannot get satisfactory results in offline reinforcement learning due to the out-of-distribution state actions that the dataset cannot cover during training. To solve this problem, the policy regularization method that tries to directly clone policies used in static datasets has received numerous studies due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, policy constraint methods make the agent choose the corresponding actions in the static dataset. This type of constraint is usually over-conservative, which results in suboptimal policies, especially in low-quality static datasets. In this paper, a hypercube policy regularization framework is proposed, this method alleviates the constraints of policy constraint methods by allowing the agent to explore the actions corresponding to similar states in the static dataset, which increases the effectiveness of algorithms in low-quality datasets. It was also theoretically demonstrated that the hypercube policy regularization framework can effectively improve the performance of original algorithms. In addition, the hypercube policy regularization framework is combined with TD3-BC and Diffusion-QL for experiments on D4RL datasets which are called TD3-BC-C and Diffusion-QL-C. The experimental results of the score demonstrate that TD3-BC-C and Diffusion-QL-C perform better than state-of-the-art algorithms like IQL, CQL, TD3-BC and Diffusion-QL in most D4RL environments in approximate time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\`o Botteghi, Stefania Fresca, Mengwu Guo, Andrea Manzoni</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we devise a new, general-purpose reinforcement learning strategy for the optimal control of parametric dynamical systems. Such problems frequently arise in applied sciences and engineering and entail a significant complexity when control and/or state variables are distributed in high-dimensional space or depend on varying parameters. Traditional numerical methods, relying on either iterative minimization algorithms -- exploiting, e.g., the solution of the adjoint problem -- or dynamic programming -- also involving the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation -- while reliable, often become computationally infeasible. In this paper, we propose HypeRL a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to overcome the limitations shown by traditional methods. HypeRL aims at approximating the optimal control policy directly. Specifically, we employ an actor-critic DRL approach to learn an optimal feedback control strategy that can generalize across the range of variation of the parameters. To effectively learn such optimal control laws for different instances of the parameters, encoding the parameter information into the DRL policy and value function neural networks (NNs) is essential. HypeRL uses two additional NNs, called hypernetworks, to learn the weights and biases of the value function and the policy NNs. In this way, HypeRL effectively embeds the parametric information into the value function and policy. We validate the proposed approach on two parametric control problems, namely (I) a 1D parametric Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with in-domain control, and (ii) a navigation problem of particle dynamics in a parametric 2D gyre flow. We show that the knowledge of physical and task-dependent information and the encoding of this information via a hypernetwork, are essential ingredients for learning parameter-dependent control policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> B\'alint Mucs\'anyi, Natha\"el Da Costa, Philipp Hennig</p>
<p>Abstract: In classification tasks, softmax functions are ubiquitously used as output activations to produce predictive probabilities. Such outputs only capture aleatoric uncertainty. To capture epistemic uncertainty, approximate Gaussian inference methods have been proposed. We develop a common formalism to describe such methods, which we view as outputting Gaussian distributions over the logit space. Predictives are then obtained as the expectations of the Gaussian distributions pushed forward through the softmax. However, such softmax Gaussian integrals cannot be solved analytically, and Monte Carlo (MC) approximations can be costly and noisy. We propose to replace the softmax activation by element-wise normCDF or sigmoid, which allows for the accurate sampling-free approximation of predictives. This also enables the approximation of the Gaussian pushforwards by Dirichlet distributions with moment matching. This approach entirely eliminates the runtime and memory overhead associated with MC sampling. We evaluate it combined with several approximate Gaussian inference methods (Laplace, HET, SNGP) on large- and small-scale datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10), demonstrating improved uncertainty quantification capabilities compared to softmax MC sampling.

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are an important tool for generative modelling, serving as effective priors in applications such as imaging and protein design. A key challenge in applying diffusion models for downstream tasks is efficiently sampling from resulting posterior distributions, which can be addressed using Doob's $h$-transform. This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by learning the optimal control, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the control using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling, inverse problems and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihwan Oh, Minchan Jeong, Jongwoo Ko, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising inference scaling method for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. However, it frequently suffers from belief entrenchment, where agents reinforce shared errors rather than correcting them. Going beyond merely identifying this failure, we decompose it into two distinct root causes: (1) the model's biased $\textit{static initial belief}$ and (2) $\textit{homogenized debate dynamics}$ that amplify the majority view regardless of correctness. To address these sequentially, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$. Our framework first rectifies the static belief via strategic prior knowledge elicitation, then reshapes the debate dynamics by enforcing perspective diversity. Validated on our new $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$ benchmark, $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly mitigates entrenchment, achieving a +9.5\% accuracy gain over ReAct prompting and a +19.0\% higher win rate than standard MAD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagnik Bhattacharya, Abhiram Gorle, Ahsan Bilal, Connor Ding, Amit Kumar Singh Yadav, Tsachy Weissman</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative modeling of non-negative, discrete data, such as symbolic music, remains challenging due to two persistent limitations in existing methods. Firstly, many approaches rely on modeling continuous embeddings, which is suboptimal for inherently discrete data distributions. Secondly, most models optimize variational bounds rather than exact data likelihood, resulting in inaccurate likelihood estimates and degraded sampling quality. While recent diffusion-based models have addressed these issues separately, we tackle them jointly. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), inspired by photon arrival process, which combines exact likelihood estimation with fully discrete-state modeling. Central to our approach is an information-theoretic Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) that has a provable exact relationship with the true data likelihood. ItDPDM achieves improved likelihood and sampling performance over prior discrete and continuous diffusion models on a variety of synthetic discrete datasets. Furthermore, on real-world datasets such as symbolic music and images, ItDPDM attains superior likelihood estimates and competitive generation quality-demonstrating a proof of concept for distribution-robust discrete generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peimian Du, Jiabin Liu, Xiaowei Jin, Wangmeng Zuo, Hui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ichiro Hashimoto</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions of benign overfitting of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers trained on mixture data via gradient descent. Our results are derived by establishing directional convergence of the network parameters and classification error bound of the convergent direction. Our classification error bound also lead to the discovery of a newly identified phase transition. Previously, directional convergence in (leaky) ReLU neural networks was established only for gradient flow. Due to the lack of directional convergence, previous results on benign overfitting were limited to those trained on nearly orthogonal data. All of our results hold on mixture data, which is a broader data setting than the nearly orthogonal data setting in prior work. We demonstrate our findings by showing that benign overfitting occurs with high probability in a much wider range of scenarios than previously known. Our results also allow us to characterize cases when benign overfitting provably fails even if directional convergence occurs. Our work thus provides a more complete picture of benign overfitting in leaky ReLU two-layer neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eitan Levin, Yuxin Ma, Mateo D\'iaz, Soledad Villar</p>
<p>Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed on increasingly complex tasks that require multi-step decision-making. Understanding their algorithmic reasoning abilities is therefore crucial. However, we lack a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating this capability. We propose data structures as a principled lens: as fundamental building blocks of algorithms, they naturally probe structural reasoning-the ability to understand and manipulate relationships such as order, hierarchy, and connectivity that underpin algorithmic reasoning. We introduce DSR-Bench, spanning 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 problem instances. DSR-Bench features hierarchical task organization, fully automated generation and evaluation, and fine-grained diagnostics. Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals critical limitations: the top-performing model achieves only 0.46/1 on challenging instances. Three auxiliary probes targeting more realistic usages expose further weaknesses: models perform poorly on spatial data and context-rich scenarios, and they struggle to reason over their own code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Sinong Zhan, Qingyuan Wu, Philip Wang, Frank Yang, Xiangyu Shi, Chao Huang, Qi Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline-to-online deployment of reinforcement-learning (RL) agents must bridge two gaps: (1) the sim-to-real gap, where real systems add latency and other imperfections not present in simulation, and (2) the interaction gap, where policies trained purely offline face out-of-distribution states during online execution because gathering new interaction data is costly or risky. Agents therefore have to generalize from static, delay-free datasets to dynamic, delay-prone environments. Standard offline RL learns from delay-free logs yet must act under delays that break the Markov assumption and hurt performance. We introduce DT-CORL (Delay-Transformer belief policy Constrained Offline RL), an offline-RL framework built to cope with delayed dynamics at deployment. DT-CORL (i) produces delay-robust actions with a transformer-based belief predictor even though it never sees delayed observations during training, and (ii) is markedly more sample-efficient than na\"ive history-augmentation baselines. Experiments on D4RL benchmarks with several delay settings show that DT-CORL consistently outperforms both history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods, narrowing the sim-to-real latency gap while preserving data efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aojun Lu, Tao Feng, Hangjie Yuan, Chunhui Ding, Yanan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge (stability). Although pre-trained models (PTMs) have provided a strong foundation for CL, existing approaches face a fundamental challenge in balancing these two competing objectives. Current methods typically address stability by freezing the PTM backbone, which severely limits the model's plasticity, particularly when incoming data distribution diverges largely from the pre-training data. Alternatively, sequentially fine-tuning the entire PTM can adapt to new knowledge but often leads to catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the critical stability-plasticity trade-off in PTM-based CL. To address this limitation, we propose Adapting PTMs before the core CL} process (ACL), a novel framework that introduces a plug-and-play adaptation phase prior to learning each new task. During this phase, ACL refines the PTM backbone by aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them from irrelevant classes. This mechanism theoretically and empirically demonstrates desirable balance between stability and plasticity, significantly improving CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Song, Dominik Hofer, Rania Islambouli, Laura Hawkins, Ananya Bhattacharjee, Zahra Hassanzadeh, Jan Smeddinck, Meredith Franklin, Joseph Jay Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Contextual multi-armed bandit (cMAB) algorithms offer a promising framework for adapting behavioral interventions to individuals over time. However, cMABs often require large samples to learn effectively and typically rely on a finite pre-set of fixed message templates. In this paper, we present a hybrid cMABxLLM approach in which the cMAB selects an intervention type, and a large language model (LLM) which personalizes the message content within the selected type. We deployed this approach in a 30-day physical-activity intervention, comparing four behavioral change intervention types: behavioral self-monitoring, gain-framing, loss-framing, and social comparison, delivered as daily motivational messages to support motivation and achieve a daily step count. Message content is personalized using dynamic contextual factors, including daily fluctuations in self-efficacy, social influence, and regulatory focus. Over the trial, participants received daily messages assigned by one of five models: equal randomization (RCT), cMAB only, LLM only, LLM with interaction history, or cMABxLLM. Outcomes include motivation towards physical activity and message usefulness, assessed via ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). We evaluate and compare the five delivery models using pre-specified statistical analyses that account for repeated measures and time trends. We find that the cMABxLLM approach retains the perceived acceptance of LLM-generated messages, while reducing token usage and providing an explicit, reproducible decision rule for intervention selection. This hybrid approach also avoids the skew in intervention delivery by improving support for under-delivered intervention types. More broadly, our approach provides a deployable template for combining Bayesian adaptive experimentation with generative models in a way that supports both personalization and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangpin Peng, Weinong Wang, Zhuotao Tian, Senqiao Yang, Xing Wu, Haotian Xu, Chengquan Zhang, Takashi Isobe, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based methods typically treat all preference pairs equally, overlooking substantial variations in data quality and learning difficulty, which leads to inefficient data utilization and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose Uni-DPO, a unified dynamic preference optimization framework that jointly considers (a) the inherent quality of preference pairs and (b) the model's evolving performance during training. By adaptively reweighting samples based on both factors, Uni-DPO enables more effective use of preference data and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of Uni-DPO. On textual tasks, Gemma-2-9B-IT fine-tuned with Uni-DPO surpasses the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by 6.7 points on Arena-Hard. On mathematical and multimodal tasks, Uni-DPO consistently outperforms baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence of its effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haodong Lu, Chongyang Zhao, Jason Xue, Lina Yao, Kristen Moore, Dong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by task interference and catastrophic forgetting. Existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods mitigate forgetting by adding new task-specific adapters and freezing old ones, but often suffer from redundancy, interference, and ambiguous routing due to coarse-grained experts and routing. Coarse-grained experts (i.e., full LoRA adapters with large rank) encode low-specialty information. Newly added experts often duplicate or conflict with existing ones, causing redundancy and interference. Their low specialization further confuses the router, accelerating routing degradation and forgetting as experts accumulate. In this work, we propose MoRAM (Mixture of Rank-1 Associative Memory). Grounded in the view that weight matrices function as linear associative memories, MoRAM achieves CL as gradual incrementing of atomic rank-1 memory experts. Each rank-1 adapter acts as a fine-grained MoE expert or an associative memory unit. By viewing rank-1 adapters as key-value pairs, we eliminate explicit routers in MoE-LoRA, using a self-activation mechanism where each memory atom evaluates its own relevance via its intrinsic key. This transforms the adaptation process into robust, content-addressable retrieval. Extensive experiments on CLIP and LLMs demonstrate that MoRAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior plasticity-stability trade-offs, improving generalization while mitigating forgetting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungjun Lim, Kangjun Noh, Youngjun Choi, Heeyoung Lee, Kyungwoo Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. Although numerous embedding models have been proposed, no single model consistently dominates across domains and tasks. This variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble coefficients based on embedding uncertainty, derived from a principled surrogate-loss formulation. Additionally, UEC employs an uncertainty-aware similarity function that directly incorporates uncertainty into the similarity scoring, providing a theoretically grounded and efficient surrogate to distributional distances. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Massucco, Davide Murari, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb</p>
<p>Abstract: Training neural networks via backpropagation is often hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. In this work, we design architectures that mitigate these issues by analyzing and controlling the network Jacobian. We first provide a unified characterization for a class of networks with orthogonal Jacobian including known architectures and yielding new trainable designs. We then introduce the relaxed notion of persistent subspace orthogonality. This applies to a broader class of networks whose Jacobians are isometries only on a non-trivial subspace. We propose practical mechanisms to enforce this condition and empirically show that it is necessary to sufficiently preserve the gradient norms during backpropagation, enabling the training of very deep networks. We support our theory with extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yahya Alkhatib, Muhammad Ahmar Jamal, Wee Peng Tay</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal unlearning aims to ensure that a trained conformal predictor miscovers data points with specific shared characteristics, such as those from a particular label class, associated with a specific user, or belonging to a defined cluster, while maintaining valid coverage on the remaining data. Existing machine unlearning methods, which typically approximate a model retrained from scratch after removing the data to be forgotten, face significant challenges when applied to conformal unlearning. These methods often lack rigorous, uncertainty-aware statistical measures to evaluate unlearning effectiveness and exhibit a mismatch between their degraded performance on forgotten data and the frequency with which that data are still correctly covered by conformal predictors-a phenomenon we term ''fake conformal unlearning''. To address these limitations, we propose a new paradigm for conformal machine unlearning that provides finite-sample, uncertainty-aware guarantees on unlearning performance without relying on a retrained model as a reference. We formalize conformal unlearning to require high coverage on retained data and high miscoverage on forgotten data, introduce practical empirical metrics for evaluation, and present an algorithm that optimizes these conformal objectives. Extensive experiments on vision and text benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively removes targeted information while preserving utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linghao Zhu, Yiran Guan, Dingkang Liang, Jianzhong Ju, Zhenbo Luo, Bin Qin, Jian Luan, Yuliang Liu, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1) Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiantian Yang, Zhiqian Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality of multi-omics data, the heterogeneity across modalities, and the lack of reliable biological interaction networks make meaningful integration challenging. In addition, many existing models rely on handcrafted similarity graphs, are vulnerable to class imbalance, and often lack built-in interpretability, limiting their usefulness in biomedical applications. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. Across three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance. The model maintains computational efficiency through the use of sparse graphs and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight the potential of MOTGNN to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Liu, Chun Yang, Zhang xiaoxing, Xiaobin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Wang, Guoming Tang, Junyu Xue, Srinivasan Keshav, Tongxin Li, Chris Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter (BTM) energy sources such as solar panels and battery storage poses new challenges for conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The energy injected from the BTM sources can obscure the power signatures of individual appliances, leading to a significant decrease in NILM performance. To address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and injected energy identification. Using a Transformer-based architecture that integrates sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies, DualNILM effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies in the aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state recognition and energy injection identification. Extensive evaluation on self-collected and synthesized datasets demonstrates that DualNILM maintains an excellent performance for dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional methods. Our work underscores the framework's potential for robust energy disaggregation in modern energy systems with renewable penetration.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16929">Dimensional Collapse in Transformer Attention Outputs: A Challenge for Sparse Dictionary Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junxuan Wang, Xuyang Ge, Wentao Shu, Zhengfu He, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer architectures, and their attention mechanisms in particular, form the foundation of modern large language models. While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are in fact confined to a surprisingly low-dimensional subspace, with an effective dimensionality of only about $60\%$ of the full space. In contrast, MLP outputs and residual streams remain much closer to full-rank, exhibiting effective ranks around $90\%$. This striking dimensional discrepancy is consistently observed across diverse model families and datasets, and is strongly shaped by the attention output projection matrix. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a key factor of the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs), initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language models.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07430">The Choice of Divergence: A Neglected Key to Mitigating Diversity Collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Li, Zhijian Zhou, Jiaran Hao, Jason Klein Liu, Yanting Miao, Wei Pang, Xiaoyu Tan, Wei Chu, Zhe Wang, Shirui Pan, Chao Qu, Yuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective: using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework, Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences (like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingxin Xu, Zhen Dong, Oussama Elachqar, Yuzhang Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Iurada, Simone Bombari, Tatiana Tommasi, Marco Mondelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Wang, Xiaofei Zhang, Xin Zhang, Yukun Liu, Qiong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare, where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a central server not only coordinate model training but also guide a new patient to the hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client. To enable this, we introduce a density ratio model and empirical likelihood-based framework that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient FL systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Long, Changdae Oh, Seongheon Park, Sharon Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding for multimodal reasoning. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representational discrepancy beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 60 model-dataset combinations spanning 10 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Drolet, Firas Al-Hafez, Aditya Bhatt, Jan Peters, Oleg Arenz</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions, enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However, discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations, such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional data from compact latent spaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce decisions that are transparent, interpretable and auditable, a requirement increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable decision paths.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay $\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals, and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Rojas, Jiahe Lin, Kashif Rasul, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Molei Tao, Wei Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions. Building on this insight, we introduce Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines, on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study program-learning methods that are efficient in both samples and computation. Classical learning theory suggests that when the target admits a short program description (for example, a short piece of ``Python code''), it can be learned from relatively few examples by performing ERM over the program class. However, this approach relies on enumerating candidate programs, which is typically exponential in the description length. In contrast, gradient-based training avoids explicit search, but for some families of short programs it can require exponentially many samples to succeed.
  We propose \textsc{LLM-PV}, a propose-and-verify recipe that enables ERM-style selection over a discrete program class without exhaustive enumeration. A pretrained LLM induces a proposal distribution over candidate programs; each proposal is executed, scored on a held-out validation set, and the best program is selected. The method uses no gradient updates and does not use validation feedback to adapt the sampling distribution.
  Across algorithmic tasks including parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing, \textsc{LLM-PV} often recovers the exact underlying rule from a small labeled set and generalizes far beyond the training sequence lengths. In the same regimes, SGD-trained transformers and standard adaptation baselines (fine-tuning and in-context learning), as well as classical ML baselines, can fit the training data yet fail to generalize reliably. Together, these results suggest that pretrained LLM priors can serve as effective search biases for ERM, narrowing the gap between statistical and computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donggeon David Oh, Duy P. Nguyen, Haimin Hu, Jaime F. Fisac</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance. We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP), which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that (i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple, principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most permissive safety filter that is available.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934">Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuofeng Zhang, Ard Louis</p>
<p>Abstract: In this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures -- those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training modifications that barely affect the performance of the underlying deep neural network can substantially change a measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants, can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization measures such as the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable, and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures. However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many post-mortem bounds are fragile, this position paper also argues that developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Hess, Dennis Frauen, Mihaela van der Schaar, Stefan Feuerriegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences, which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO) meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones, we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenrui Cai, Defa Zhu, Qingjie Liu, Qiyang Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model. However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input, thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent, self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency, SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tai Hoang, Alessandro Trenta, Alessio Gravina, Niklas Freymuth, Philipp Becker, Davide Bacciu, Gerhard Neumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning to simulate complex physical systems from data has emerged as a promising way to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical solvers, which often require prohibitive computational costs for high-fidelity solutions. Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective that facilitates PDE matching, where the trajectory produced by integrating the port-Hamiltonian core aligns with the ground-truth trajectory, thereby reducing rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios. Across all tasks, IGNS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNSs, achieving higher accuracy and stability under challenging and complex dynamical systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengdong Ma, Th\'eo Tao Zhaowei, Pengyu Li, Minghao Liu, Haojun Chen, Zihao Mao, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Qi, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem is the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry, dimensional structure variability, and combinatorial explosion beyond Go limit the scalability and generality of existing methods. Here we model the problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to play the games. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors. One player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones to improve exploration quality, cooperatively maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. These matrices are decomposed into representative substructures, providing diverse bases and structural constraints that steer subsequent games and make extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar surpasses records from dimensions 25 to 31 and sets new lower bounds for generalized kissing numbers under various angular constraints. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in other dimensions. Notably, some configurations challenge long-held antipodal paradigms, revealing algebraic correspondences with finite simple groups as well as geometric relationships across dimensions. Inspired by these patterns, humans devised further improved constructions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition via extreme-scale reinforcement learning and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dezhi Ran, Shuxiao Xie, Mingfang Ji, Anmin Liu, Mengzhou Wu, Yuan Cao, Yuzhe Guo, Hao Yu, Linyi Li, Yitao Hu, Wei Yang, Tao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: High-performance GPU kernels are critical for efficient LLM serving, yet their optimization remains a bottleneck requiring deep system expertise. While code LLMs show promise in generating functionally correct code, kernel optimization is intrinsically a search problem over a vast optimization space. The fundamental mismatch prevents existing LLM agents from efficiently exploring the optimization space for diverse hardware and compute patterns. To bridge the gap, we present KernelBand, a framework that formulates kernel optimization as a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, explicitly balancing exploration and exploitation to unlock the potential of code LLMs. To navigate the infinite arm space of optimization strategies applied to candidate kernels, we design two key mechanisms: a hardware-aware pruning strategy via profiling bounds and a trace-driven clustering algorithm that leverages Lipschitz continuity. Theoretically, we prove that KernelBand reduces the regret bound to depend on the compact covering number of runtime clusters, ensuring sample-efficient discovery of high-performance kernels. Extensive experiments on TritonBench-G with three GPU architectures and four code LLMs show that KernelBand consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods with over 33% average improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Bouadi, Pratinav Seth, Aditya Tanna, Vinay Kumar Sankarapu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data drive most real-world machine learning applications, yet building general-purpose models for them remains difficult. Mixed numeric and categorical fields, weak feature structure, and limited labeled data make scaling and generalization challenging. To this end, we introduce Orion-Bix, a tabular foundation model that combines biaxial attention with meta-learned in-context reasoning for few-shot tabular learning. Its encoder alternates standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational attention, fusing their outputs through multi-CLS summarization to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. A label-aware ICL head adapts on the fly and scales to large label spaces via hierarchical decision routing. Meta-trained on synthetically generated, structurally diverse tables with causal priors, Orion-Bix learns transferable inductive biases across heterogeneous data. Delivered as a scikit-learn compatible foundation model, it outperforms gradient-boosting baselines and remains competitive with state-of-the-art tabular foundation models on public benchmarks, showing that biaxial attention with episodic meta-training enables robust, few-shot-ready tabular learning. The model is publicly available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-BiX .</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning neural operators on heterogeneous and irregular geometries remains a fundamental challenge, as existing approaches typically rely on structured discretisations or explicit mappings to a shared reference domain. We propose a unified framework for geometry-independent operator learning that reformulates the learning problem in an intrinsic coordinate space defined on the underlying manifold. By expressing both inputs and outputs in this shared coordinate domain, the framework decouples operator learning from mesh discretisation and geometric variability, while preserving meaningful spatial organisation and enabling faithful reconstruction on the original geometry.
  We demonstrate the framework on cardiac electrophysiology, a particularly challenging setting due to extreme anatomical variability across heart geometries. Leveraging a GPU-accelerated simulation pipeline, we generate large-scale datasets of high-fidelity electrophysiology simulations across diverse patient-specific anatomies and train customised neural operators to predict full-field local activation time maps. The proposed approach outperforms established neural operators on both atrial and ventricular geometries. Beyond cardiac electrophysiology, we further show that the same representation enables operator learning in cardiac biomechanics, a distinct problem involving volumetric deformation, highlighting the generality of the proposed framework. Together, these results establish intrinsic coordinate representations as a principled and extensible pathway for neural operator learning on complex physical systems characterised by heterogeneous geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekai Zhang, Xiao Li, Xiang Li, Lianghe Shi, Meng Wu, Molei Tao, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized spiky representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing balanced representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chama Bensmail</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. This assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different and potentially competing mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing the explanation of a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the training and model selection pipeline itself, without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles. It examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanatory basin or separate into multiple structured explanatory basins. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Adult Income and Breast Cancer datasets using deep neural networks and Logistic Regression. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, explanation stability differs across pipelines. Deep neural networks on Breast Cancer converge to a single explanatory basin, while the same architecture on Adult Income separates into distinct explanatory basins despite identical training conditions. Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer exhibits conditional multiplicity, where basin accessibility is controlled by regularisation configuration. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a correct explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory structure visible and quantifiable, revealing when single instance explanations obscure the existence of multiple admissible predictive mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of the training pipeline under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryon Tjanaka, Henry Chen, Matthew C. Fontaine, Stefanos Nikolaidis</p>
<p>Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms are typically limited to low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the state-of-the-art CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and hence receive the same discount value. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new capabilities for QD algorithms by introducing two new domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other existing black-box QD algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Frontier language model capabilities are improving rapidly. We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architectures that handle this long-context distribution shift.
  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant distribution shifts, including multi-turn conversations, long context prompts, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while our novel architectures address context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.
  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains a key challenge for conditional generative modeling: conditional flow-based methods often fit the training conditions well but fail to extrapolate to unseen ones. We introduce SP-FM, a shortest-path flow-matching framework that improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by conditioning both the base distribution and the flow field on the condition. Specifically, SP-FM learns a condition-dependent base distribution parameterized as a flexible, learnable mixture, together with a condition-dependent vector field trained via shortest-path flow matching. Conditioning the base allows the model to adapt its starting distribution across conditions, enabling smooth interpolation and more reliable extrapolation beyond the observed training range. We provide theoretical insights into the resulting conditional transport and show how mixture-conditioned bases enhance robustness under shift. Empirically, SP-FM is effective across heterogeneous domains, including predicting responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomics and modeling treatment effects in high-content microscopy--based drug screening. Overall, SP-FM provides a simple yet effective plug-in strategy for improving conditional generative modeling and OOD generalization across diverse domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) offer interpretable insights into machine learning predictions by answering ``what if?" questions. However, in real-world settings where models are frequently updated, existing counterfactual explanations can quickly become invalid or unreliable. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistically Safe CEs (PSCE), a method for generating counterfactual explanations that are $\delta$-safe, to ensure high predictive confidence, and $\epsilon$-robust to ensure low predictive variance. Based on Bayesian principles, PSCE provides formal probabilistic guarantees for CEs under model changes which are adhered to in what we refer to as the $\langle \delta, \epsilon \rangle$-set. Uncertainty-aware constraints are integrated into our optimization framework and we validate our method empirically across diverse datasets. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods, where PSCE produces counterfactual explanations that are not only more plausible and discriminative, but also provably robust under model change.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santanu Das, Jatin Batra</p>
<p>Abstract: Phase retrieval is the classical problem of recovering a signal $x^* \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from its noisy phaseless measurements $y_i = \langle a_i, x^* \rangle^2 + \zeta_i$ (where $\zeta_i$ denotes noise, and $a_i$ is the sensing vector) for $i \in [m]$. The problem of phase retrieval has a rich history, with a variety of applications such as optics, crystallography, heteroscedastic regression, astrophysics, etc. A major consideration in algorithms for phase retrieval is robustness against measurement errors. In recent breakthroughs in algorithmic robust statistics, efficient algorithms have been developed for several parameter estimation tasks such as mean estimation, covariance estimation, robust principal component analysis (PCA), etc. in the presence of heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions. In this paper, we study efficient algorithms for robust phase retrieval with heavy-tailed noise when a constant fraction of both the measurements $y_i$ and the sensing vectors $a_i$ may be arbitrarily adversarially corrupted. For this problem, Buna and Rebeschini (AISTATS 2025) very recently gave an exponential time algorithm with sample complexity $O(n \log n)$. Their algorithm needs a robust spectral initialization, specifically, a robust estimate of the top eigenvector of a covariance matrix, which they deemed to be beyond known efficient algorithmic techniques (similar spectral initializations are a key ingredient of a large family of phase retrieval algorithms). In this work, we make a connection between robust spectral initialization and recent algorithmic advances in robust PCA, yielding the first polynomial-time algorithms for robust phase retrieval with both heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions, in fact with near-linear (in $n$) sample complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural gradients have long been studied in deep reinforcement learning due to their fast convergence properties and covariant weight updates. However, computing natural gradients requires inversion of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration, which is computationally prohibitive in nature. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable natural policy optimization technique that leverages a rank-1 approximation to full inverse-FIM. We theoretically show that under certain conditions, a rank-1 approximation to inverse-FIM converges faster than policy gradients and, under some conditions, enjoys the same sample complexity as stochastic policy gradient methods. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of environments and show that it achieves superior performance to standard actor-critic and trust-region baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghwan Lee, Hyukjun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the supervised training dynamics of neural classifiers through the lens of binary hypothesis testing. We model classification as a set of binary tests between class-conditional distributions of representations and empirically show that, along training trajectories, well-generalizing networks increasingly align with Neyman-Pearson optimal decision rules via monotonic improvements in KL divergence that relate to error rate exponents. We finally discuss how this yields an explanation and possible training or regularization strategies for different classes of neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khiem Le, Youssef Mroueh, Phuc Nguyen, Chi-Heng Lin, Shangqian Gao, Ting Hua, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models trained via next-token prediction are fundamentally pattern-matchers: sensitive to superficial phrasing variations even when the underlying problem is identical. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent Pass@k improvements, with gains up to 9.84 points on competition math (AMC12, AIME24) and 5.05 points on out-of-distribution scientific reasoning (GPQA-Diamond).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreshth Saini, Avinab Saha, Balu Adsumilli, Neil Birkbeck, Yilin Wang, Alan C. Bovik</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising non-autoregressive paradigm for generative tasks, offering parallel decoding and bidirectional context utilization. However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation. We will release the code.</p>

<p>Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the gold standard for studying protein dynamics, but their computational cost limits access to biologically relevant timescales. Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuda Song, Lili Chen, Fahim Tajwar, Remi Munos, Deepak Pathak, J. Andrew Bagnell, Aarti Singh, Andrea Zanette</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of RL for LLM post-training stems from an unreasonably uninformative source: a single bit of information per rollout as binary reward or preference label. At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bizhe Bai, Xinyue Wang, Peng Ye, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves LLM reasoning, yet growing evidence indicates an exploration ceiling: it often reweights existing solution traces rather than discovering new strategies, limiting gains under large sampling budgets (e.g., pass-at-256). We address this limitation with PSN-RLVR, which perturbs policy parameters before rollout generation to induce temporally consistent, trajectory-level exploration that better preserves long-horizon chain-of-thought coherence than action-space noise. To mitigate the resulting sampling-update mismatch, we incorporate truncated importance sampling (TIS). To avoid expensive KL-based adaptive noise control, we propose a computationally efficient real-time adaptive noise scheduler driven by a lightweight surrogate that combines semantic diversity with normalized self-certainty. Instantiated on GRPO, a widely used RLVR method, PSN-GRPO consistently expands the effective reasoning capability boundary across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and model families, yielding higher pass-at-k under large sampling budgets and outperforming prior exploration-oriented RLVR methods (e.g., Pass-at-k-style training) while remaining orthogonal and thus composable for additional gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Jing, Qiuhao Zeng, Ruiyi Fang, Yan Sun, Boyu Wang, Pingzhao Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular understanding is central to advancing areas such as scientific discovery, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand molecular graphs effectively. Existing graph-LLM bridges often adapt the Q-Former-style connector with fixed-length static tokens, which is originally designed for vision tasks. These designs overlook stereochemistry and substructural context and typically require costly LLM-backbone fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and generalization. We introduce EDT-Former, an Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer that generates tokens aligned with informative molecular patches, thereby preserving both local and global structural features for molecular graph understanding. Beyond prior approaches, EDT-Former enables alignment between frozen graph encoders and LLMs without tuning the LLM backbone (excluding the embedding layer), resulting in computationally efficient finetuning, and achieves stateof-the-art results on MoleculeQA, Molecule-oriented Mol-Instructions, and property prediction benchmarks (TDC, MoleculeNet), underscoring its effectiveness for scalable and generalizable multimodal molecular understanding</p>

<p>Abstract: While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronald Katende</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern learning systems often interpolate training data while still generalizing well, yet it remains unclear when algorithmic stability explains this behavior. We model training as a function-space trajectory and measure sensitivity to single-sample perturbations along this trajectory. We propose a contractive propagation condition and a stability certificate obtained by unrolling the resulting recursion. A small certificate implies stability-based generalization, while we also prove that there exist interpolating regimes with small risk where such contractive sensitivity cannot hold, showing that stability is not a universal explanation. Experiments confirm that certificate growth predicts generalization differences across optimizers, step sizes, and dataset perturbations. The framework therefore identifies regimes where stability explains generalization and where alternative mechanisms must account for success.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Qiao, Jing Chen, Xiang Ao, Qiwei Zhong, Yang Liu, Qing He</p>
<p>Abstract: Live streaming has become a cornerstone of today's internet, enabling massive real-time social interactions. However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming. Moreover, AC-MIL provides capsule-level interpretability, enabling identification of risky behavior segments as actionable evidence for intervention.

<p>Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiandong Zou, Jianshu Li, Jing Huang, Pan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Shen, Jinji Yang, Junze He, Kunhan Gao, Ziye Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the approximation capabilities of dense neural networks. While universal approximation theorems establish that sufficiently large architectures can approximate arbitrary continuous functions if there are no restrictions on the weight values, we show that dense neural networks do not possess this universality. Our argument is based on a model compression approach, combining the weak regularity lemma with an interpretation of feedforward networks as message passing graph neural networks. We consider ReLU neural networks subject to natural constraints on weights and input and output dimensions, which model a notion of dense connectivity. Within this setting, we demonstrate the existence of Lipschitz continuous functions that cannot be approximated by such networks. This highlights intrinsic limitations of neural networks with dense layers and motivates the use of sparse connectivity as a necessary ingredient for achieving true universality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daisuke Okanohara</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning performed over finite time is inherently irreversible. In Part~I of this series, we modeled learning as a transport process in the space of parameter distributions and derived the Epistemic Speed Limit (ESL), which lower-bounds entropy production under finite-time dynamics.
  In this work (Part~II), we show that irreversibility imposes a geometric restriction on future adaptability through the compositional structure of learning dynamics. Successive learning phases compose multiplicatively as transport maps, and their Jacobians form a semigroup whose rank and singular values are submultiplicative. As a result, dynamically usable degrees of reconfiguration can only decrease under composition.
  We formalize the remaining adaptability of a model in terms of compatible effective rank, defined as the log-volume of task-preserving directions that remain dynamically accessible. Although task performance may remain unchanged, finite-time learning can progressively reduce this reconfiguration capacity.
  We prove a capacity-threshold criterion for continual learning: let m_B denote the stable rank of the Hessian of a new task B restricted to the task-preserving manifold of a previously learned task A. If m_B exceeds the residual compatible effective rank, then task B is trajectory-level incompatible with task A; any sufficient adaptation necessarily induces forgetting.
  Thus catastrophic forgetting arises not from the absence of multi-task solutions, but from irreversible loss of reconfiguration capacity under compositional learning dynamics. This establishes a trajectory-level capacity limit for continual learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Patel, Ambuj Tewari</p>
<p>Abstract: The need to rapidly solve PDEs in engineering design workflows has spurred the rise of neural surrogate models. In particular, neural operator models provide a discretization-invariant surrogate by retaining the infinite-dimensional, functional form of their arguments. Despite improved throughput, such methods lack guarantees on accuracy, unlike classical numerical PDE solvers. Optimizing engineering designs under these potentially miscalibrated surrogates thus runs the risk of producing designs that perform poorly upon deployment. In a similar vein, there is growing interest in automated decision-making under black-box predictors in the finite-dimensional setting, where a similar risk of suboptimality exists under poorly calibrated models. For this reason, methods have emerged that produce adversarially robust decisions under uncertainty estimates of the upstream model. One such framework leverages conformal prediction, a distribution-free post-hoc uncertainty quantification method, to provide these estimates due to its natural pairing with black-box predictors. We herein extend this line of conformally robust decision-making to infinite-dimensional function spaces. We first extend the typical conformal prediction guarantees over finite-dimensional spaces to infinite-dimensional Sobolev spaces. We then demonstrate how such uncertainty can be leveraged to robustly formulate engineering design tasks and characterize the suboptimality of the resulting robust optimal designs. We then empirically demonstrate the generality of our functional conformal coverage method across a diverse collection of PDEs, including the Poisson and heat equations, and showcase the significant improvement of such robust design in a quantum state discrimination task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Saegert, Ullrich K\"othe</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable analytical expressions that accurately describe observed data. Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark. Moreover, it performs on par with state-of-the-art direct optimization (PySR) while recovering more concise instead of more complex expressions with increasing inference budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) in transformers acts as an online associative memory and is believed to underpin their high performance on complex sequence processing tasks. However, in gated linear attention models, this memory has a fixed capacity and is prone to interference, especially for long sequences. We propose Palimpsa, a self-attention model that views ICL as a continual learning problem that must address a stability-plasticity dilemma. Palimpsa uses Bayesian metaplasticity, where the plasticity of each attention state is tied to an importance state grounded by a prior distribution that captures accumulated knowledge. We demonstrate that various gated linear attention models emerge as specific architecture choices and posterior approximations, and that Mamba2 is a special case of Palimpsa where forgetting dominates. This theoretical link enables the transformation of any non-metaplastic model into a metaplastic one, significantly expanding its memory capacity. Our experiments show that Palimpsa consistently outperforms baselines on the Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) benchmark and on Commonsense Reasoning tasks.</p>

This study formalizes Explainable Cross-Domain Transfer Learning (X-CDTL), a framework unifying network science and explainable artificial intelligence to identify structural invariants that generalize across biological, linguistic, molecular, and social networks. By introducing the Importance Inversion Transfer (IIT) mechanism, the framework prioritizes domain-invariant structural anchors over idiosyncratic, highly discriminative features. In anomaly detection tasks, models guided by these principles achieve significant performance gains - exhibiting a 56% relative improvement in decision stability under extreme noise - over traditional baselines. These results provide evidence for a shared organizational signature across heterogeneous domains, establishing a principled paradigm for cross-disciplinary knowledge propagation. By shifting from opaque latent representations to explicit structural laws, this work advances machine learning as a robust engine for scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan von Rad, Yong Cao, Andreas Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Model compression is increasingly essential for deploying large language models (LLMs), yet existing evaluations are limited in method coverage and focus primarily on knowledge-centric benchmarks. Thus, we introduce UniComp, a unified evaluation framework for comparing pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation. UniComp evaluates compressed models along three dimensions: performance, reliability, and efficiency, using a diverse set of capability- and safety-oriented benchmarks together with a hardware-aware efficiency analysis. Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyun Zhou, Jingwei Shi, Mingjing Xu, Zhonghua Jiang, Jingyuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling lightweight student networks to benefit from the performance of redundant teacher networks. However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes. Our findings reveal a promising direction for future research in efficient model compression beyond traditional distillation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a key prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD), and video-polysomnography (vPSG) remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (Cohen's $\kappa$ < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean $\kappa$ = 0.81 in PUB, but $\kappa$ = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with $\kappa$ = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model). In DCSM, mean and median $\kappa$ increased from 0.60 to 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.64 to 0.69 (p < 0.001), respectively. In the interrater study, PSGs with low agreement between the model and the initial scorer showed similarly low agreement between human scorers. Applying a confidence threshold increased the proportion of correctly identified REM sleep epochs from 85% to 95.5%, while preserving sufficient (> 5 min) REM sleep for 95% of subjects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azkaa Nasir, Fatima Dossa, Muhammad Ahmed Atif, Mohammad Shahid Shaikh</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning in deep reinforcement learning is often motivated by improved stability and reduced training cost, but it can also fail under substantial domain shift. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J Rosser, Robert Kirk, Edward Grefenstette, Jakob Foerster, Laura Ruis</p>
<p>Abstract: Influence functions are commonly used to attribute model behavior to training documents. We explore the reverse: crafting training data that induces model behavior. Our framework, Infusion, uses scalable influence-function approximations to compute small perturbations to training documents that induce targeted changes in model behavior through parameter shifts. We evaluate Infusion on data poisoning tasks across vision and language domains. On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned. Taken together, these results show that small, subtle edits to training data can systematically shape model behavior, underscoring the importance of training data interpretability for adversaries and defenders alike.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Clivio, Fabian Falck, Brieuc Lehmann, George Deligiannidis, Chris Holmes</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for matching in causal inference are impractical for high-dimensional datasets. They suffer from the curse of dimensionality: exact matching and coarsened exact matching find exponentially fewer matches as the input dimension grows, and propensity score matching may match highly unrelated units together. To overcome this problem, we develop theoretical results which motivate the use of neural networks to obtain non-trivial, multivariate balancing scores of a chosen level of coarseness, in contrast to the classical, scalar propensity score. We leverage these balancing scores to perform matching for high-dimensional causal inference and call this procedure neural score matching. We show that our method is competitive against other matching approaches on semi-synthetic high-dimensional datasets, both in terms of treatment effect estimation and reducing imbalance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsiang-Chin Chien, Ching-Ping Wang, Jung-Chih Chen, Chia-Yen Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: The lung airway tree modeling is essential to work for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases, especially for X-Ray computed tomography (CT). The airway tree modeling on CT images can provide the experts with 3-dimension measurements like wall thickness, etc. This information can tremendously aid the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1-4]. Many scholars have attempted various ways to model the lung airway tree, which can be split into two major categories based on its nature. Namely, the model-based approach and the deep learning approach. The performance of a typical model-based approach usually depends on the manual tuning of the model parameter, which can be its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is its don't require a large amount of training data which can be beneficial for a small dataset like medical imaging. On the other hand, the performance of model-based may be a misconcep-tion [5,6].
  In recent years, deep learning has achieved good results in the field of medical image processing, and many scholars have used UNet-based methods in medical image segmentation [7-11]. Among all the variation of UNet, the UNet 3+ [11] have relatively good result compare to the rest of the variation of UNet. Therefor to further improve the accuracy of lung airway tree modeling, this study combines the Frangi filter [5] with UNet 3+ [11] to develop a dual-channel 3D UNet 3+. The Frangi filter is used to extracting vessel-like feature. The vessel-like feature then used as input to guide the dual-channel UNet 3+ training and testing procedures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyu Zhou, Shuo Huang, Han Feng, Puyu Wang, Ding-Xuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the generalization performance of non-parametric estimation for pairwise learning. Most of the existing work requires the hypothesis space to be convex or a VC-class, and the loss to be convex. However, these restrictive assumptions limit the applicability of the results in studying many popular methods, especially kernel methods and neural networks. We significantly relax these restrictive assumptions and establish a sharp oracle inequality of the empirical minimizer with a general hypothesis space for the Lipschitz continuous pairwise losses. As an example, we apply our general results to study pairwise least squares regression and derive an excess population risk bound that matches the minimax lower bound for the pointwise least squares regression. The key novelty lies in constructing a structured deep ReLU neural network to approximate the true predictor, and in designing a targeted hypothesis space composed of networks with this structure and controllable complexity. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This example demonstrates that the obtained general results indeed help us to explore the generalization performance on a variety of problems that cannot be handled by existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Linhart, Gabriel Victorino Cardoso, Alexandre Gramfort, Sylvain Le Corff, Pedro L. C. Rodrigues</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the parameters of a non-linear model that best explain observed data is a core task across scientific fields. When such models rely on complex simulators, evaluating the likelihood is typically intractable, making traditional inference methods such as MCMC inapplicable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) addresses this by training deep generative models to approximate the posterior distribution over parameters using simulated data. In this work, we consider the tall data setting, where multiple independent observations provide additional information, allowing sharper posteriors and improved parameter identifiability. Building on the flourishing score-based diffusion literature, F-NPSE (Geffner et al., 2023) estimates the tall data posterior by composing individual scores from a neural network trained only for a single context observation. This enables more flexible and simulation-efficient inference than alternative approaches for tall datasets in SBI. However, it relies on costly Langevin dynamics during sampling. We propose a new algorithm that eliminates the need for Langevin steps by explicitly approximating the diffusion process of the tall data posterior. Our method retains the advantages of compositional score-based inference while being significantly faster and more stable than F-NPSE. We demonstrate its improved performance on toy problems and standard SBI benchmarks, and showcase its scalability by applying it to a complex real-world model from computational neuroscience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tensors are a fundamental data structure for many scientific contexts, such as time series analysis, materials science, and physics, among many others. Improving our ability to produce and handle tensors is essential to efficiently address problems in these domains. In this paper, we show how to exploit the underlying symmetries of functions that map tensors to tensors. More concretely, we develop universally expressive equivariant machine learning architectures on tensors that exploit that, in many cases, these tensor functions are equivariant with respect to the diagonal action of the orthogonal, Lorentz, and/or symplectic groups. We showcase our results on three problems coming from material science, theoretical computer science, and time series analysis. For time series, we combine our method with the increasingly popular path signatures approach, which is also invariant with respect to reparameterizations. Our numerical experiments show that our equivariant models perform better than corresponding non-equivariant baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nayef Shkeir, Tobias Grafke</p>
<p>Abstract: Matrix evolution equations occur in many applications, such as dynamical Lyapunov/Sylvester systems or Riccati equations in optimization and stochastic control, machine learning or data assimilation. In many such problems, the dominant stability restriction is imposed by a stiff linear term, making standard explicit integrators impractical. Exponential time differencing (ETD) is known to produce highly stable numerical schemes by treating the linear term in an exact fashion. In particular, for stiff problems, ETD methods are the methods of choice. We extend ETD to matrix-valued evolution equations of the form $\dot Q = LQ + QR + N(Q,t)$ by deriving explicit matrix-ETD (METD) schemes. When $L$ and $R$ commute, we construct an explicit $p$-th order METD$p$ family and prove order-$p$ global convergence under standard assumptions; for the non-commuting case, we develop a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-based extension. This allows us to produce highly efficient and stable integration schemes. We demonstrate efficiency and applicability on stiff PDE-derived and large-scale matrix dynamics, including an Allen-Cahn system, turbulent jet fluctuation statistics, and continuous graph neural networks. We further show that the scheme is more accurate, stable, and efficient than competing schemes in large-scale high-rank stiff systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cristian Daniel P\u{a}duraru, Antonio B\u{a}rb\u{a}lau, Radu Filipescu, Andrei Liviu Nicolicioiu, Elena Burceanu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current methods for detecting spurious correlations rely on analyzing dataset statistics or error patterns, leaving many harmful shortcuts invisible when counterexamples are absent. We introduce BEE (Bridging Explainability and Embeddings), a framework that shifts the focus from model predictions to the weight space, and to the embedding geometry underlying decisions. By analyzing how fine-tuning perturbs pretrained representations, BEE uncovers spurious correlations that remain hidden from conventional evaluation pipelines. We use linear probing as a transparent diagnostic lens, revealing spurious features that not only persist after full fine-tuning but also transfer across diverse state-of-the-art models. Our experiments cover numerous datasets and domains: vision (Waterbirds, CelebA, ImageNet-1k), language (CivilComments, MIMIC-CXR medical notes), and multiple embedding families (CLIP, CLIP-DataComp.XL, mGTE, BLIP2, SigLIP2). BEE consistently exposes spurious correlations: from concepts that slash the ImageNet accuracy by up to 95%, to clinical shortcuts in MIMIC-CXR notes that induce dangerous false negatives. Together, these results position BEE as a general and principled tool for diagnosing spurious correlations in weight space, enabling principled dataset auditing and more trustworthy foundation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiankun Wei, Abdulrahman Abdulrazzag, Tianchen Zhang, Adel Muursepp, Gururaj Saileshwar</p>
<p>Abstract: Deployed large language models (LLMs) often rely on speculative decoding, a technique that generates and verifies multiple candidate tokens in parallel, to improve throughput and latency. In this work, we reveal a new side-channel whereby input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect speculations can be inferred by monitoring per-iteration token counts or packet sizes. In evaluations using research prototypes and production-grade vLLM serving frameworks, we show that an adversary monitoring these patterns can fingerprint user queries (from a set of 50 prompts) with over 75% accuracy across four speculative-decoding schemes at temperature 0.3: REST (100%), LADE (91.6%), BiLD (95.2%), and EAGLE (77.6%). Even at temperature 1.0, accuracy remains far above the 2% random baseline - REST (99.6%), LADE (61.2%), BiLD (63.6%), and EAGLE (24%). We also show the capability of the attacker to leak confidential datastore contents used for prediction at rates exceeding 25 tokens/sec. To defend against these, we propose and evaluate a suite of mitigations, including packet padding and iteration-wise token aggregation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikha Pentyala, Geetha Sitaraman, Trae Claar, Martine De Cock</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of AI is based on the availability of data to train models. While in some cases a single data custodian may have sufficient data to enable AI, often multiple custodians need to collaborate to reach a cumulative size required for meaningful AI research. The latter is, for example, often the case for rare diseases, with each clinical site having data for only a small number of patients. Recent algorithms for federated synthetic data generation are an important step towards collaborative, privacy-preserving data sharing. Existing techniques, however, focus exclusively on synthesizer training, assuming that the training data is already preprocessed and that the desired synthetic data can be delivered in one shot, without any hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end collaborative framework for publishing of synthetic data that accounts for privacy-preserving preprocessing as well as evaluation. We instantiate this framework with Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols and evaluate it in a use case for privacy-preserving publishing of synthetic genomic data for leukemia.</p>

<p>Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly used to automate or aid human decisions, yet recent research shows that these algorithms may exhibit bias across legally protected demographic groups. However, data on these groups may be unavailable to organizations or external auditors due to privacy legislation. This paper studies bias detection using an unsupervised bias detection tool when data on demographic groups are unavailable. We collaborated with the Dutch Executive Agency for Education to audit an algorithm that was used to assign risk scores to college students at the national level in the Netherlands between 2012-2023. Our audit covers more than 250,000 students across the country. The unsupervised bias detection tool highlights known disparities between students with a non-European migration background and students with a Dutch or European-migration background. Our contributions are two-fold: (1) we assess bias in a real-world, large-scale, and high-stakes decision-making process by a governmental organization; (2) we provide the unsupervised bias detection tool in an open-source library for others to use to complete bias audits. Our work serves as a starting point for a deliberative assessment by human experts to evaluate potential discrimination in algorithmic decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Bravin, Massimo Pavan, Hazem Hesham Yousef Shalby, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer architectures based on the attention mechanism have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), driving major breakthroughs across virtually every NLP task. However, their substantial memory and computational requirements still hinder deployment on ultra-constrained devices such as wearables and Internet-of-Things (IoT) units, where available memory is limited to just a few megabytes. To address this challenge, we introduce EmbBERT, a tiny language model (TLM) architecturally designed for extreme efficiency. The model integrates a compact embedding layer, streamlined feed-forward blocks, and an efficient attention mechanism that together enable optimal performance under strict memory budgets. Through this redesign for the extreme edge, we demonstrate that highly simplified transformer architectures remain remarkably effective under tight resource constraints. EmbBERT requires only 2 MB of total memory, and achieves accuracy performance comparable to the ones of state-of-the-art (SotA) models that require a $\mathbf{10\times}$ memory budget. Extensive experiments on the curated TinyNLP benchmark and the GLUE suite confirm that EmbBERT achieves competitive accuracy, comparable to that of larger SotA models, and consistently outperforms downsized versions of BERT and MAMBA of similar size. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model resilience to 8-bit quantization, which further reduces memory usage to just 781 kB , and the scalability of the EmbBERT architecture across the sub-megabyte to tens-of-megabytes range. Finally, we perform an ablation study demonstrating the positive contributions of all components and the pre-training procedure.

<p>Abstract: As humans increasingly share environments with diverse agents powered by RL, LLMs, and beyond, the ability to explain agent policies in natural language is vital for reliable coexistence. We introduce a general-purpose framework that trains explanation-generating LLMs via reinforcement learning from AI feedback, with distributional rewards generated by generative continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). CNFs capture the pluralistic and probabilistic nature of human judgments about explanations. Moreover, under mild assumptions, CNFs provably bound deviations from true human reward distributions when trained on noisy proxy rewards from LLMs. We design a specialized CNF architecture that selectively attends to linguistic cues in the decision context and explanations when generating rewards. Human and LLM evaluators find that our method delivers explanations that enable more accurate predictions of true agent decisions, exhibit greater logical soundness and actionability, and impose lower cognitive load than explanations trained with proxy LLM rewards or state-of-the-art RLHF and RLAIF baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshay Kudva, Wei-Ting Tang, Joel A. Paulson</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing modern industrial systems requires balancing several competing objectives, such as profitability, resilience, and sustainability, while accounting for complex interactions between technological, economic, and environmental factors. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are commonly used to navigate these tradeoffs, but selecting the appropriate algorithm to tackle these problems is often unclear, particularly when system representations vary from fully equation-based (white-box) to entirely data-driven (black-box) models. While grey-box MOO methods attempt to bridge this gap, they typically impose rigid assumptions on system structure, requiring models to conform to the underlying structural assumptions of the solver rather than the solver adapting to the natural representation of the system of interest. In this chapter, we introduce a unifying approach to grey-box MOO by leveraging network representations, which provide a general and flexible framework for modeling interconnected systems as a series of function nodes that share various inputs and outputs. Specifically, we propose MOBONS, a novel Bayesian optimization-inspired algorithm that can efficiently optimize general function networks, including those with cyclic dependencies, enabling the modeling of feedback loops, recycle streams, and multi-scale simulations - features that existing methods fail to capture. Furthermore, MOBONS incorporates constraints, supports parallel evaluations, and preserves the sample efficiency of Bayesian optimization while leveraging network structure for improved scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MOBONS through two case studies, including one related to sustainable process design. By enabling efficient MOO under general graph representations, MOBONS has the potential to significantly enhance the design of more profitable, resilient, and sustainable engineering systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Marino (RAINBOW, UR, CNRS), Esteban Restrepo (RAINBOW), Claudio Pacchierotti (RAINBOW, IRISA), Paolo Robuffo Giordano (RAINBOW)</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of allocating heterogeneous resources among multiple agents in a decentralized manner. Our proposed method, Liquid-Graph-Time Clustering-IPPO, builds upon Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) by integrating dynamic cluster consensus, a mechanism that allows agents to form and adapt local sub-teams based on resource demands. This decentralized coordination strategy reduces reliance on global information and enhances scalability. We evaluate LGTC-IPPO against standard multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines and a centralized expert solution across a range of team sizes and resource distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that LGTC-IPPO achieves more stable rewards, better coordination, and robust performance even as the number of agents or resource types increases. Additionally, we illustrate how dynamic clustering enables agents to reallocate resources efficiently also for scenarios with discharging resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengqi Lou, Kabir Aladin Verchand, Sara Fridovich-Keil, Ashwin Pananjady</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of signal reconstruction for computed tomography (CT) under a nonlinear forward model that accounts for exponential signal attenuation, a polychromatic X-ray source, general measurement noise (e.g., Poisson shot noise), and observations acquired over multiple wavelength windows. We develop a simple iterative algorithm for single-material reconstruction, which we call EXACT (EXtragradient Algorithm for Computed Tomography), based on formulating our estimate as the fixed point of a monotone variational inequality. We prove guarantees on the statistical and computational performance of EXACT under realistic assumptions on the measurement process. We also consider a recently introduced variant of this model with Gaussian measurements and present sample and iteration complexity bounds for EXACT that improve upon those of existing algorithms. We apply our EXACT algorithm to a CT phantom image recovery task and show that it often requires fewer X-ray views, lower source intensity, and less computation time to achieve reconstruction quality similar to existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqi Liu, Yunzhu Li, Kris Hauser</p>
<p>Abstract: Predictive models can be particularly helpful for robots to effectively manipulate terrains in construction sites and extraterrestrial surfaces. However, terrain state representations become extremely high-dimensional especially to capture fine-resolution details and when depth is unknown or unbounded. This paper introduces a learning-based approach for terrain dynamics modeling and manipulation, leveraging the Graph-based Neural Dynamics (GBND) framework to represent terrain deformation as motion of a graph of particles. Based on the principle that the moving portion of a terrain is usually localized, our approach builds a large terrain graph (potentially millions of particles) but only identifies a very small active subgraph (hundreds of particles) for predicting the outcomes of robot-terrain interaction. To minimize the size of the active subgraph we introduce a learning-based approach that identifies a small region of interest (RoI) based on the robot's control inputs and the current scene. We also introduce a novel domain boundary feature encoding that allows GBNDs to perform accurate dynamics prediction in the RoI interior while avoiding particle penetration through RoI boundaries. Our proposed method is both orders of magnitude faster than naive GBND and it achieves better overall prediction accuracy. We further evaluated our framework on excavation and shaping tasks on terrain with different granularity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokun Liu, Sicong Huang, Jingyu Hu, Yangqiaoyu Zhou, Chenhao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: There is growing interest in hypothesis generation with large language models (LLMs). However, fundamental questions remain: what makes a good hypothesis, and how can we systematically evaluate methods for hypothesis generation? To address this, we introduce HypoBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs and hypothesis generation methods across multiple aspects, including practical utility, generalizability, and hypothesis discovery rate. HypoBench includes 7 real-world tasks and 5 synthetic tasks with 194 distinct datasets. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs combined with six existing hypothesis-generation methods. Overall, our results suggest that existing methods are capable of discovering valid and novel patterns in the data. However, the results from synthetic datasets indicate that there is still significant room for improvement, as current hypothesis generation methods do not fully uncover all relevant or meaningful patterns. Specifically, in synthetic settings, as task difficulty increases, performance significantly drops, with best models and methods only recovering 38.8% of the ground-truth hypotheses. These findings highlight challenges in hypothesis generation and demonstrate that HypoBench serves as a valuable resource for improving AI systems designed to assist scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Kouchly, Ben Finkelshtein, Michael Bronstein, Ron Levie</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ambedkar Dukkipati, Kawin Mayilvaghanan, Naveen Kumar Pallekonda, Sai Prakash Hadnoor, Ranga Shaarad Ayyagari</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluctuations in stock prices are influenced by a complex interplay of factors that go beyond mere historical data. These factors, themselves influenced by external forces, encompass inter-stock dynamics, broader economic factors, various government policy decisions, outbreaks of wars, etc. Furthermore, all of these factors are dynamic and exhibit changes over time. In this paper, for the first time, we tackle the forecasting problem under external influence by proposing learning mechanisms that not only learn from historical trends but also incorporate external knowledge from temporal knowledge graphs. Since there are no such datasets or temporal knowledge graphs available, we study this problem with stock market data, and we construct comprehensive temporal knowledge graph datasets. In our proposed approach, we model relations on external temporal knowledge graphs as events of a Hawkes process on graphs. With extensive experiments, we show that learned dynamic representations effectively rank stocks based on returns across multiple holding periods, outperforming related baselines on relevant metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xixuan Hao, Yutian Jiang, Xingchen Zou, Jiabo Liu, Yifang Yin, Song Gao, Flora Salim, Tianrui Li, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to transform location-centric geospatial data into meaningful computational representations has become fundamental to modern spatial analysis and decision-making. Geospatial Representation Learning (GRL), the process of automatically extracting latent structures and semantic patterns from geographic data, is undergoing a profound transformation through two successive technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured and semi-structured geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological perspective, and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future research directions in the LLM and foundation model era. This work offers a thorough exploration of the field and provides a roadmap for further innovation in GRL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antony Sikorski, Michael Ivanitskiy, Nathan Lenssen, Douglas Nychka, Daniel McKenzie</p>
<p>Abstract: In many applications, we wish to fit a parametric statistical model to a small ensemble of spatially distributed random variables ('fields'). However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus, many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image (I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Ting Lee, Fu-Chieh Chang, Yu-En Shu, Hui-Ying Shih, Pei-Yuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its mechanism remains unclear. We show that intrinsic self-correction functions by steering hidden representations along interpretable latent directions, as evidenced by both alignment analysis and activation interventions. To achieve this, we analyze intrinsic self-correction via the representation shift induced by prompting. In parallel, we construct interpretable latent directions with contrastive pairs and verify the causal effect of these directions via activation addition. Evaluating six open-source LLMs, our results demonstrate that prompt-induced representation shifts in text detoxification and text toxification consistently align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These findings suggest that representation steering is the mechanistic driver of intrinsic self-correction. Our analysis highlights that understanding model internals offers a direct route to analyzing the mechanisms of prompt-driven LLM behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Li, Chen Chen, Yuchen Hu, Yanjun Gao, Xi Wang, Emine Yilmaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chika Maduabuchi, Hao Chen, Yujin Han, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative quality for image and video generation; however, they remain brittle under noisy conditioning, where small perturbations in text or multimodal embeddings can cascade over timesteps and cause semantic drift. Existing corruption strategies from image diffusion (e.g., Gaussian, Uniform) fail in video settings because static noise disrupts temporal fidelity. In this paper, we propose CAT-LVDM, a corruption-aware training framework with structured, data-aligned noise injection tailored for video diffusion. Our two operators, Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI) and Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), align perturbations with batch semantics or spectral dynamics to preserve coherence. CAT-LVDM yields substantial gains: BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9 percent on WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN improves UCF-101 by 12.3 percent, outperforming Gaussian, Uniform, and large diffusion baselines such as DEMO (2.3B) and LaVie (3B) despite training on 5x less data. Ablations confirm the unique value of low-rank, data-aligned noise, and theoretical analysis establishes why these operators tighten robustness and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM thus introduces a principled framework for robust video diffusion and further demonstrates transferability to autoregressive generation and multimodal video understanding models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of soft-tissue interactions is fundamental for advancing surgical simulation, surgical robotics, and model-based surgical automation. To achieve real-time latency, classical Finite Element Method (FEM) solvers are often replaced with neural approximations; however, naively training such models in a fully data-driven manner without incorporating physical priors frequently leads to poor generalization and physically implausible predictions. We present a novel physics-informed neural simulation framework that enables real-time prediction of soft-tissue deformations under complex single- and multi-grasper interactions. Our approach integrates Kelvinlet-based analytical priors with large-scale FEM data, capturing both linear and nonlinear tissue responses. This hybrid design improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility across diverse neural architectures while maintaining the low-latency performance required for interactive applications. We validate our method on challenging surgical manipulation tasks involving standard laparoscopic grasping tools, demonstrating substantial improvements in deformation fidelity and temporal stability over existing baselines. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a principled and computationally efficient paradigm for real-time, physics-aware soft-tissue simulation in surgical AI.</p>

These methods employ dynamically updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Korkut Anapa, \.Ismail G\"uzel, Ceylan Yozgatl{\i}gil</p>
<p>Abstract: In Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments, forecasting Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) is critical for data-driven operational control and predictive maintenance. However, the highly volatile and nonlinear nature of OEE time series--particularly in complex production lines and hydraulic press systems--limits the effectiveness of forecasting. This study proposes a novel informational framework that leverages Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to transform raw OEE data into structured engineering knowledge for production management.
  The framework models hourly OEE data from production lines and systems using persistent homology to extract large-scale topological features that characterize intrinsic operational behaviors. These features are integrated into a SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors) architecture, where TDA components serve as exogenous variables to capture latent temporal structures. Experimental results demonstrate forecasting accuracy improvements of at least 17% over standard seasonal benchmarks, with Heat Kernel-based features consistently identified as the most effective predictors.
  The proposed framework was deployed in a Global Lighthouse Network manufacturing facility, providing a new strategic layer for production management and achieving a 7.4% improvement in total OEE. This research contributes a formal methodology for embedding topological signatures into classical stochastic models to enhance decision-making in knowledge-intensive production systems.</p>

OrbitChain uses a pipelined design to decompose workflows into analytics functions, and orchestrates constellation-wide resources to finish real-time analytics tasks. It provides timely insights to Earth sensing applications and enables advanced workflows like in-orbit tip-and-cue. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments show that OrbitChain can deliver analytics results in minutes, supports up to 60% more analytics workload than existing frameworks, and reduces inter-satellite communication overhead by up to 45%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhou Wang, Hanxun Huang, Guansong Pang, Sarah Erfani, Christopher Leckie</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech synthesis systems can now produce highly realistic vocalisations that pose significant authenticity challenges. Despite substantial progress in deepfake detection models, their real-world effectiveness is often undermined by evolving distribution shifts between training and test data, driven by the complexity of human speech and the rapid evolution of synthesis systems. Existing datasets suffer from limited real speech diversity, insufficient coverage of recent synthesis systems, and heterogeneous mixtures of deepfake sources, which hinder systematic evaluation and open-world model training. To address these issues, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale and highly diverse deepfake audio dataset comprising over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders, totalling 3 million clips. We further observe that most existing detectors default to binary supervised training, which can induce negative transfer across synthesis sources when the training data contains highly diverse deepfake patterns, impacting overall generalisation. As a complementary contribution, we propose an effective curriculum-learning-based approach to mitigate this effect. Extensive experiments show that existing detection models struggle to generalise to novel deepfakes and human speech in AUDETER, whereas XLR-based detectors trained on AUDETER achieve strong cross-domain performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an EER of 1.87% on In-the-Wild. AUDETER is available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to create a standard for how Large Language Models use tools. However, most current research focuses on selecting tools from an existing pool. A more fundamental, yet largely overlooked, problem is how to populate this pool by converting the vast number of existing software projects into MCP-compatible services. To bridge this gap, we introduce Code2MCP, an agent-based framework that automatically transforms a GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Code2MCP employs a multi-agent workflow for code analysis, environment setup, tool function design, and service generation, enhanced by a self-correcting loop to ensure reliability. We demonstrate that Code2MCP successfully transforms open-source computing libraries in scientific fields such as bioinformatics, mathematics, and fluid dynamics that are not available in existing MCP servers. By providing a novel automated pathway to unlock GitHub, the world's largest code repository, for the MCP ecosystem, Code2MCP serves as a catalyst to significantly accelerate the protocol's adoption and practical application.

<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL fits the definition of learning; however, its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that, empirically, ICL is limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. Namely, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies and on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism for learning, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobo Xing, Wei Yuan, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Xiangliang Zhang, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with precise semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both modalities for every query-table pair within large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight 2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path (Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair, reducing redundancy and avoiding conflicts that arise when textual and visual views of the same table provide inconsistent cues. By routing to the most appropriate view, our framework improves both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of 4.02%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriela Pinto, Palash Goyal, Mihir Parmar, Yiwen Song, Souradip Chakraborty, Zifeng Wang, Jingsun Yoon, Hamid Palangi, Tomas Pfister</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling has significantly improved how AI models solve problems, yet current methods often get stuck in repetitive, incorrect patterns of thought. We introduce HEART, a framework that uses emotional cues to guide the model's focus, much like how feelings contribute to human decision-making. By alternating between critical tones to sharpen error detection and encouraging tones to spark new ideas, HEART helps the model break out of dead-end reasoning and find the right solution. We evaluate HEART across seven high-difficulty benchmarks--including Humanity's Last Exam, GPQA Diamond, and LiveCodeBench--demonstrating robustness across diverse models. Results show that emotion facilitates deeper reasoning, yielding consistent accuracy gains over affect-sterile baselines. These findings suggest that the next frontier in machine reasoning lies in the strategic integration of affective regulation to guide logical synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijia Dou, Xu Zhang, Yi Bin, Jian Liu, Bo Peng, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicol\`o Dal Fabbro, Milad Mesbahi, Renato Mendes, Jo\~ao Borges de Sousa, George J. Pappas</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dwip Dalal, Gautam Vashishtha, Utkarsh Mishra, Jeonghwan Kim, Madhav Kanda, Hyeonjeong Ha, Svetlana Lazebnik, Heng Ji, Unnat Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas, all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image, reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important, without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when given such warped inputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Tang, Arwa Dabbech, Adrian Jackson, Yves Wiaux</p>
<p>Abstract: The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure (FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularization step via learned denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension, underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighboring channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained with a Jacobian regularization enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a variant of the optimization-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity across spectral channels via the $\ell_{2,1}$-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its superior performance compared to its optimization-based counterpart Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dechen Zhang, Junwei Su, Difan Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of low-bit quantization has emerged as an indispensable technique for enabling the efficient training of large-scale models. Despite its widespread empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on learning performance remains notably absent, even in the simplest linear regression setting. We present the first systematic theoretical study of this fundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of quantization targets: data, label, parameter, activation, and gradient. Our novel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and data-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization affects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify noise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data quantization introduces additional approximation error. Crucially, we distinguish the effects of two quantization schemes: we prove that for additive quantization (with constant quantization steps), the noise amplification benefits from a suppression effect scaled by the batch size, while multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent quantization steps) largely preserves the spectral structure, thereby reducing the spectral distortion. Furthermore, under common polynomial-decay data spectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive quantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer quantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how quantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving the way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas P. Amaral, Luben M. C. Cabezas, Thiago R. Ramos, Gustavo H. G. A. Pereira</p>
<p>Abstract: Dirichlet regression models are suitable for compositional data, in which the response variable represents proportions that sum to one. However, there are still no well-established methods for constructing valid prediction sets in this context, especially considering the geometry of the compositional space. In this work, we investigate conformal prediction-based strategies for constructing valid predictive regions in Dirichlet regression models. We evaluate three distinct approaches: a method based on quantile residuals, an approximate construction of highest density regions (HDR), and an adaptation of the approximate HDR using grid-based discretization over the simplex. The performance of the methods was analyzed through simulation studies under different scenarios, varying the model complexity, response dimensionality, and covariate structure. The results indicated that the HDR approximation approach exhibits good robustness in terms of coverage, while the grid discretization proved effective in reducing overcoverage and the area of the prediction region compared to the original method. The quantile method provided larger prediction regions compared to the grid method, while maintaining adequate coverage. The methodologies were also applied to two real datasets: one concerning sleep stages and another on biomass allocation in plants. In both cases, the proposed methods demonstrated practical feasibility and produced coherent interpretations within the compositional space. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of this work</p>

<p>Abstract: While current navigation benchmarks prioritize task success in simplified settings, they neglect the multidimensional economic constraints essential for the real-world commercialization of autonomous delivery systems. We introduce CostNav, an Economic Navigation Benchmark that evaluates physical AI agents through comprehensive economic cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. By integrating industry-standard data - such as SEC filings and AIS injury reports - with Isaac Sim's detailed collision and cargo dynamics, CostNav transcends simple task completion to accurately evaluate business value in complex, real-world scenarios. To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability, revealing that optimizing for task success on a simplified task fundamentally differs from optimizing for real-world economic deployment. Our evaluation of rule-based Nav2 navigation shows that current approaches are not economically viable: the contribution margin is -22.81/run (AMCL) and -12.87/run (GPS), resulting in no break-even point. We challenge the community to develop navigation policies that achieve economic viability on CostNav. We remain method-agnostic, evaluating success solely on the metric of cost rather than the underlying architecture. All resources are available at https://github.com/worv-ai/CostNav.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03048">The Specification Trap: Why Content-Based AI Value Alignment Cannot Produce Robust Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Austin Spizzirri</p>
<p>Abstract: I argue that content-based AI value alignment--any approach that treats alignment as optimizing toward a formal value-object (reward function, utility function, constitutional principles, or learned preference representation)--cannot, by itself, produce robust alignment under capability scaling, distributional shift, and increasing autonomy. This limitation arises from three philosophical results: Hume's is-ought gap (behavioral data cannot entail normative conclusions), Berlin's value pluralism (human values are irreducibly plural and incommensurable), and the extended frame problem (any value encoding will misfit future contexts that advanced AI creates). I show that RLHF, Constitutional AI, inverse reinforcement learning, and cooperative assistance games each instantiate this specification trap, and that their failure modes are structural, not engineering limitations. Proposed escape routes--continual updating, meta-preferences, moral realism--relocate the trap rather than exit it. Drawing on Fischer and Ravizza's compatibilist theory, I argue that behavioral compliance does not constitute alignment: there is a principled distinction between simulated value-following and genuine reasons-responsiveness, and specification-based methods cannot produce the latter. The specification trap establishes a ceiling on content-based approaches, not their uselessness--but this ceiling becomes safety-critical at the capability frontier. The alignment problem must be reframed from value specification to value emergence.</p>

While such reasoning-centric approaches have been proven effective in language and vision tasks, their extension to 3D remains underdeveloped. CoRe3D introduces a unified 3D understanding and generation reasoning framework that jointly operates over semantic and spatial abstractions, enabling high-level intent inferred from language to directly guide low-level 3D content formation. Central to this design is a spatially grounded reasoning representation that decomposes 3D latent space into localized regions, allowing the model to reason over geometry in a compositional and procedural manner. By tightly coupling semantic chain-of-thought inference with structured spatial reasoning, CoRe3D produces 3D outputs that exhibit strong local consistency and faithful alignment with linguistic descriptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI coding assistants produce vulnerable code in 45\% of security-relevant scenarios~\cite{veracode2025}, yet no public training dataset teaches both traditional web security and AI/ML-specific defenses in a format suitable for instruction tuning.
  We present SecureCode, a production-grade dataset of 2,185 multi-turn security training examples spanning two domains: web application security (1,435 examples covering the OWASP Top 10 2021 across 11 languages and 9 frameworks, 100\% grounded in documented CVEs and security incidents) and AI/ML security (750 examples covering all 10 OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 categories across more than 40 frameworks, including LangChain, OpenAI, and Hugging Face). Every example follows a 4-turn conversational structure -- feature request; vulnerable and secure implementations with attack demonstrations; advanced probing; and defense-in-depth operational guidance -- designed for direct use in instruction tuning pipelines.
  Quality assurance combines automated structural validation with multi-agent review from seven specialist AI perspectives (more than 10{,}500 assessments) and an 8-phase remediation pipeline, producing a rubric-calibrated mean quality score of 93.8/100 ($\sigma = 0.93$) for the AI/ML component. Each example provides SIEM integration strategies, infrastructure hardening recommendations, and testing approaches using production frameworks.
  We release the unified dataset on Hugging Face with domain-specific loading configurations (web, aiml, default), alongside eight fine-tuned open-source models (3B--20B parameters, QLoRA), and an evaluation framework with four security-specific metrics. To our knowledge, SecureCode is the first public dataset that jointly provides OWASP Top 10 2021 web coverage and OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 AI/ML coverage in a unified conversational schema suitable for instruction tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Jiang, Xindi Tong, Ziyao Liu, Xiaoxi Zhang, Kwok-Yan Lam, Chee Wei Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated unlearning has become an attractive approach to address privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning, for situations when sensitive data is remembered by AI models during the machine learning process. It enables the removal of specific data influences from trained models, aligning with the growing emphasis on the "right to be forgotten." While extensively studied in horizontal federated learning, unlearning in vertical federated learning (VFL) remains challenging due to the distributed feature architecture. VFL unlearning includes sample unlearning that removes specific data points' influence and label unlearning that removes entire classes. Since different parties hold complementary features of the same samples, unlearning tasks require cross-party coordination, creating computational overhead and complexities from feature interdependencies. To address such challenges, we propose FedORA (Federated Optimization for data Removal via primal-dual Algorithm), designed for sample and label unlearning in VFL. FedORA formulates the removal of certain samples or labels as a constrained optimization problem solved using a primal-dual framework. Our approach introduces a new unlearning loss function that promotes classification uncertainty rather than misclassification. An adaptive step size enhances stability, while an asymmetric batch design, considering the prior influence of the remaining data on the model, handles unlearning and retained data differently to efficiently reduce computational costs. We provide theoretical analysis proving that the model difference between FedORA and Train-from-scratch is bounded, establishing guarantees for unlearning effectiveness. Experiments on tabular and image datasets demonstrate that FedORA achieves unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch with reduced computation and communication overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Rozonoyer, Chong You, Michael Boratko, Himanshu Jain, Nilesh Gupta, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Andrew McCallum, Felix Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a shift toward generative approaches to retrieval and ranking, aiming to supersede classical Dual Encoders (DEs) and Cross Encoders (CEs). A prominent paradigm is pointwise Autoregressive Ranking (ARR), where an LLM generates document identifiers (docIDs) token-by-token to enable ranking via beam search. ARR offers the promise of superior expressivity compared to DEs while avoiding the prohibitive computational cost of CEs. However, a formal theoretical foundation for this expressive power has been missing. Moreover, the standard next-token prediction loss is rank-agnostic and inappropriate for finetuning an LLM for ranking tasks.
  In this paper, we first prove that the expressive capacity of ARR is strictly superior to DEs. While a DE requires an embedding dimension that grows linearly with corpus size to achieve arbitrary rankings, ARR can solve it with a constant hidden dimension. We then propose SToICaL (Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss), a generalized rank-aware training loss for LLM finetuning. By using item-level reweighting and prefix-tree marginalization, we distribute probability mass over valid docID tokens based on their ground-truth relevance. Experiments on WordNet and ESCI datasets verify that our loss suppresses invalid docID generations and significantly improves ranking metrics beyond top-1 retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marc Lanctot, Kate Larson, Ian Gemp, Michael Kaisers</p>
<p>Abstract: As intelligent agents become more generally-capable, i.e. able to master a wide variety of tasks, the complexity and cost of properly evaluating them rises significantly. Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixiang Sun, Pengchao Tian, Zihan Zhou, Jielei Zhang, Peiyi Li, Andrew L. Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning causal structures from observational data remains a fundamental yet computationally intensive task, particularly in high-dimensional settings where existing methods face challenges such as the super-exponential growth of the search space and increasing computational demands. To address this, we introduce VISTA (Voting-based Integration of Subgraph Topologies for Acyclicity), a modular framework that decomposes the global causal structure learning problem into local subgraphs based on Markov Blankets. The global integration is achieved through a weighted voting mechanism that penalizes low-support edges via exponential decay, filters unreliable ones with an adaptive threshold, and ensures acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm. The framework is model-agnostic, imposing no assumptions on the inductive biases of base learners, is compatible with arbitrary data settings without requiring specific structural forms, and fully supports parallelization. We also theoretically establish finite-sample error bounds for VISTA, and prove its asymptotic consistency under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of VISTA, yielding notable improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of base learners.</p>

Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengxuan Wang, Yuxin Chen, Gang Xu, Tao He, Hongjie Jiang, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04215">OAT: Ordered Action Tokenization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqi Liu, Xiaoshen Han, Jiawei Gao, Yue Zhao, Haonan Chen, Yilun Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Luthfi Shahab, Imam Mukhlash, Hadi Susanto</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates the use of shallow physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving forward and inverse problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). By reformulating PINNs as nonlinear systems, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is employed to efficiently optimize the network parameters. Analytical expressions for the neural network derivatives with respect to the input variables are derived, enabling accurate and efficient computation of the Jacobian matrix required by LM. The proposed approach is tested on several benchmark problems, including the Burgers, Schr\"odinger, Allen-Cahn, and three-dimensional Bratu equations. Numerical results demonstrate that LM significantly outperforms BFGS in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and final loss values, even when using shallow network architectures with only two hidden layers. These findings indicate that, for a wide class of PDEs, shallow PINNs combined with efficient second-order optimization methods can provide accurate and computationally efficient solutions for both forward and inverse problems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08520">Reinforcement Inference: Leveraging Uncertainty for Self-Correcting Language Model Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhai Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are often evaluated and deployed under a one-shot, greedy inference protocol, especially in professional settings that require deterministic behavior. This regime can systematically under-estimate a fixed model's true capability: many errors arise not from missing knowledge, but from premature commitment under internal ambiguity. We introduce Reinforcement Inference, an entropy-aware inference-time control strategy that uses the model's own uncertainty to selectively invoke a second, more deliberate reasoning attempt, enabling stronger performance without any retraining.
  On 12,032 MMLU-Pro questions across 14 subjects, using DeepSeek-v3.2 with deterministic decoding in a zero-shot setting, Reinforcement Inference improves accuracy from 60.72% to 84.03%, while only incurring 61.06% additional inference calls. A 100% re-asking ablation reaches 84.35%, indicating that uncertainty-aware selection captures most of the attainable improvement with substantially less compute. Moreover, a prompt-only ablation underperforms the baseline, suggesting that the gains are not explained by generic prompting alone.
  Beyond providing a practical inference-time upgrade, our results suggest a broader entropy-aware paradigm for measuring and expanding model capability: because modern decoder-based models generate outputs autoregressively, entropy and related confidence measures arise naturally as first-class control signals during generation. The resulting gap between one-pass greedy inference and uncertainty-conditioned deliberation offers a diagnostic lens on an LLM's latent reasoning horizon and motivates future training objectives that explicitly constrain correctness--confidence alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Unai Fischer-Abaigar, Emily Aiken, Christoph Kern, Juan Carlos Perdomo</p>
<p>Abstract: Institutions increasingly use prediction to allocate scarce resources. From a design perspective, better predictions compete with other investments, such as expanding capacity or improving treatment quality. Here, the big question is not how to solve a specific allocation problem, but rather which problem to solve. In this work, we develop an empirical toolkit to help planners form principled answers to this question and quantify the bottom-line welfare impact of investments in prediction versus other policy levers such as expanding capacity and improving treatment quality. Applying our framework in two real-world case studies on German employment services and poverty targeting in Ethiopia, we illustrate how decision-makers can reliably derive context-specific conclusions about the relative value of prediction in their allocation problem. We make our software toolkit, rvp, and parts of our data available in order to enable future empirical work in this area.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08835">Learning the Value Systems of Societies with Preference-based Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es Holgado-S\'anchez, Peter Vamplew, Richard Dazeley, Sascha Ossowski, Holger Billhardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Value-aware AI should recognise human values and adapt to the value systems (value-based preferences) of different users. This requires operationalization of values, which can be prone to misspecification. The social nature of values demands their representation to adhere to multiple users while value systems are diverse, yet exhibit patterns among groups. In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.
  We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system. We evaluate our method against a state-of-the-art PbMORL algorithm and baselines on two MDPs with human values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Gardiner, Orlando Romero, Brendan Tivnan, Nicol\`o Dal Fabbro, George J. Pappas</p>
<p>Abstract: The inability to communicate poses a major challenge to coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daisuke Nohara, Taishi Nakamura, Rio Yokota</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning substantially improves reasoning in large language models, but it also tends to lengthen chain of thought outputs and increase computational cost during both training and inference. Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training alignment is central to deploying large language models (LLMs), yet practical workflows remain split across backend-specific tools and ad-hoc glue code, making experiments hard to reproduce. We identify backend interference, reward fragmentation, and irreproducible pipelines as key obstacles in alignment research. We introduce AlignTune, a modular toolkit exposing a unified interface for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RLHF-style optimization with interchangeable TRL and Unsloth backends. AlignTune standardizes configuration, provides an extensible reward layer (rule-based and learned), and integrates evaluation over standard benchmarks and custom tasks. By isolating backend-specific logic behind a single factory boundary, AlignTune enables controlled comparisons and reproducible alignment experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Wang, Canwen Xu, Boyi Liu, Yite Wang, Siwei Han, Zhewei Yao, Huaxiu Yao, Yuxiong He</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.
