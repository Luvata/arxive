<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Ferrante, Tommaso Boccato, Grigorii Rashkov, Nicola Toschi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach towards creating a foundational model for aligning neural data and visual stimuli across multimodal representationsof brain activity by leveraging contrastive learning. We used electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our framework's capabilities are demonstrated through three key experiments: decoding visual information from neural data, encoding images into neural representations, and converting between neural modalities. The results highlight the model's ability to accurately capture semantic information across different brain imaging techniques, illustrating its potential in decoding, encoding, and modality conversion tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> BoHao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial multi-view clustering (PVC) presents significant challenges practical research problem for data analysis in real-world applications, especially when some views of the data are partially missing. Existing clustering methods struggle to handle incomplete views effectively, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a novel dual optimization framework based on contrastive learning, which aims to maximize the consistency of latent features in incomplete multi-view data and improve clustering performance through deep learning models. By combining a fine-tuned Vision Transformer and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), we fill in missing views and dynamically adjust view weights using self-supervised learning and meta-learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art clustering models on the BDGP and HW datasets, particularly in handling complex and incomplete multi-view data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiang Li, George Teodoro, Yi Jiang, Jun Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trevor Seets, Andreas Velten</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) is a promising surgical technique that gives surgeons a unique view of tissue that is used to guide their practice by delineating tissue types and diseased areas. As new fluorescent contrast agents are developed that have low fluorescent photon yields, it becomes increasingly important to develop computational models to allow FGS systems to maintain good video quality in real time environments. To further complicate this task, FGS has a difficult bias noise term from laser leakage light (LLL) that represents unfiltered excitation light that can be on the order of the fluorescent signal. Most conventional video denoising methods focus on zero mean noise, and non-causal processing, both of which are violated in FGS. Luckily in FGS, often a co-located reference video is also captured which we use to simulate the LLL and assist in the denoising processes. In this work, we propose an accurate noise simulation pipeline that includes LLL and propose three baseline deep learning based algorithms for FGS video denoising.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09822">A Self-Supervised Model for Multi-modal Stroke Risk Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Camille Delgrange, Olga Demler, Samia Mora, Bjoern Menze, Ezequiel de la Rosa, Neda Davoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting stroke risk is a complex challenge that can be enhanced by integrating diverse clinically available data modalities. This study introduces a self-supervised multimodal framework that combines 3D brain imaging, clinical data, and image-derived features to improve stroke risk prediction prior to onset. By leveraging large unannotated clinical datasets, the framework captures complementary and synergistic information across image and tabular data modalities. Our approach is based on a contrastive learning framework that couples contrastive language-image pretraining with an image-tabular matching module, to better align multimodal data representations in a shared latent space. The model is trained on the UK Biobank, which includes structural brain MRI and clinical data. We benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal methods using tabular, image, and image-tabular combinations under diverse frozen and trainable model settings. The proposed model outperformed self-supervised tabular (image) methods by 2.6% (2.6%) in ROC-AUC and by 3.3% (5.6%) in balanced accuracy. Additionally, it showed a 7.6% increase in balanced accuracy compared to the best multimodal supervised model. Through interpretable tools, our approach demonstrated better integration of tabular and image data, providing richer and more aligned embeddings. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping heatmaps further revealed activated brain regions commonly associated in the literature with brain aging, stroke risk, and clinical outcomes. This robust self-supervised multimodal framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods for stroke risk prediction and offers a strong foundation for future studies integrating diverse data modalities to advance clinical predictive modelling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yian Wang, Xiaowen Qiu, Jiageng Liu, Zhehuan Chen, Jiting Cai, Yufei Wang, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Zhou Xian, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating large-scale interactive 3D environments is essential for the development of Robotics and Embodied AI research. Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Zhou, Huaisheng Zhu, Rohan Sharma, Ruiyi Zhang, Kaiyi Ji, Changyou Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual generation. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as a generative prior to solve general inverse problems. Current posterior sampling based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into the posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e., clean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency information can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could induce larger posterior estimate errors during the restoration sampling. To address this issue, we first reveal that forming the log posterior gradient with the noisy measurement ( i.e., samples from a diffusion forward process) instead of the clean one can benefit the reverse process. Consequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM, which incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., samples generated by a reverse denoising process, compared to random sampling with noise in standard methods) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the misalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such as Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and tasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09858">Masked Image Contrastive Learning for Efficient Visual Conceptual Pre-training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Yang, Lijian Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable and straightforward pre-training paradigm for efficient visual conceptual representation called masked image contrastive learning (MiCL). Our MiCL approach is simple: we randomly mask patches to generate different views within an image and contrast them among a mini-batch of images. The core idea behind MiCL consists of two designs. First, masked tokens have the potential to significantly diminish the conceptual redundancy inherent in images, and create distinct views with substantial fine-grained differences on the semantic concept level instead of the instance level. Second, contrastive learning is adept at extracting high-level semantic conceptual features during the pre-training, circumventing the high-frequency interference and additional costs associated with image reconstruction. Importantly, MiCL learns highly semantic conceptual representations efficiently without relying on hand-crafted data augmentations or additional auxiliary modules. Empirically, MiCL demonstrates high scalability with Vision Transformers, as the ViT-L/16 can complete pre-training in 133 hours using only 4 A100 GPUs, achieving 85.8% accuracy in downstream fine-tuning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Cao, Xiangyi Chen, Bo Liu, Ming Ding, Rong Xie, Li Song, Zhu Li, Wenjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of image acquisition technologies, along with advances in facial recognition, has raised serious privacy concerns. Face de-identification usually refers to the process of concealing or replacing personal identifiers, which is regarded as an effective means to protect the privacy of facial images. A significant number of methods for face de-identification have been proposed in recent years. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art face de-identification methods, categorized into three levels: pixel-level, representation-level, and semantic-level techniques. We systematically evaluate these methods based on two key criteria, the effectiveness of privacy protection and preservation of image utility, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Our analysis includes qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the main algorithms, demonstrating that deep learning-based approaches, particularly those using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models, have achieved significant advancements in balancing privacy and utility. Experimental results reveal that while recent methods demonstrate strong privacy protection, trade-offs remain in visual fidelity and computational complexity. This survey not only summarizes the current landscape but also identifies key challenges and future research directions in face de-identification.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09871">Content-Aware Preserving Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Giang H. Le, Anh Q. Nguyen, Byeongkeun Kang, Yeejin Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Remarkable progress has been achieved in image generation with the introduction of generative models. However, precisely controlling the content in generated images remains a challenging task due to their fundamental training objective. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel image generation framework explicitly designed to incorporate desired content in output images. The framework utilizes advanced encoding techniques, integrating subnetworks called content fusion and frequency encoding modules. The frequency encoding module first captures features and structures of reference images by exclusively focusing on selected frequency components. Subsequently, the content fusion module generates a content-guiding vector that encapsulates desired content features. During the image generation process, content-guiding vectors from real images are fused with projected noise vectors. This ensures the production of generated images that not only maintain consistent content from guiding images but also exhibit diverse stylistic variations. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in preserving content attributes, extensive experiments are conducted on widely used benchmark datasets, including Flickr-Faces-High Quality, Animal Faces High Quality, and Large-scale Scene Understanding datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faith Johnson, Bryan Bo Cao, Ashwin Ashok, Shubham Jain, Kristin Dana</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual navigation takes inspiration from humans, who navigate in previously unseen environments using vision without detailed environment maps. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel no-RL, no-graph, no-odometry approach to visual navigation using feudal learning to build a three tiered agent. Key to our approach is a memory proxy map (MPM), an intermediate representation of the environment learned in a self-supervised manner by the high-level manager agent that serves as a simplified memory, approximating what the agent has seen. We demonstrate that recording observations in this learned latent space is an effective and efficient memory proxy that can remove the need for graphs and odometry in visual navigation tasks. For the mid-level manager agent, we develop a waypoint network (WayNet) that outputs intermediate subgoals, or waypoints, imitating human waypoint selection during local navigation. For the low-level worker agent, we learn a classifier over a discrete action space that avoids local obstacles and moves the agent towards the WayNet waypoint. The resulting feudal navigation network offers a novel approach with no RL, no graph, no odometry, and no metric map; all while achieving SOTA results on the image goal navigation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyan Huang, Weiqin Zhao, Yihang Chen, Yu Fu, Lequan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis is gaining prominence within the medical imaging field. Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE. The source code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CATE.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce DiffFNO, a novel diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale super-resolution strengthened by a Weighted Fourier Neural Operator (WFNO). Mode Re-balancing in WFNO effectively captures critical frequency components, significantly improving the reconstruction of high-frequency image details that are crucial for super-resolution tasks. Gated Fusion Mechanism (GFM) adaptively complements WFNO's spectral features with spatial features from an Attention-based Neural Operator (AttnNO). This enhances the network's capability to capture both global structures and local details. Adaptive Time-Step (ATS) ODE solver, a deterministic sampling strategy, accelerates inference without sacrificing output quality by dynamically adjusting integration step sizes ATS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffFNO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, outperforming existing methods across various scaling factors by a margin of 2 to 4 dB in PSNR, including those beyond the training distribution. It also achieves this at lower inference time. Our approach sets a new standard in super-resolution, delivering both superior accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning, a new motion understanding task that requires generating visual answers (video segmentation masks) according to the input question, and hence needs implicit spatiotemporal reasoning and grounding. This task extends existing spatiotemporal grounding work focusing on explicit action/motion grounding, to a more general format by enabling implicit reasoning via questions. To facilitate the development of the new task, we collect a large-scale dataset called GROUNDMORE, which comprises 1,715 video clips, 249K object masks that are deliberately designed with 4 question types (Causal, Sequential, Counterfactual, and Descriptive) for benchmarking deep and comprehensive motion reasoning abilities. GROUNDMORE uniquely requires models to generate visual answers, providing a more concrete and visually interpretable response than plain texts. It evaluates models on both spatiotemporal grounding and reasoning, fostering to address complex challenges in motion-related video reasoning, temporal perception, and pixel-level understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a novel baseline model named Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning Assistant (MORA). MORA incorporates the multimodal reasoning ability from the Multimodal LLM, the pixel-level perception capability from the grounding model (SAM), and the temporal perception ability from a lightweight localization head. MORA achieves respectable performance on GROUNDMORE outperforming the best existing visual grounding baseline model by an average of 21.5% relatively. We hope this novel and challenging task will pave the way for future advancements in robust and general motion understanding via video reasoning segmentation</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenjun Zhang, Lijun Tang, Hongjin Wang, Lilian Zhang, Yunze He, Yaonan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision is increasingly used in areas such as unmanned vehicles, surveillance systems and remote sensing. However, in foggy scenarios, image degradation leads to loss of target details, which seriously affects the accuracy and effectiveness of these vision tasks. Polarized light, due to the fact that its electromagnetic waves vibrate in a specific direction, is able to resist scattering and refraction effects in complex media more effectively compared to unpolarized light. As a result, polarized light has a greater ability to maintain its polarization characteristics in complex transmission media and under long-distance imaging conditions. This property makes polarized imaging especially suitable for complex scenes such as outdoor and underwater, especially in foggy environments, where higher quality images can be obtained. Based on this advantage, we propose an innovative semi-physical polarization dehazing method that does not rely on an external light source. The method simulates the diffusion process of fog and designs a diffusion kernel that corresponds to the image blurriness caused by this diffusion. By employing spatiotemporal Fourier transforms and deconvolution operations, the method recovers the state of fog droplets prior to diffusion and the light inversion distribution of objects. This approach effectively achieves dehazing and detail enhancement of the scene.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaito Baba, Ryota Yagi, Junichiro Takahashi, Risa Kishikawa, Satoshi Kodera</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational models (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most crucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort required for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent efforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through techniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical foundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large amounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field. Moreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their practicality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and patients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces additional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{J}apanese \textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by \textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the first attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the medical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We successfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from X-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data. This model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed leading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets. Additionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact foundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a practical solution for environments where APIs and other external services cannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Avatar modelling has broad applications in human animation and virtual try-ons. Recent advancements in this field have focused on high-quality and comprehensive human reconstruction but often overlook the separation of clothing from the body. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces GGAvatar (Garment-separated 3D Gaussian Splatting Avatar), which relies on monocular videos.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Tam Nguyen, Zhao Ren, Trinh Pham, Phi Le Nguyen, Hongzhi Yin, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has transformed digital content creation and manipulation. Traditional visual editing tools require significant expertise, limiting accessibility. Recent strides in instruction-based editing have enabled intuitive interaction with visual content, using natural language as a bridge between user intent and complex editing operations. This survey provides an overview of these techniques, focusing on how LLMs and multimodal models empower users to achieve precise visual modifications without deep technical knowledge. By synthesizing over 100 publications, we explore methods from generative adversarial networks to diffusion models, examining multimodal integration for fine-grained content control. We discuss practical applications across domains such as fashion, 3D scene manipulation, and video synthesis, highlighting increased accessibility and alignment with human intuition. Our survey compares existing literature, emphasizing LLM-empowered editing, and identifies key challenges to stimulate further research. We aim to democratize powerful visual editing across various industries, from entertainment to education.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhang, Yihao Quan, Chaochen Gu, Chen Shen, Xiaosong Yuan, Shaotian Yan, Hao Cheng, Kaijie Wu, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The hallucination problem in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a common issue. Although image tokens occupy a majority of the input sequence of MLLMs, there is limited research to explore the relationship between image tokens and hallucinations. In this paper, we analyze the distribution of attention scores for image tokens across each layer and head of the model, revealing an intriguing and common phenomenon: most hallucinations are closely linked to the pattern of attention sinks in the self-attention matrix of image tokens, where shallow layers exhibit dense attention sinks and deeper layers show sparse attention sinks. We further analyze the attention heads of different layers and find that heads with high-density attention sink in the image part play a positive role in alleviating hallucinations. In this paper, we propose a training-free method named \textcolor{red}{\textbf{E}}nhancing \textcolor{red}{\textbf{A}}ttention \textcolor{red}{\textbf{H}}eads (EAH), an approach designed to enhance the convergence of image tokens attention sinks in the shallow layers. EAH identifies the attention head that shows the vision sink in a shallow layer and extracts its attention matrix. This attention map is then broadcast to other heads in the layer, thereby strengthening the layer to pay more attention to the image itself. With extensive experiments, EAH shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics, proving its effectiveness and generality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shota Yamazaki, Chenyu Zhang, Takuya Nanri, Akio Shigekane, Siyuan Wang, Jo Nishiyama, Tao Chu, Kohei Yokosawa</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end style autonomous driving models have been developed recently. These models lack interpretability of decision-making process from perception to control of the ego vehicle, resulting in anxiety for passengers. To alleviate it, it is effective to build a model which outputs captions describing future behaviors of the ego vehicle and their reason. However, the existing approaches generate reasoning text that inadequately reflects the future plans of the ego vehicle, because they train models to output captions using momentary control signals as inputs. In this study, we propose a reasoning model that takes future planning trajectories of the ego vehicle as inputs to solve this limitation with the dataset newly collected.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeonggeun Kim, Juntae Lee, Kyuhong Shim, Simyung Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) targets a critical real-world challenge, aiming to categorize inputs into known categories, termed closed-set classes, while identifying open-set inputs that fall outside these classes. Although transfer learning where a model is tuned to a given few-shot task has become a prominent paradigm in closed-world, we observe that it fails to expand to open-world. To unlock this challenge, we propose a two-stage method which consists of open-set aware meta-learning with open-set free transfer learning. In the open-set aware meta-learning stage, a model is trained to establish a metric space that serves as a beneficial starting point for the subsequent stage. During the open-set free transfer learning stage, the model is further adapted to a specific target task through transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to simulate open-set examples by modifying the training dataset or generating pseudo open-set examples. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmarks, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet, with only a 1.5\% increase in training effort. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in FSOSR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongfan Liu, Hyoukjun Kwon</p>
<p>Abstract: Stereo depth estimation is a fundamental component in augmented reality (AR) applications. Although AR applications require very low latency for their real-time applications, traditional depth estimation models often rely on time-consuming preprocessing steps such as rectification to achieve high accuracy. Also, non standard ML operator based algorithms such as cost volume also require significant latency, which is aggravated on compute resource-constrained mobile platforms. Therefore, we develop hardware-friendly alternatives to the costly cost volume and preprocessing and design two new models based on them, MultiHeadDepth and HomoDepth. Our approaches for cost volume is replacing it with a new group-pointwise convolution-based operator and approximation of consine similarity based on layernorm and dot product. For online stereo rectification (preprocessing), we introduce homograhy matrix prediction network with a rectification positional encoding (RPE), which delivers both low latency and robustness to unrectified images, which eliminates the needs for preprocessing. Our MultiHeadDepth, which includes optimized cost volume, provides 11.8-30.3% improvements in accuracy and 22.9-25.2% reduction in latency compared to a state-of-the-art depth estimation model for AR glasses from industry. Our HomoDepth, which includes optimized preprocessing (Homograhpy + RPE) upon MultiHeadDepth, can process unrectified images and reduce the end-to-end latency by 44.5%. We adopt a multi-task learning framework to handle misaligned stereo inputs on HomoDepth, which reduces theAbsRel error by 10.0-24.3%. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches in achieving both high model performance with low latency, which makes a step forward toward practical depth estimation on future AR devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Micro Crack detection using deep neural networks (DNNs) through an automated pipeline using wave fields interacting with the damaged areas is highly sought after. These high-dimensional spatio-temporal crack data are limited, and these datasets have large dimensions in the temporal domain. The dataset presents a substantial class imbalance, with crack pixels constituting an average of only 5% of the total pixels per sample. This extreme class imbalance poses a challenge for deep learning models with the different micro-scale cracks, as the network can be biased toward predicting the majority class, generally leading to poor detection accuracy. This study builds upon the previous benchmark SpAsE-Net, an asymmetric encoder-decoder network for micro-crack detection. The impact of various activation and loss functions were examined through feature space visualization using the manifold discovery and analysis (MDA) algorithm. The optimized architecture and training methodology achieved an accuracy of 86.85%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura O'Mahony, Nikola S. Nikolov, David JP O'Sullivan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent efforts to understand intermediate representations in deep neural networks have commonly attempted to label individual neurons and combinations of neurons that make up linear directions in the latent space by examining extremal neuron activations and the highest direction projections. In this paper, we show that this approach, although yielding a good approximation for many purposes, fails to capture valuable information about the behaviour of a representation. Neural network activations are generally dense, and so a more complex, but realistic scenario is that linear directions encode information at various levels of stimulation. We hypothesise that non-extremal level activations contain complex information worth investigating, such as statistical associations, and thus may be used to locate confounding human interpretable concepts. We explore the value of studying a range of neuron activations by taking the case of mid-level output neuron activations and demonstrate on a synthetic dataset how they can inform us about aspects of representations in the penultimate layer not evident through analysing maximal activations alone. We use our findings to develop a method to curate data from mid-range logit samples for retraining to mitigate spurious correlations, or confounding concepts in the penultimate layer, on real benchmark datasets. The success of our method exemplifies the utility of inspecting non-maximal activations to extract complex relationships learned by models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhao Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to detect and track all objects in a scene across frames, while maintaining a unique identity for each object. Most existing methods rely on the spatial motion features and appearance embedding features of the detected objects in consecutive frames. Effectively and robustly representing the spatial and appearance features of long trajectories has become a critical factor affecting the performance of MOT. We propose a novel approach for appearance and spatial feature representation, improving upon the clustering association method MOT\_FCG. For spatial motion features, we propose Diagonal Modulated GIoU, which more accurately represents the relationship between the position and shape of the objects. For appearance features, we utilize a dynamic appearance representation that incorporates confidence information, enabling the trajectory appearance features to be more robust and global. Based on the baseline model MOT\_FCG, we achieved 76.1 HOTA, 80.4 MOTA and 81.3 IDF1 on the MOT17 validation set, and also achieved competitive performance on the MOT20 and DanceTrack validation sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Zhou, Linye Lyu, Daojing He, Yu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial camouflage is a widely used physical attack against vehicle detectors for its superiority in multi-view attack performance. One promising approach involves using differentiable neural renderers to facilitate adversarial camouflage optimization through gradient back-propagation. However, existing methods often struggle to capture environmental characteristics during the rendering process or produce adversarial textures that can precisely map to the target vehicle. Moreover, these approaches neglect diverse weather conditions, reducing the efficacy of generated camouflage across varying weather scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and accurate camouflage generation method, namely RAUCA. The core of RAUCA is a novel neural rendering component, End-to-End Neural Renderer Plus (E2E-NRP), which can accurately optimize and project vehicle textures and render images with environmental characteristics such as lighting and weather. In addition, we integrate a multi-weather dataset for camouflage generation, leveraging the E2E-NRP to enhance the attack robustness. Experimental results on six popular object detectors show that RAUCA-final outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Zhong, Yinhao Xiao, Minghui Xu, Xiuzhen Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Short video platforms have become important channels for news dissemination, offering a highly engaging and immediate way for users to access current events and share information. However, these platforms have also emerged as significant conduits for the rapid spread of misinformation, as fake news and rumors can leverage the visual appeal and wide reach of short videos to circulate extensively among audiences. Existing fake news detection methods mainly rely on single-modal information, such as text or images, or apply only basic fusion techniques, limiting their ability to handle the complex, multi-layered information inherent in short videos. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel fake news detection method based on multimodal information, designed to identify misinformation through a multi-level analysis of video content. This approach effectively utilizes different modal representations to generate a unified textual description, which is then fed into a large language model for comprehensive evaluation. The proposed framework successfully integrates multimodal features within videos, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fake news detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and utilization of multimodal information, achieving an accuracy of 90.93%, which is significantly higher than the best baseline model (SV-FEND) at 81.05%. Furthermore, case studies provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of the approach in accurately distinguishing between fake news, debunking content, and real incidents, highlighting its reliability and robustness in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanhao Sun, RunZe Tian, Xiao Han, XinYao Liu, Yan Zhang, Kai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale Text-to-Image(T2I) models and implicit 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), many text-driven generative editing methods based on NeRF have appeared. However, the implicit encoding of geometric and textural information poses challenges in accurately locating and controlling objects during editing. Recently, significant advancements have been made in the editing methods of 3D Gaussian Splatting, a real-time rendering technology that relies on explicit representation. However, these methods still suffer from issues including inaccurate localization and limited manipulation over editing. To tackle these challenges, we propose GSEditPro, a novel 3D scene editing framework which allows users to perform various creative and precise editing using text prompts only. Leveraging the explicit nature of the 3D Gaussian distribution, we introduce an attention-based progressive localization module to add semantic labels to each Gaussian during rendering. This enables precise localization on editing areas by classifying Gaussians based on their relevance to the editing prompts derived from cross-attention layers of the T2I model. Furthermore, we present an innovative editing optimization method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, obtaining stable and refined editing results through the guidance of Score Distillation Sampling and pseudo ground truth. We prove the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan He, Guofen Wang, Weisheng Li, Yucheng Shu, Wenbo Li, Lijian Yang, Yuping Huang, Feiyan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate information from different modalities to obtain a comprehensive image, aiding downstream tasks. However, existing methods tend to prioritize natural image fusion and focus on information complementary and network training strategies. They ignore the essential distinction between natural and medical image fusion and the influence of underlying components. This paper dissects the significant differences between the two tasks regarding fusion goals, statistical properties, and data distribution. Based on this, we rethink the suitability of the normalization strategy and convolutional kernels for end-to-end MMIF.Specifically, this paper proposes a mixture of instance normalization and group normalization to preserve sample independence and reinforce intrinsic feature correlation.This strategy promotes the potential of enriching feature maps, thus boosting fusion performance. To this end, we further introduce the large kernel convolution, effectively expanding receptive fields and enhancing the preservation of image detail. Moreover, the proposed multipath adaptive fusion module recalibrates the decoder input with features of various scales and receptive fields, ensuring the transmission of crucial information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance in multiple fusion tasks and significantly improves downstream applications.

By incorporating content from different periods and genres, it addresses varying layout complexities and historical changes in document structure. The modular design allows domain-specific configurations. We evaluate object detection models on this dataset, examining the impact of input size and subset-based training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huali Xu, Yongxiang Liu, Li Liu, Shuaifeng Zhi, Shuzhou Sun, Tianpeng Liu, MingMing Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) methods, which develop source-domain training strategies to enhance model transferability, face challenges with large-scale pre-trained models (LMs) due to inaccessible source data and training strategies. Moreover, fine-tuning LMs for CDFSL demands substantial computational resources, limiting practicality. This paper addresses the source-free CDFSL (SF-CDFSL) problem, tackling few-shot learning (FSL) in the target domain using only pre-trained models and a few target samples without source data or strategies. To overcome the challenge of inaccessible source data, this paper introduces Step-wise Distribution Alignment Guided Style Prompt Tuning (StepSPT), which implicitly narrows domain gaps through prediction distribution optimization. StepSPT proposes a style prompt to align target samples with the desired distribution and adopts a dual-phase optimization process. In the external process, a step-wise distribution alignment strategy factorizes prediction distribution optimization into a multi-step alignment problem to tune the style prompt. In the internal process, the classifier is updated using standard cross-entropy loss. Evaluations on five datasets demonstrate that StepSPT outperforms existing prompt tuning-based methods and SOTAs. Ablation studies further verify its effectiveness. Code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/xuhuali-mxj/StepSPT}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rutger Hendrix, Federica Proietto Salanitri, Concetto Spampinato, Simone Palazzo, Ulas Bagci</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce FedEvPrompt, a federated learning approach that integrates principles of evidential deep learning, prompt tuning, and knowledge distillation for distributed skin lesion classification. FedEvPrompt leverages two sets of prompts: b-prompts (for low-level basic visual knowledge) and t-prompts (for task-specific knowledge) prepended to frozen pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models trained in an evidential learning framework to maximize class evidences. Crucially, knowledge sharing across federation clients is achieved only through knowledge distillation on attention maps generated by the local ViT models, ensuring enhanced privacy preservation compared to traditional parameter or synthetic image sharing methodologies. FedEvPrompt is optimized within a round-based learning paradigm, where each round involves training local models followed by attention maps sharing with all federation clients. Experimental validation conducted in a real distributed setting, on the ISIC2019 dataset, demonstrates the superior performance of FedEvPrompt against baseline federated learning algorithms and knowledge distillation methods, without sharing model parameters. In conclusion, FedEvPrompt offers a promising approach for federated learning, effectively addressing challenges such as data heterogeneity, imbalance, privacy preservation, and knowledge sharing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quentin Bateux, Jonathan Koss, Patrick W. Sweeney, Erika Edwards, Nelson Rios, Aaron M. Dollar</p>
<p>Abstract: The digitization of natural history collections over the past three decades has unlocked a treasure trove of specimen imagery and metadata. There is great interest in making this data more useful by further labeling it with additional trait data, and modern deep learning machine learning techniques utilizing convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and similar networks show particular promise to reduce the amount of required manual labeling by human experts, making the process much faster and less expensive. However, in most cases, the accuracy of these approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling, typically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and validate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by examining the confidence that the network has in the generated label as well as utilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen level. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can achieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the labels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher confidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the statistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to move these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to being an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of ways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000 herbarium specimens. The analysis of the results points at under-investigated correlations as well as general alignment with known trends. By sharing this new dataset alongside this work, we want to allow ecologists to gather insights for their own research questions, at their chosen point of accuracy/coverage trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwoong Yang, Haejun Chung, Ikbeom Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-view learning often faces challenges in effectively leveraging images captured from different angles and locations. This challenge is particularly pronounced when addressing inconsistencies and uncertainties between views. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Uncertainty-Weighted Mutual Distillation (MV-UWMD) method. Our method enhances prediction consistency by performing hierarchical mutual distillation across all possible view combinations, including single-view, partial multi-view, and full multi-view predictions. This introduces an uncertainty-based weighting mechanism through mutual distillation, allowing effective exploitation of unique information from each view while mitigating the impact of uncertain predictions. We extend a CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture to facilitate robust feature learning and integration across multiple view combinations. We conducted extensive experiments using a large, unstructured dataset captured from diverse, non-fixed viewpoints. The results demonstrate that MV-UWMD improves prediction accuracy and consistency compared to existing multi-view learning approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Depth cameras are an interesting modality for capturing vital signs such as respiratory rate. Plenty approaches exist to extract vital signs in a controlled setting, but in order to apply them more flexibly for example in multi-camera settings, a simulated environment is needed to generate enough data for training and testing of new algorithms. We show first results of a 3D-rendering simulation pipeline that focuses on different noise models in order to generate realistic, depth-camera based respiratory signals using both synthetic and real respiratory signals as a baseline. While most noise can be accurately modelled as Gaussian in this context, we can show that as soon as the available image resolution is too low, the differences between different noise models surface.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengke Zhang, Fagui Liu, Quan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without relying on a predefined set of categories. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) demonstrates outstanding zero-shot classification capabilities but struggles with the pixel-wise segmentation task as the captured inter-patch correlations correspond to no specific visual concepts. Despite previous CLIP-based works improving inter-patch correlations by self-self attention, they still face the inherent limitation that image patches tend to have high similarity to outlier ones. In this work, we introduce CorrCLIP, a training-free approach for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which reconstructs significantly coherent inter-patch correlations utilizing foundation models. Specifically, it employs the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, ensuring that patches interact only with semantically similar ones. Furthermore, CorrCLIP obtains an understanding of an image's semantic layout via self-supervised models to determine concrete similarity values between image patches, which addresses the similarity irregularity problem caused by the aforementioned restricted patch interaction regime. Finally, CorrCLIP reuses the region masks produced by SAM to update the segmentation map. As a training-free method, CorrCLIP achieves a notable improvement across eight challenging benchmarks regarding the averaged mean Intersection over Union, boosting it from 44.4% to 51.0%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Usman, Azka Rehman, Abdullah Shahid, Abd Ur Rehman, Sung-Min Gho, Aleum Lee, Tariq M. Khan, Imran Razzak</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for estimating brain age from structural MRI data, incorporating functional MRI data is challenging due to its complex structure and the noisy nature of functional connectivity measurements. To address this, we present the Multitask Adversarial Variational Autoencoder, a custom deep learning framework designed to improve brain age predictions through multimodal MRI data integration. This model separates latent variables into generic and unique codes, isolating shared and modality-specific features. By integrating multitask learning with sex classification as an additional task, the model captures sex-specific aging patterns. Evaluated on the OpenBHB dataset, a large multisite brain MRI collection, the model achieves a mean absolute error of 2.77 years, outperforming traditional methods. This success positions M-AVAE as a powerful tool for metaverse-based healthcare applications in brain age estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushen Zuo, Jun Xiao, Kin-Chung Chan, Rongkang Dong, Cuixin Yang, Zongqi He, Hao Xie, Kin-Man Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: The stylization of 3D scenes is an increasingly attractive topic in 3D vision. Although image style transfer has been extensively researched with promising results, directly applying 2D style transfer methods to 3D scenes often fails to preserve the structural and multi-view properties of 3D environments, resulting in unpleasant distortions in images from different viewpoints. To address these issues, we leverage the remarkable generative prior of diffusion-based models and propose a novel style transfer method, OSDiffST, based on a pre-trained one-step diffusion model (i.e., SD-Turbo) for rendering diverse styles in multi-view images of 3D scenes. To efficiently adapt the pre-trained model for multi-view style transfer on small datasets, we introduce a vision condition module to extract style information from the reference style image to serve as conditional input for the diffusion model and employ LoRA in diffusion model for adaptation. Additionally, we consider color distribution alignment and structural similarity between the stylized and content images using two specific loss functions. As a result, our method effectively preserves the structural information and multi-view consistency in stylized images without any 3D information. Experiments show that our method surpasses other promising style transfer methods in synthesizing various styles for multi-view images of 3D scenes. Stylized images from different viewpoints generated by our method achieve superior visual quality, with better structural integrity and less distortion.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobin Deng, Changyu Diao, Min Li, Ruohan Yu, Duanqing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in novel view synthesis, balancing advanced rendering quality with real-time performance. However, in trained scenes, a large number of Gaussians with low opacity significantly increase rendering costs. This issue arises due to flaws in the split and clone operations during the densification process, which lead to extensive Gaussian overlap and subsequent opacity reduction. To enhance the efficiency of Gaussian utilization, we improve the adaptive density control of 3DGS. First, we introduce a more efficient long-axis split operation to replace the original clone and split, which mitigates Gaussian overlap and improves densification efficiency.Second, we propose a simple adaptive pruning technique to reduce the number of low-opacity Gaussians. Finally, by dynamically lowering the splitting threshold and applying importance weighting, the efficiency of Gaussian utilization is further improved.We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our Efficient Density Control (EDC) can enhance both the rendering speed and quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Fu, Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Ye, Xingliang Lei, Zhisong Wang, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical images often exhibit distribution shifts due to variations in imaging protocols and scanners across different medical centers. Domain Generalization (DG) methods aim to train models on source domains that can generalize to unseen target domains. Recently, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalization capabilities due to its prompt-based design, and has gained significant attention in image segmentation tasks. Existing SAM-based approaches attempt to address the need for manual prompts by introducing prompt generators that automatically generate these prompts. However, we argue that auto-generated prompts may not be sufficiently accurate under distribution shifts, potentially leading to incorrect predictions that still require manual verification and correction by clinicians. To address this challenge, we propose a method for 2D medical image segmentation called Self-Correcting SAM (CoSAM). Our approach begins by generating coarse masks using SAM in a prompt-free manner, providing prior prompts for the subsequent stages, and eliminating the need for prompt generators. To automatically refine these coarse masks, we introduce a generalized error decoder that simulates the correction process typically performed by clinicians. Furthermore, we generate diverse prompts as feedback based on the corrected masks, which are used to iteratively refine the predictions within a self-correcting loop, enhancing the generalization performance of our model. Extensive experiments on two medical image segmentation benchmarks across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority of CoSAM over state-of-the-art SAM-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marvin Kahra, Michael Breu{\ss}, Andreas Kleefeld, Martin Welk</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical morphology is a part of image processing that uses a window that moves across the image to change certain pixels according to certain operations. The concepts of supremum and infimum play a crucial role here, but it proves challenging to define them generally for higher-dimensional data, such as colour representations. Numerous approaches have therefore been taken to solve this problem with certain compromises. In this paper we will analyse the construction of a new approach, which we have already presented experimentally in paper [Kahra, M., Breu{\ss}, M., Kleefeld, A., Welk, M., DGMM 2024, pp. 325-337]. This is based on a method by Burgeth and Kleefeld [Burgeth, B., Kleefeld, A., ISMM 2013, pp. 243-254], who regard the colours as symmetric $2\times2$ matrices and compare them by means of the Loewner order in a bi-cone through different suprema. However, we will replace the supremum with the LogExp approximation for the maximum instead. This allows us to transfer the associativity of the dilation from the one-dimensional case to the higher-dimensional case. In addition, we will investigate the minimality property and specify a relaxation to ensure that our approach is continuously dependent on the input data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Sergeev, Victor Minchenkov, Aleksei Soldatov, Vasiliy Kakurin, Yaroslav Mazikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Various technologies, including computer vision models, are employed for the automatic monitoring of manual assembly processes in production. These models detect and classify events such as the presence of components in an assembly area or the connection of components. A major challenge with detection and classification algorithms is their susceptibility to variations in environmental conditions and unpredictable behavior when processing objects that are not included in the training dataset. As it is impractical to add all possible subjects in the training sample, an alternative solution is necessary. This study proposes a model that simultaneously performs classification and anomaly detection, employing metric learning to generate vector representations of images in a multidimensional space, followed by classification using cross-entropy. For experimentation, a dataset of over 327,000 images was prepared. Experiments were conducted with various computer vision model architectures, and the outcomes of each approach were compared.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewen Chen, Juan Wang, Wen Wang, Sunhan Xu, Hang Xiong, Yun Zeng, Jian Guo, Shuxun Wang, Chunfeng Yuan, Bing Li, Weiming Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods achieve remarkable success in analyzing quality for overall image, but few works explore quality analysis for Regions of Interest (ROIs). The quality analysis of ROIs can provide fine-grained guidance for image quality improvement and is crucial for scenarios focusing on region-level quality. This paper proposes a novel network, SEAGULL, which can SEe and Assess ROIs quality with GUidance from a Large vision-Language model. SEAGULL incorporates a vision-language model (VLM), masks generated by Segment Anything Model (SAM) to specify ROIs, and a meticulously designed Mask-based Feature Extractor (MFE) to extract global and local tokens for specified ROIs, enabling accurate fine-grained IQA for ROIs. Moreover, this paper constructs two ROI-based IQA datasets, SEAGULL-100w and SEAGULL-3k, for training and evaluating ROI-based IQA. SEAGULL-100w comprises about 100w synthetic distortion images with 33 million ROIs for pre-training to improve the model's ability of regional quality perception, and SEAGULL-3k contains about 3k authentic distortion ROIs to enhance the model's ability to perceive real world distortions. After pre-training on SEAGULL-100w and fine-tuning on SEAGULL-3k, SEAGULL shows remarkable performance on fine-grained ROI quality assessment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Roheda</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, image synthesis has achieved remarkable advancements, enabling diverse applications in content creation, virtual reality, and beyond. We introduce a novel approach to image generation using Auto-Regressive (AR) modeling, which leverages a next-detail prediction strategy for enhanced fidelity and scalability. While AR models have achieved transformative success in language modeling, replicating this success in vision tasks has presented unique challenges due to the inherent spatial dependencies in images. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by iteratively adding finer details to an image compositionally, constructing it as a hierarchical combination of base and detail image factors. This strategy is shown to be more effective than the conventional next-token prediction and even surpasses the state-of-the-art next-scale prediction approaches. A key advantage of this method is its scalability to higher resolutions without requiring full model retraining, making it a versatile solution for high-resolution image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mizuki Miyamoto, Ryugo Morita, Jinjia Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generation and text-guided image manipulation have received considerable attention in the field of image generation tasks. However, the mainstream evaluation methods for these tasks have difficulty in evaluating whether all the information from the input text is accurately reflected in the generated images, and they mainly focus on evaluating the overall alignment between the input text and the generated images. This paper proposes new evaluation metrics that assess the alignment between input text and generated images for every individual object. Firstly, according to the input text, chatGPT is utilized to produce questions for the generated images. After that, we use Visual Question Answering(VQA) to measure the relevance of the generated images to the input text, which allows for a more detailed evaluation of the alignment compared to existing methods. In addition, we use Non-Reference Image Quality Assessment(NR-IQA) to evaluate not only the text-image alignment but also the quality of the generated images. Experimental results show that our proposed evaluation approach is the superior metric that can simultaneously assess finer text-image alignment and image quality while allowing for the adjustment of these ratios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Presta, Enzo Tartaglione, Attilio Fiandrotti, Marco Grangetto, Pamela Cosman</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned progressive image compression is gaining momentum as it allows improved image reconstruction as more bits are decoded at the receiver. We propose a progressive image compression method in which an image is first represented as a pair of base-quality and top-quality latent representations. Next, a residual latent representation is encoded as the element-wise difference between the top and base representations. Our scheme enables progressive image compression with element-wise granularity by introducing a masking system that ranks each element of the residual latent representation from most to least important, dividing it into complementary components, which can be transmitted separately to the decoder in order to obtain different reconstruction quality. The masking system does not add further parameters nor complexity. At the receiver, any elements of the top latent representation excluded from the transmitted components can be independently replaced with the mean predicted by the hyperprior architecture, ensuring reliable reconstructions at any intermediate quality level. We also introduced Rate Enhancement Modules (REMs), which refine the estimation of entropy parameters using already decoded components. We obtain results competitive with state-of-the-art competitors, while significantly reducing computational complexity, decoding time, and number of parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhong Guo, Jianfeng Zhang, Cheng Zou, Jun Li, Meng Wang, Ruxue Wen, Pingzhong Tang, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on, widely used in online shopping, aims to generate images of a naturally dressed person conditioned on certain garments, providing significant research and commercial potential. A key challenge of try-on is to generate realistic images of the model wearing the garments while preserving the details of the garments. Previous methods focus on masking certain parts of the original model's standing image, and then inpainting on masked areas to generate realistic images of the model wearing corresponding reference garments, which treat the try-on task as an inpainting task. However, such implements require the user to provide a complete, high-quality standing image, which is user-unfriendly in practical applications. In this paper, we propose Try-On-Adapter (TOA), an outpainting paradigm that differs from the existing inpainting paradigm. Our TOA can preserve the given face and garment, naturally imagine the rest parts of the image, and provide flexible control ability with various conditions, e.g., garment properties and human pose. In the experiments, TOA shows excellent performance on the virtual try-on task even given relatively low-quality face and garment images in qualitative comparisons. Additionally, TOA achieves the state-of-the-art performance of FID scores 5.56 and 7.23 for paired and unpaired on the VITON-HD dataset in quantitative comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhao Li, Taishi Ono, Takeshi Uemori, Sho Nitta, Hajime Mihara, Alexander Gatto, Hajime Nagahara, Yusuke Moriuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent inverse rendering methods have greatly improved shape, material, and illumination reconstruction by utilizing polarization cues. However, existing methods only support dielectrics, ignoring conductors that are found everywhere in life. Since conductors and dielectrics have different reflection properties, using previous conductor methods will lead to obvious errors. In addition, conductors are glossy, which may cause strong specular reflection and is hard to reconstruct. To solve the above issues, we propose NeISF++, an inverse rendering pipeline that supports conductors and dielectrics. The key ingredient for our proposal is a general pBRDF that describes both conductors and dielectrics. As for the strong specular reflection problem, we propose a novel geometry initialization method using DoLP images. This physical cue is invariant to intensities and thus robust to strong specular reflections. Experimental results on our synthetic and real datasets show that our method surpasses the existing polarized inverse rendering methods for geometry and material decomposition as well as downstream tasks like relighting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deepfake technology has rapidly advanced, posing significant threats to information integrity and societal trust. While significant progress has been made in detecting deepfakes, the simultaneous manipulation of audio and visual modalities, sometimes at small parts but still altering the meaning, presents a more challenging detection scenario. We present a novel audio-visual deepfake detection framework that leverages the inter-modality differences in machine perception of speech, based on the assumption that in real samples - in contrast to deepfakes - visual and audio signals coincide in terms of information. Our framework leverages features from deep networks that specialize in video and audio speech recognition to spot frame-level cross-modal incongruities, and in that way to temporally localize the deepfake forgery. To this end, DiMoDif employs a Transformer encoder-based architecture with a feature pyramid scheme and local attention, and optimizes the detection model through a composite loss function accounting for frame-level detections and fake intervals localization. DiMoDif outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Temporal Forgery Localization task by +47.88% AP@0.75 on AV-Deepfake1M, and performs on-par on LAV-DF. On the Deepfake Detection task, it outperforms the state-of-the-art by +30.5% AUC on AV-Deepfake1M, +2.8% AUC on FakeAVCeleb, and performs on-par on LAV-DF.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Alfarano, Alberto Alfarano, Linda Friso, Andrea Bacciu, Irene Amerini, Fabrizio Silvestri</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-Temporal predictive Learning is a self-supervised learning paradigm that enables models to identify spatial and temporal patterns by predicting future frames based on past frames. Traditional methods, which use recurrent neural networks to capture temporal patterns, have proven their effectiveness but come with high system complexity and computational demand. Convolutions could offer a more efficient alternative but are limited by their characteristic of treating all previous frames equally, resulting in poor temporal characterization, and by their local receptive field, limiting the capacity to capture distant correlations among frames. In this paper, we propose STLight, a novel method for spatio-temporal learning that relies solely on channel-wise and depth-wise convolutions as learnable layers. STLight overcomes the limitations of traditional convolutional approaches by rearranging spatial and temporal dimensions together, using a single convolution to mix both types of features into a comprehensive spatio-temporal patch representation. This representation is then processed in a purely convolutional framework, capable of focusing simultaneously on the interaction among near and distant patches, and subsequently allowing for efficient reconstruction of the predicted frames. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on STL benchmarks across different datasets and settings, while significantly improving computational efficiency in terms of parameters and computational FLOPs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kosuke Iwama, Ryugo Morita, Jinjia Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressive sensing (CS), acquiring and reconstructing signals below the Nyquist rate, has great potential in image and video acquisition to exploit data redundancy and greatly reduce the amount of sampled data. To further reduce the sampled data while keeping the video quality, this paper explores the temporal redundancy in video CS and proposes a block based adaptive compressive sensing framework with a sampling rate (SR) control strategy. To avoid redundant compression of non-moving regions, we first incorporate moving block detection between consecutive frames, and only transmit the measurements of moving blocks. The non-moving regions are reconstructed from the previous frame. In addition, we propose a block storage system and a dynamic threshold to achieve adaptive SR allocation to each frame based on the area of moving regions and target SR for controlling the average SR within the target SR. Finally, to reduce blocking artifacts and improve reconstruction quality, we adopt a cooperative reconstruction of the moving and non-moving blocks by referring to the measurements of the non-moving blocks from the previous frame. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that this work is able to control SR and obtain better performance than existing works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Ren, Yang Cong, Ronghan Chen, Jiahao Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning robust and generalizable manipulation skills from demonstrations remains a key challenge in robotics, with broad applications in industrial automation and service robotics. While recent imitation learning methods have achieved impressive results, they often require large amounts of demonstration data and struggle to generalize across different spatial variants. In this work, we present a novel framework that learns manipulation skills from as few as 10 demonstrations, yet still generalizes to spatial variants such as different initial object positions and camera viewpoints. Our framework consists of two key modules: Semantic Guided Perception (SGP), which constructs task-focused, spatially aware 3D point cloud representations from RGB-D inputs; and Spatial Generalized Decision (SGD), an efficient diffusion-based decision-making module that generates actions via denoising. To effectively learn generalization ability from limited data, we introduce a critical spatially equivariant training strategy that captures the spatial knowledge embedded in expert demonstrations. We validate our framework through extensive experiments on both simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic systems. Our method demonstrates a 60 percent improvement in success rates over state-of-the-art approaches on a series of challenging tasks, even with substantial variations in object poses and camera viewpoints. This work shows significant potential for advancing efficient, generalizable manipulation skill learning in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiology reports are crucial for planning treatment strategies and enhancing doctor-patient communication, yet manually writing these reports is burdensome for radiologists. While automatic report generation offers a solution, existing methods often rely on single-view radiographs, limiting diagnostic accuracy. To address this problem, we propose MCL, a Multi-view enhanced Contrastive Learning method for chest X-ray report generation. Specifically, we first introduce multi-view enhanced contrastive learning for visual representation by maximizing agreements between multi-view radiographs and their corresponding report. Subsequently, to fully exploit patient-specific indications (e.g., patient's symptoms) for report generation, we add a transitional ``bridge" for missing indications to reduce embedding space discrepancies caused by their presence or absence. Additionally, we construct Multi-view CXR and Two-view CXR datasets from public sources to support research on multi-view report generation. Our proposed MCL surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, achieving a 5.0% F1 RadGraph improvement on MIMIC-CXR, a 7.3% BLEU-1 improvement on MIMIC-ABN, a 3.1% BLEU-4 improvement on Multi-view CXR, and an 8.2% F1 CheXbert improvement on Two-view CXR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer-based Super-Resolution (SR) models have recently advanced image reconstruction quality, yet challenges remain due to computational complexity and an over-reliance on large patch sizes, which constrain fine-grained detail enhancement. In this work, we propose TaylorIR to address these limitations by utilizing a patch size of 1x1, enabling pixel-level processing in any transformer-based SR model. To address the significant computational demands under the traditional self-attention mechanism, we employ the TaylorShift attention mechanism, a memory-efficient alternative based on Taylor series expansion, achieving full token-to-token interactions with linear complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art SR performance while reducing memory consumption by up to 60% compared to traditional self-attention-based transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingxi Yin, Zhi Li, Jingfeng Zhang, Chenglin Li, Yin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, with their impressive generative capabilities, have been adopted for image editing tasks, demonstrating remarkable efficacy. However, due to attention leakage and collision between the cross-attention map of the object and the new color attribute from the text prompt, text-guided image editing methods may fail to change the color of an object, resulting in a misalignment between the resulting image and the text prompt. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the process of text-guided image synthesizing and what semantic information different cross-attention blocks have learned. We observe that the visual representation of an object is determined in the up-block of the diffusion model in the early stage of the denoising process, and color adjustment can be achieved through value matrices alignment in the cross-attention layer. Based on our findings, we propose a straightforward, yet stable, and effective image-guided method to modify the color of an object without requiring any additional fine-tuning or training. Lastly, we present a benchmark dataset called COLORBENCH, the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of color change methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in object-level color editing and surpass the performance of popular text-guided image editing approaches in both synthesized and real images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Wang, Xinlin Zhang, Yuanbin Chen, Yuanbo Zhou, Longxuan Zhao, Tao Tan, Tong Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: In clinical medicine, precise image segmentation can provide substantial support to clinicians. However, achieving such precision often requires a large amount of finely annotated data, which can be costly. Scribble annotation presents a more efficient alternative, boosting labeling efficiency. However, utilizing such minimal supervision for medical image segmentation training, especially with scribble annotations, poses significant challenges. To address these challenges, we introduce ScribbleVS, a novel framework that leverages scribble annotations. We introduce a Regional Pseudo Labels Diffusion Module to expand the scope of supervision and reduce the impact of noise present in pseudo labels. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Competitive Selection module for enhanced refinement in selecting pseudo labels. Experiments conducted on the ACDC and MSCMRseg datasets have demonstrated promising results, achieving performance levels that even exceed those of fully supervised methodologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingru Yang, Chengzhi Cao, Chentianye Xu, Zhongwei Xie, Kaixiang Huang, Yang Zhou, Shengfeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face inherent challenges in image matting, particularly in preserving fine structural details. ViTs, with their global receptive field enabled by the self-attention mechanism, often lose local details such as hair strands. Conversely, CNNs, constrained by their local receptive field, rely on deeper layers to approximate global context but struggle to retain fine structures at greater depths.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Morpho-Aware Global Attention (MAGA) mechanism, designed to effectively capture the morphology of fine structures. MAGA employs Tetris-like convolutional patterns to align the local shapes of fine structures, ensuring optimal local correspondence while maintaining sensitivity to morphological details. The extracted local morphology information is used as query embeddings, which are projected onto global key embeddings to emphasize local details in a broader context. Subsequently, by projecting onto value embeddings, MAGA seamlessly integrates these emphasized morphological details into a unified global structure.
  This approach enables MAGA to simultaneously focus on local morphology and unify these details into a coherent whole, effectively preserving fine structures. Extensive experiments show that our MAGA-based ViT achieves significant performance gains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across two benchmarks with average improvements of 4.3% in SAD and 39.5% in MSE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingru Yang, Huan Yu, Yang Jingxin, Chentianye Xu, Yin Biao, Yu Sun, Shengfeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at descriptive tasks within images but often struggle with precise object localization, a critical element for reliable visual interpretation. In contrast, traditional object detection models provide high localization accuracy but frequently generate detections lacking contextual coherence due to limited modeling of inter-object relationships. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Visual-Linguistic Agent (VLA), a collaborative framework that combines the relational reasoning strengths of MLLMs with the precise localization capabilities of traditional object detectors. In the VLA paradigm, the MLLM serves as a central Linguistic Agent, working collaboratively with specialized Vision Agents for object detection and classification. The Linguistic Agent evaluates and refines detections by reasoning over spatial and contextual relationships among objects, while the classification Vision Agent offers corrective feedback to improve classification accuracy. This collaborative approach enables VLA to significantly enhance both spatial reasoning and object localization, addressing key challenges in multimodal understanding. Extensive evaluations on the COCO dataset demonstrate substantial performance improvements across multiple detection models, highlighting VLA's potential to set a new benchmark in accurate and contextually coherent object detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Kaiser, Nikolas Adaloglou, Markus Kollmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Guidance is an error-correcting technique used to improve the perceptual quality of images generated by diffusion models. Typically, the correction is achieved by linear extrapolation, using an auxiliary diffusion model that has lower performance than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar errors as the primary one but stronger. We verify this finding in higher dimensions, where we show that competitive generative performance to state-of-the-art guidance methods can be achieved when the auxiliary model differs from the primary one only by having stronger weight regularization. As an independent contribution, we investigate whether upweighting long-range spatial dependencies improves visual fidelity. The result is a novel guidance method, which we call sliding window guidance (SWG), that guides the primary model with itself by constraining its receptive field. Intriguingly, SWG aligns better with human preferences than state-of-the-art guidance methods while requiring neither training, architectural modifications, nor class conditioning. The code will be released.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10261">Partial Scene Text Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Minghui Liao, Zhouyi Xie, Wenyu Liu, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of partial scene text retrieval involves localizing and searching for text instances that are the same or similar to a given query text from an image gallery. However, existing methods can only handle text-line instances, leaving the problem of searching for partial patches within these text-line instances unsolved due to a lack of patch annotations in the training data. To address this issue, we propose a network that can simultaneously retrieve both text-line instances and their partial patches. Our method embeds the two types of data (query text and scene text instances) into a shared feature space and measures their cross-modal similarities. To handle partial patches, our proposed approach adopts a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach to learn their similarities with query text, without requiring extra annotations. However, constructing bags, which is a standard step of conventional MIL approaches, can introduce numerous noisy samples for training, and lower inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a Ranking MIL (RankMIL) approach to adaptively filter those noisy samples. Additionally, we present a Dynamic Partial Match Algorithm (DPMA) that can directly search for the target partial patch from a text-line instance during the inference stage, without requiring bags. This greatly improves the search efficiency and the performance of retrieving partial patches. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lanfeng4659/PSTR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pathirage N. Deelaka, Tharindu Wickremasinghe, Devin Y. De Silva, Lisara N. Gajaweera</p>
<p>Abstract: Model interpretability is a key challenge that has yet to align with the advancements observed in contemporary state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, deep learning aided vision tasks require interpretability, in order for their adoption in more specialized domains such as medical imaging. Although the field of explainable AI (XAI) developed methods for interpreting vision models along with early convolutional neural networks, recent XAI research has mainly focused on assigning attributes via saliency maps. As such, these methods are restricted to providing explanations at a sample level, and many explainability methods suffer from low adaptability across a wide range of vision models. In our work, we re-think vision-model explainability from a novel perspective, to probe the general input structure that a model has learnt during its training. To this end, we ask the question: "How would a vision model fill-in a masked-image". Experiments on standard vision datasets and pre-trained models reveal consistent patterns, and could be intergrated as an additional model-agnostic explainability tool in modern machine-learning platforms.

<p>Abstract: We present a coarse-to-fine neural deformation model to simultaneously recover the camera pose and the 4D reconstruction of an unknown object from multiple RGB sequences in the wild. To that end, our approach does not consider any pre-built 3D template nor 3D training data as well as controlled illumination conditions, and can sort out the problem in a self-supervised manner. Our model exploits canonical and image-variant spaces where both coarse and fine components are considered. We introduce a neural local quadratic model with spatio-temporal consistency to encode fine details that is combined with canonical embeddings in order to establish correspondences across sequences. We thoroughly validate the method on challenging scenarios with complex and real-world deformations, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, an ablation study and a comparison with respect to competing approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Elsner, Paula Usinger, Julius Nehring-Wirxel, Gregor Kobsik, Victor Czech, Yanjiang He, Isaak Lim, Leif Kobbelt</p>
<p>Abstract: In language processing, transformers benefit greatly from text being condensed. This is achieved through a larger vocabulary that captures word fragments instead of plain characters. This is often done with Byte Pair Encoding. In the context of images, tokenisation of visual data is usually limited to regular grids obtained from quantisation methods, without global content awareness. Our work improves tokenisation of visual data by bringing Byte Pair Encoding from 1D to multiple dimensions, as a complementary add-on to existing compression. We achieve this through counting constellations of token pairs and replacing the most frequent token pair with a newly introduced token. The multidimensionality only increases the computation time by a factor of 2 for images, making it applicable even to large datasets like ImageNet within minutes on consumer hardware. This is a lossless preprocessing step. Our evaluation shows improved training and inference performance of transformers on visual data achieved by compressing frequent constellations of tokens: The resulting sequences are shorter, with more uniformly distributed information content, e.g. condensing empty regions in an image into single tokens. As our experiments show, these condensed sequences are easier to process. We additionally introduce a strategy to amplify this compression further by clustering the vocabulary.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryoma Yataka, Adriano Cardace, Pu Perry Wang, Petros Boufounos, Ryuhei Takahashi</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.77+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Collimator detection remains a challenging task in X-ray systems with unreliable or non-available information about the detectors position relative to the source. This paper presents a physically motivated image processing pipeline for simulating the characteristics of collimator shadows in X-ray images. By generating randomized labels for collimator shapes and locations, incorporating scattered radiation simulation, and including Poisson noise, the pipeline enables the expansion of limited datasets for training deep neural networks. We validate the proposed pipeline by a qualitative and quantitative comparison against real collimator shadows. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that utilizing simulated data within our deep learning framework not only serves as a suitable substitute for actual collimators but also enhances the generalization performance when applied to real-world data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current image stitching methods often produce noticeable seams in challenging scenarios such as uneven hue and large parallax. To tackle this problem, we propose the Reference-Driven Inpainting Stitcher (RDIStitcher), which reformulates the image fusion and rectangling as a reference-based inpainting model, incorporating a larger modification fusion area and stronger modification intensity than previous methods. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised model training method, which enables the implementation of RDIStitcher without requiring labeled data by fine-tuning a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model. Recognizing difficulties in assessing the quality of stitched images, we present the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)-based metrics, offering a new perspective on evaluating stitched image quality. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances content coherence and seamless transitions in the stitched images. Especially in the zero-shot experiments, our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Code: https://github.com/yayoyo66/RDIStitcher</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Immel, Richard Fehler, Frank Bieder, Jan-Hendrik Pauls, Christoph Stiller</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles require road information for their operation, usually in form of HD maps. Since offline maps eventually become outdated or may only be partially available, online HD map construction methods have been proposed to infer map information from live sensor data. A key issue remains how to exploit such partial or outdated map information as a prior. We introduce M3TR (Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map construction both with and without map priors. We address shortcomings in ground truth generation for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first realistic scenarios with semantically diverse map priors. Examining various query designs, we use an improved method for integrating prior map elements into a HD map construction model, increasing performance by +4.3 mAP. Finally, we show that training across all prior scenarios yields a single Generalist model, whose performance is on par with previous Expert models that can handle only one specific type of map prior. M3TR thus is the first model capable of leveraging variable map priors, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at https://github.com/immel-f/m3tr</p>

<p>Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence introduces severe spatial and geometric distortions, challenging traditional image restoration methods. We propose the Probabilistic Prior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic diffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to address this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made remarkable advancements in comprehending video content for QA dialogue. However, they struggle to extend this visual understanding to tasks requiring precise temporal localization, known as Video Temporal Grounding (VTG). To address this gap, we introduce Number-Prompt (NumPro), a novel method that empowers Vid-LLMs to bridge visual comprehension with temporal grounding by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame. Treating a video as a sequence of numbered frame images, NumPro transforms VTG into an intuitive process: flipping through manga panels in sequence. This allows Vid-LLMs to "read" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost. Furthermore, fine-tuning on a NumPro-enhanced dataset defines a new state-of-the-art for VTG, surpassing previous top-performing methods by up to 6.9\% in mIoU for moment retrieval and 8.5\% in mAP for highlight detection.

<p>Abstract: Radiologists and doctors make use of X-ray images of the non-dominant hands of children and infants to assess the possibility of genetic conditions and growth abnormalities. This is done by assessing the difference between the actual extent of growth found using the X-rays and the chronological age of the subject. The assessment was done conventionally using The Greulich Pyle (GP) or Tanner Whitehouse (TW) approach. These approaches require a high level of expertise and may often lead to observer bias. Hence, to automate the process of assessing the X-rays, and to increase its accuracy and efficiency, several machine learning models have been developed. These machine-learning models have several differences in their accuracy and efficiencies, leading to an unclear choice for the suitable model depending on their needs and available resources. Methods: In this study, we have analyzed the 3 most widely used models for the automation of bone age prediction, which are the Xception model, VGG model and CNN model. These models were trained on the preprocessed dataset and the accuracy was measured using the MAE in terms of months for each model. Using this, the comparison between the models was done. Results: The 3 models, Xception, VGG, and CNN models have been tested for accuracy and other relevant factors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Yin, Haotong Qin, Yulun Zhang, Wenbo Li, Yong Guo, Jianjun Zhu, Cheng Wang, Biao Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense prediction is a critical task in computer vision. However, previous methods often require extensive computational resources, which hinders their real-world application. In this paper, we propose BiDense, a generalized binary neural network (BNN) designed for efficient and accurate dense prediction tasks. BiDense incorporates two key techniques: the Distribution-adaptive Binarizer (DAB) and the Channel-adaptive Full-precision Bypass (CFB). The DAB adaptively calculates thresholds and scaling factors for binarization, effectively retaining more information within BNNs. Meanwhile, the CFB facilitates full-precision bypassing for binary convolutional layers undergoing various channel size transformations, which enhances the propagation of real-valued signals and minimizes information loss. By leveraging these techniques, BiDense preserves more real-valued information, enabling more accurate and detailed dense predictions in BNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves performance levels comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing memory usage and computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xumin Gao, Mark Stevens, Grzegorz Cielniak</p>
<p>Abstract: The current vision-based aphid counting methods in water traps suffer from undercounts caused by occlusions and low visibility arising from dense aggregation of insects and other objects. To address this problem, we propose a novel aphid counting method through interactive stirring actions. We use interactive stirring to alter the distribution of aphids in the yellow water trap and capture a sequence of images which are then used for aphid detection and counting through an optimized small object detection network based on Yolov5. We also propose a counting confidence evaluation system to evaluate the confidence of count-ing results. The final counting result is a weighted sum of the counting results from all sequence images based on the counting confidence. Experimental results show that our proposed aphid detection network significantly outperforms the original Yolov5, with improvements of 33.9% in AP@0.5 and 26.9% in AP@[0.5:0.95] on the aphid test set. In addition, the aphid counting test results using our proposed counting confidence evaluation system show significant improvements over the static counting method, closely aligning with manual counting results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangzong Chen, Mingui Sun, Zhi-Hong Mao, Kangni Liu, Wenyan Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of neural networks that have been widely used in the field of image-to-image translation. In this paper, we propose a streamlined image-to-image translation network with a simpler architecture compared to existing models. We investigate the relationship between GANs and autoencoders and provide an explanation for the efficacy of employing only the GAN component for tasks involving image translation. We show that adversarial for GAN models yields results comparable to those of existing methods without additional complex loss penalties. Subsequently, we elucidate the rationale behind this phenomenon. We also incorporate experimental results to demonstrate the validity of our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wei, Wencheng Han, Xingping Dong, Jianbing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent diffusion-based Single-image 3D portrait generation methods typically employ 2D diffusion models to provide multi-view knowledge, which is then distilled into 3D representations. However, these methods usually struggle to produce high-fidelity 3D models, frequently yielding excessively blurred textures. We attribute this issue to the insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency during the diffusion process, resulting in significant disparities between different views and ultimately leading to blurred 3D representations. In this paper, we address this issue by comprehensively exploiting multi-view priors in both the conditioning and diffusion procedures to produce consistent, detail-rich portraits. From the conditioning standpoint, we propose a Hybrid Priors Diffsion model, which explicitly and implicitly incorporates multi-view priors as conditions to enhance the status consistency of the generated multi-view portraits. From the diffusion perspective, considering the significant impact of the diffusion noise distribution on detailed texture generation, we propose a Multi-View Noise Resamplig Strategy integrated within the optimization process leveraging cross-view priors to enhance representation consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce 3D portraits with accurate geometry and rich details from a single image.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Klervi Le Gall, Lise Bellanger, David Laplaud</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of severe non-traumatic disability in young adults and its incidence is increasing worldwide. The variability of gait impairment in MS necessitates the development of a non-invasive, sensitive, and cost-effective tool for quantitative gait evaluation. The eGait movement sensor, designed to characterize human gait through unit quaternion time series (QTS) representing hip rotations, is a promising approach. However, the small sample sizes typical of clinical studies pose challenges for the stability of gait data analysis tools. To address these challenges, this article presents two key scientific contributions. First, a comprehensive framework is proposed for transforming QTS data into a form that preserves the essential geometric properties of gait while enabling the use of any tabular synthetic data generation method. Second, a synthetic data generation method is introduced, based on nearest neighbors weighting, which produces high-fidelity synthetic QTS data suitable for small datasets and private data environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method, is demonstrated through its application to MS gait data, showing very good fidelity and respect of the initial geometry of the data. Thanks to this work, we are able to produce synthetic data sets and work on the stability of clustering methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Internal crack detection has been a subject of focus in structural health monitoring. By focusing on crack detection in structural datasets, it is demonstrated that deep learning (DL) methods can effectively analyze seismic wave fields interacting with micro-scale cracks, which are beyond the resolution of conventional visual inspection. This work explores a novel application of DL-based key point detection technique, where cracks are localized by predicting the coordinates of four key points that define a bounding region of the crack. The study not only opens new research directions for non-visual applications but also effectively mitigates the impact of imbalanced data which poses a challenge for previous DL models, as it can be biased toward predicting the majority class (non-crack regions). Popular DL techniques, such as the Inception blocks, are used and investigated. The model shows an overall reduction in loss when applied to micro-scale crack detection and is reflected in the lower average deviation between the location of actual and predicted cracks, with an average Intersection over Union (IoU) being 0.511 for all micro cracks (greater than 0.00 micrometers) and 0.631 for larger micro cracks (greater than 4 micrometers).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Karmann, Onay Urfalioglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in interactive point prompt based Image Segmentation allows to significantly reduce the manual effort to obtain high quality semantic labels. State-of-the-art unsupervised methods use self-supervised pre-trained models to obtain pseudo-labels which are used in training a prompt-based segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and training-free approach based solely on the self-attention of Stable Diffusion. We interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which enables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the required number of iterations along the Markov-chain to reach a relative probability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a Markov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed Markov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values within semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple yet effective truncated nearest neighbor framework to obtain interactive point prompt based segmentation. Despite being training-free, we experimentally show that our approach yields excellent results in terms of Number of Clicks (NoC), even outperforming state-of-the-art training based unsupervised methods in most of the datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Llama Guard 3 Vision, a multimodal LLM-based safeguard for human-AI conversations that involves image understanding: it can be used to safeguard content for both multimodal LLM inputs (prompt classification) and outputs (response classification). Unlike the previous text-only Llama Guard versions (Inan et al., 2023; Llama Team, 2024b,a), it is specifically designed to support image reasoning use cases and is optimized to detect harmful multimodal (text and image) prompts and text responses to these prompts. Llama Guard 3 Vision is fine-tuned on Llama 3.2-Vision and demonstrates strong performance on the internal benchmarks using the MLCommons taxonomy. We also test its robustness against adversarial attacks. We believe that Llama Guard 3 Vision serves as a good starting point to build more capable and robust content moderation tools for human-AI conversation with multimodal capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sucheng Ren, Yaodong Yu, Nataniel Ruiz, Feng Wang, Alan Yuille, Cihang Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: There exists recent work in computer vision, named VAR, that proposes a new autoregressive paradigm for image generation. Diverging from the vanilla next-token prediction, VAR structurally reformulates the image generation into a coarse to fine next-scale prediction. In this paper, we show that this scale-wise autoregressive framework can be effectively decoupled into \textit{intra-scale modeling}, which captures local spatial dependencies within each scale, and \textit{inter-scale modeling}, which models cross-scale relationships progressively from coarse-to-fine scales. This decoupling structure allows to rebuild VAR in a more computationally efficient manner. Specifically, for intra-scale modeling -- crucial for generating high-fidelity images -- we retain the original bidirectional self-attention design to ensure comprehensive modeling; for inter-scale modeling, which semantically connects different scales but is computationally intensive, we apply linear-complexity mechanisms like Mamba to substantially reduce computational overhead. We term this new framework M-VAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in both image quality and generation speed. For example, our 1.5B model, with fewer parameters and faster inference speed, outperforms the largest VAR-d30-2B. Moreover, our largest model M-VAR-d32 impressively registers 1.78 FID on ImageNet 256$\times$256 and outperforms the prior-art autoregressive models LlamaGen/VAR by 0.4/0.19 and popular diffusion models LDM/DiT by 1.82/0.49, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guowei Xu, Peng Jin, Li Hao, Yibing Song, Lichao Sun, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly through inference-time scaling, as illustrated by models such as OpenAI's o1. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Hull, Chao Zhang, Zsolt Kira, Duen Horng Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiable rendering methods have emerged as a promising means for generating photo-realistic and physically plausible adversarial attacks by manipulating 3D objects and scenes that can deceive deep neural networks (DNNs). Recently, differentiable rendering capabilities have evolved significantly into a diverse landscape of libraries, such as Mitsuba, PyTorch3D, and methods like Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting for solving inverse rendering problems that share conceptually similar properties commonly used to attack DNNs, such as back-propagation and optimization. However, the adversarial machine learning research community has not yet fully explored or understood such capabilities for generating attacks. Some key reasons are that researchers often have different attack goals, such as misclassification or misdetection, and use different tasks to accomplish these goals by manipulating different representation in a scene, such as the mesh or texture of an object. This survey adopts a task-oriented unifying framework that systematically summarizes common tasks, such as manipulating textures, altering illumination, and modifying 3D meshes to exploit vulnerabilities in DNNs. Our framework enables easy comparison of existing works, reveals research gaps and spotlights exciting future research directions in this rapidly evolving field. Through focusing on how these tasks enable attacks on various DNNs such as image classification, facial recognition, object detection, optical flow and depth estimation, our survey helps researchers and practitioners better understand the vulnerabilities of computer vision systems against photorealistic adversarial attacks that could threaten real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cassidy Gibson, Daniel Olszewski, Natalie Grace Brigham, Anna Crowder, Kevin R. B. Butler, Patrick Traynor, Elissa M. Redmiles, Tadayoshi Kohno</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a source image of a clothed person (an image subject), AI-based nudification applications can produce nude (undressed) images of that person. Moreover, not only do such applications exist, but there is ample evidence of the use of such applications in the real world and without the consent of an image subject. Still, despite the growing awareness of the existence of such applications and their potential to violate the rights of image subjects and cause downstream harms, there has been no systematic study of the nudification application ecosystem across multiple applications. We conduct such a study here, focusing on 20 popular and easy-to-find nudification websites. We study the positioning of these web applications (e.g., finding that most sites explicitly target the nudification of women, not all people), the features that they advertise (e.g., ranging from undressing-in-place to the rendering of image subjects in sexual positions, as well as differing user-privacy options), and their underlying monetization infrastructure (e.g., credit cards and cryptocurrencies). We believe this work will empower future, data-informed conversations -- within the scientific, technical, and policy communities -- on how to better protect individuals' rights and minimize harm in the face of modern (and future) AI-based nudification applications. Content warning: This paper includes descriptions of web applications that can be used to create synthetic non-consensual explicit AI-created imagery (SNEACI). This paper also includes an artistic rendering of a user interface for such an application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marina A. Ayad, Ramin Nateghi, Abhishek Sharma, Lawrence Chillrud, Tilly Seesillapachai, Lee A. D. Cooper, Jeffery A. Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Inflammation of the umbilical cord can be seen as a result of ascending intrauterine infection or other inflammatory stimuli. Acute fetal inflammatory response (FIR) is characterized by infiltration of the umbilical cord by fetal neutrophils, and can be associated with neonatal sepsis or fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Recent advances in deep learning in digital pathology have demonstrated favorable performance across a wide range of clinical tasks, such as diagnosis and prognosis. In this study we classified FIR from whole slide images (WSI). We digitized 4100 histological slides of umbilical cord stained with hematoxylin and eosin(H&E) and extracted placental diagnoses from the electronic health record. We build models using attention-based whole slide learning models. We compared strategies between features extracted by a model (ConvNeXtXLarge) pretrained on non-medical images (ImageNet), and one pretrained using histopathology images (UNI). We trained multiple iterations of each model and combined them into an ensemble. The predictions from the ensemble of models trained using UNI achieved an overall balanced accuracy of 0.836 on the test dataset. In comparison, the ensembled predictions using ConvNeXtXLarge had a lower balanced accuracy of 0.7209. Heatmaps generated from top accuracy model appropriately highlighted arteritis in cases of FIR 2. In FIR 1, the highest performing model assigned high attention to areas of activated-appearing stroma in Wharton's Jelly. However, other high-performing models assigned attention to umbilical vessels. We developed models for diagnosis of FIR from placental histology images, helping reduce interobserver variability among pathologists. Future work may examine the utility of these models for identifying infants at risk of systemic inflammatory response or early onset neonatal sepsis.</p>

<p>Abstract: General movements (GMs) are spontaneous, coordinated body movements in infants that offer valuable insights into the developing nervous system. Assessed through the Prechtl GM Assessment (GMA), GMs are reliable predictors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, GMA requires specifically trained clinicians, who are limited in number. To scale up newborn screening, there is a need for an algorithm that can automatically classify GMs from infant video recordings. This data poses challenges, including variability in recording length, device type, and setting, with each video coarsely annotated for overall movement quality. In this work, we introduce a tool for extracting features from these recordings and explore various machine learning techniques for automated GM classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many state-of-the-art computer vision architectures leverage U-Net for its adaptability and efficient feature extraction. However, the multi-resolution convolutional design often leads to significant computational demands, limiting deployment on edge devices. We present a streamlined alternative: a 1D convolutional encoder that retains accuracy while enhancing its suitability for edge applications. Our novel encoder architecture achieves semantic segmentation through channel-wise 1D convolutions combined with pixel-unshuffle operations. By incorporating PixelShuffle, known for improving accuracy in super-resolution tasks while reducing computational load, OneNet captures spatial relationships without requiring 2D convolutions, reducing parameters by up to 47%. Additionally, we explore a fully 1D encoder-decoder that achieves a 71% reduction in size, albeit with some accuracy loss. We benchmark our approach against U-Net variants across diverse mask-generation tasks, demonstrating that it preserves accuracy effectively. Although focused on image segmentation, this architecture is adaptable to other convolutional applications. Code for the project is available at https://github.com/shbyun080/OneNet .</p>

<p>Abstract: Virtual reality (VR), while enhancing user experiences, introduces significant privacy risks. This paper reveals a novel vulnerability in VR systems that allows attackers to capture VR privacy through obstacles utilizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals without physical intrusion and virtual connection with the VR devices. We propose mmSpyVR, a novel attack on VR user's privacy via mmWave radar. The mmSpyVR framework encompasses two main parts: (i) A transfer learning-based feature extraction model to achieve VR feature extraction from mmWave signal. (ii) An attention-based VR privacy spying module to spy VR privacy information from the extracted feature. The mmSpyVR demonstrates the capability to extract critical VR privacy from the mmWave signals that have penetrated through obstacles. We evaluate mmSpyVR through IRB-approved user studies. Across 22 participants engaged in four experimental scenes utilizing VR devices from three different manufacturers, our system achieves an application recognition accuracy of 98.5\% and keystroke recognition accuracy of 92.6\%. This newly discovered vulnerability has implications across various domains, such as cybersecurity, privacy protection, and VR technology development. We also engage with VR manufacturer Meta to discuss and explore potential mitigation strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myunsoo Kim, Donghyeon Ki, Seong-Woong Shim, Byung-Jun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As a highly expressive generative model, diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional success across various domains, including image generation, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, as data distributions grow more complex, training these models to convergence becomes increasingly computationally intensive. While diffusion models are typically trained using uniform timestep sampling, our research shows that the variance in stochastic gradients varies significantly across timesteps, with high-variance timesteps becoming bottlenecks that hinder faster convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a non-uniform timestep sampling method that prioritizes these more critical timesteps. Our method tracks the impact of gradient updates on the objective for each timestep, adaptively selecting those most likely to minimize the objective effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only accelerates the training process, but also leads to improved performance at convergence. Furthermore, our method shows robust performance across various datasets, scheduling strategies, and diffusion architectures, outperforming previously proposed timestep sampling and weighting heuristics that lack this degree of robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rising prevalence of vision-threatening retinal diseases poses a significant burden on the global healthcare systems. Deep learning (DL) offers a promising solution for automatic disease screening but demands substantial data. Collecting and labeling large volumes of ophthalmic images across various modalities encounters several real-world challenges, especially for rare diseases. Here, we introduce EyeDiff, a text-to-image model designed to generate multimodal ophthalmic images from natural language prompts and evaluate its applicability in diagnosing common and rare diseases. EyeDiff is trained on eight large-scale datasets using the advanced latent diffusion model, covering 14 ophthalmic image modalities and over 80 ocular diseases, and is adapted to ten multi-country external datasets. The generated images accurately capture essential lesional characteristics, achieving high alignment with text prompts as evaluated by objective metrics and human experts. Furthermore, integrating generated images significantly enhances the accuracy of detecting minority classes and rare eye diseases, surpassing traditional oversampling methods in addressing data imbalance. EyeDiff effectively tackles the issue of data imbalance and insufficiency typically encountered in rare diseases and addresses the challenges of collecting large-scale annotated images, offering a transformative solution to enhance the development of expert-level diseases diagnosis models in ophthalmic field.</p>

To this end, we propose a half-body human animation method, dubbed EchoMimicV2, that leverages a novel Audio-Pose Dynamic Harmonization strategy, including Pose Sampling and Audio Diffusion, to enhance half-body details, facial and gestural expressiveness, and meanwhile reduce conditions redundancy. To compensate for the scarcity of half-body data, we utilize Head Partial Attention to seamlessly accommodate headshot data into our training framework, which can be omitted during inference, providing a free lunch for animation. Furthermore, we design the Phase-specific Denoising Loss to guide motion, detail, and low-level quality for animation in specific phases, respectively. Besides, we also present a novel benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of half-body human animation. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that EchoMimicV2 surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Gong, Chaoran Cui, Chunyun Zhang, Wenna Wang, Xiushan Nie, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to improve the global model generalization in unseen domains by addressing data heterogeneity under privacy-preserving constraints. A common strategy in existing FedDG studies involves sharing domain-specific knowledge among clients, such as spectrum information, class prototypes, and data styles. However, this knowledge is extracted directly from local client samples, and sharing such sensitive information poses a potential risk of data leakage, which might not fully meet the requirements of FedDG. In this paper, we introduce prompt learning to adapt pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in the FedDG scenario, and leverage locally learned prompts as a more secure bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer among clients. Specifically, we propose a novel FedDG framework through Prompt Learning and AggregatioN (PLAN), which comprises two training stages to collaboratively generate local prompts and global prompts at each federated round. First, each client performs both text and visual prompt learning using their own data, with local prompts indirectly synchronized by regarding the global prompts as a common reference. Second, all domain-specific local prompts are exchanged among clients and selectively aggregated into the global prompts using lightweight attention-based aggregators. The global prompts are finally applied to adapt VLMs to unseen target domains. As our PLAN framework requires training only a limited number of prompts and lightweight aggregators, it offers notable advantages in computational and communication efficiency for FedDG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization ability of PLAN across four benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Schneider, Robert Krug, Narunas Vaskevicius, Luigi Palmieri, Joschka Boedecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often require extensive amounts of data. As opposed to model-free RL, model-based RL (MBRL) offers a potential solution with efficient data utilization through planning. Additionally, RL lacks generalization capabilities for real-world tasks. Prior work has shown that incorporating pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) enhances sample efficiency and generalization. While PVRs have been extensively studied in the context of model-free RL, their potential in MBRL remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we benchmark a set of PVRs on challenging control tasks in a model-based RL setting. We investigate the data efficiency, generalization capabilities, and the impact of different properties of PVRs on the performance of model-based agents. Our results, perhaps surprisingly, reveal that for MBRL current PVRs are not more sample efficient than learning representations from scratch, and that they do not generalize better to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To explain this, we analyze the quality of the trained dynamics model. Furthermore, we show that data diversity and network architecture are the most important contributors to OOD generalization performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi Zhang, Michael Loecher, Cagan Alkan, Mahmut Yurt, Shreyas S. Vasanawala, Daniel B. Ennis</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) based reconstruction has been widely investigated and employed in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. ML-based reconstructions can deliver clinically acceptable image quality under substantially accelerated scans. ML-based reconstruction, however, also requires substantial data and computational time to train the neural network, which is often optimized for a fixed acceleration rate or image contrast. In practice, imaging parameters are often tuned to best suit the diagnosis, which may differ from the training data. This can result in degraded image quality, and multiple trained networks are needed to fulfill the clinical demands. In this study, we propose a foundation model that uses adaptive unrolling, channel-shifting, and Pattern and Contrast-Prompt-UNet (PCP-UNet) to tackle the problem. In particular, the undersampled data goes through a different number of unrolled iterations according to its acceleration rate. Channel-shifting improves reconstructed data quality. The PCP-UNet is equipped with an image contrast and sampling pattern prompt. In vivo CMR experiments were performed using mixed combinations of image contrasts, acceleration rates, and (under)sampling patterns. The proposed foundation model has significantly improved image quality for a wide range of CMR protocols and outperforms the conventional ML-based method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhan Fu, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Xirong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are known to hallucinate, which limits their practical applications. Recent works have attempted to apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the performance of MLLMs, but have shown inconsistent improvements in mitigating hallucinations. To address this issue more effectively, we introduce Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO) to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike previous approaches, our method tackles hallucinations from their diverse forms and causes. Specifically, we develop three types of preference pair data targeting the following causes of MLLM hallucinations: (1) insufficient visual capabilities, (2) long context generation, and (3) multimodal conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and highlighting the potential of our approach. Ablation studies and in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our method and suggest the potential for further improvements through scaling up.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyun Wang, Zhe Chen, Wenhai Wang, Yue Cao, Yangzhou Liu, Zhangwei Gao, Jinguo Zhu, Xizhou Zhu, Lewei Lu, Yu Qiao, Jifeng Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generally follow a training process involving pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. However, these models suffer from distribution shifts, which limit their multimodal reasoning, particularly in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) performance. To address this, we introduce a preference optimization (PO) process to enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, (1) on the data side, we design an automated preference data construction pipeline to create MMPR, a high-quality, large-scale multimodal reasoning preference dataset. and (2) on the model side, we explore integrating PO with MLLMs, developing a simple yet effective method, termed Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), which boosts multimodal CoT performance. Our approach demonstrates improved performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in multimodal reasoning tasks. Notably, our model, InternVL2-8B-MPO, achieves an accuracy of 67.0 on MathVista, outperforming InternVL2-8B by 8.7 points and achieving performance comparable to the 10x larger InternVL2-76B. We hope this study could inspire further advancements in MLLMs. Code, data, and model shall be publicly released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Matsoukas, Johan Fredin Haslum, Moein Sorkhei, Magnus S\"oderberg, Kevin Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have reigned for a decade as the de facto approach to automated medical image diagnosis, pushing the state-of-the-art in classification, detection and segmentation tasks. Over the last years, vision transformers (ViTs) have appeared as a competitive alternative to CNNs, yielding impressive levels of performance in the natural image domain, while possessing several interesting properties that could prove beneficial for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of transformer-based models for medical image classification. We conduct a series of experiments on several standard 2D medical image benchmark datasets and tasks. Our findings show that, while CNNs perform better if trained from scratch, off-the-shelf vision transformers can perform on par with CNNs when pretrained on ImageNet, both in a supervised and self-supervised setting, rendering them as a viable alternative to CNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Halil Ibrahim Aysel, Xiaohao Cai, Adam Pr\"ugel-Bennett</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision aiming to identify and classify individual pixels in an image, with numerous applications in for example autonomous driving and medical image analysis. However, semantic segmentation can be highly challenging particularly due to the need for large amounts of annotated data. Annotating images is a time-consuming and costly process, often requiring expert knowledge and significant effort; moreover, saving the annotated images could dramatically increase the storage space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation, requiring the rough information of individual semantic class proportions, shortened as semantic proportions, rather than the necessity of ground-truth segmentation maps. This greatly simplifies the data annotation process and thus will significantly reduce the annotation time, cost and storage space, opening up new possibilities for semantic segmentation tasks where obtaining the full ground-truth segmentation maps may not be feasible or practical. Our proposed method of utilising semantic proportions can (i) further be utilised as a booster in the presence of ground-truth segmentation maps to gain performance without extra data and model complexity, and (ii) also be seen as a parameter-free plug-and-play module, which can be attached to existing deep neural networks designed for semantic segmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the good performance of our method compared to benchmark methods that rely on ground-truth segmentation maps. Utilising semantic proportions suggested in this work offers a promising direction for future semantic segmentation research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Shou, Huan Liu, Xiangyong Cao, Deyu Meng, Bo Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational emotion recognition (CER) is an important research topic in human-computer interactions. {Although recent advancements in transformer-based cross-modal fusion methods have shown promise in CER tasks, they tend to overlook the crucial intra-modal and inter-modal emotional interaction or suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we introduce a novel and lightweight cross-modal feature fusion method called Low-Rank Matching Attention Method (LMAM). LMAM effectively captures contextual emotional semantic information in conversations while mitigating the quadratic complexity issue caused by the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, by setting a matching weight and calculating inter-modal features attention scores row by row, LMAM requires only one-third of the parameters of self-attention methods. We also employ the low-rank decomposition method on the weights to further reduce the number of parameters in LMAM. As a result, LMAM offers a lightweight model while avoiding overfitting problems caused by a large number of parameters. Moreover, LMAM is able to fully exploit the intra-modal emotional contextual information within each modality and integrates complementary emotional semantic information across modalities by computing and fusing similarities of intra-modal and inter-modal features simultaneously. Experimental results verify the superiority of LMAM compared with other popular cross-modal fusion methods on the premise of being more lightweight. Also, LMAM can be embedded into any existing state-of-the-art CER methods in a plug-and-play manner, and can be applied to other multi-modal recognition tasks, e.g., session recommendation and humour detection, demonstrating its remarkable generalization ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Long, George Killick, Lipeng Zhuang, Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa, Zaiqiao Meng, Richard Mccreadie</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art pre-trained image models predominantly adopt a two-stage approach: initial unsupervised pre-training on large-scale datasets followed by task-specific fine-tuning using Cross-Entropy loss~(CE). However, it has been demonstrated that CE can compromise model generalization and stability. While recent works employing contrastive learning address some of these limitations by enhancing the quality of embeddings and producing better decision boundaries, they often overlook the importance of hard negative mining and rely on resource intensive and slow training using large sample batches. To counter these issues, we introduce a novel approach named CLCE, which integrates Label-Aware Contrastive Learning with CE. Our approach not only maintains the strengths of both loss functions but also leverages hard negative mining in a synergistic way to enhance performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CLCE significantly outperforms CE in Top-1 accuracy across twelve benchmarks, achieving gains of up to 3.52% in few-shot learning scenarios and 3.41% in transfer learning settings with the BEiT-3 model. Importantly, our proposed CLCE approach effectively mitigates the dependency of contrastive learning on large batch sizes such as 4096 samples per batch, a limitation that has previously constrained the application of contrastive learning in budget-limited hardware environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing egocentric 3D hand pose estimation systems that can perform reliably in complex, real-world scenarios is crucial for downstream applications. Previous approaches using RGB or NIR imagery struggle in challenging conditions: RGB methods are susceptible to lighting variations and obstructions like handwear, while NIR techniques can be disrupted by sunlight or interference from other NIR-equipped devices. To address these limitations, we present ThermoHands, the first benchmark focused on thermal image-based egocentric 3D hand pose estimation, demonstrating the potential of thermal imaging to achieve robust performance under these conditions. The benchmark includes a multi-view and multi-spectral dataset collected from 28 subjects performing hand-object and hand-virtual interactions under diverse scenarios, accurately annotated with 3D hand poses through an automated process. We introduce a new baseline method, TherFormer, utilizing dual transformer modules for effective egocentric 3D hand pose estimation in thermal imagery. Our experimental results highlight TherFormer's leading performance and affirm thermal imaging's effectiveness in enabling robust 3D hand pose estimation in adverse conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfu Jiang, Xuan He, Huaye Zeng, Cong Wei, Max Ku, Qian Liu, Wenhu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great results in single-image vision language tasks. However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved. The existing LMMs like OpenFlamingo, Emu2, and Idefics gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from the web, which is neither efficient nor effective. In this paper, we aim to build strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources. Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K multi-image instruction data to train a family of Mantis models. The instruction tuning empowers Mantis with different multi-image skills like co-reference, comparison, reasoning, and temporal understanding. We evaluate Mantis on 8 multi-image benchmarks and 6 single-image benchmarks. Mantis-Idefics2 can achieve SoTA results on all the multi-image benchmarks and beat the strongest multi-image baseline, Idefics2-8B by an average of 13 absolute points. Notably, Idefics2-8B was pre-trained on 140M interleaved multi-image data, which is 200x larger than Mantis-Instruct. We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out benchmarks, which shows its generalization ability. We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis also maintains a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2. Our results show that multi-image abilities are not necessarily gained through massive pre-training, instead, they can be gained by low-cost instruction tuning. The training and evaluation of Mantis has paved the road for future work to improve LMMs' multi-image abilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiamei Xiong, Xuefeng Yan, Yongzhen Wang, Wei Zhao, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Mingqiang Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Haze severely degrades the visual quality of remote sensing images and hampers the performance of road extraction, vehicle detection, and traffic flow monitoring. The emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) exhibits the significant potential for dense haze removal with its strong generation ability. Since remote sensing images contain extensive small-scale texture structures, it is important to effectively restore image details from hazy images. However, current wisdom of DDPM fails to preserve image details and color fidelity well, limiting its dehazing capacity for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Fourier-aware diffusion model for remote sensing image dehazing, termed RSHazeDiff. From a new perspective, RSHazeDiff explores the conditional DDPM to improve image quality in dense hazy scenarios, and it makes three key contributions. First, RSHazeDiff refines the training phase of diffusion process by performing noise estimation and reconstruction constraints in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Thus, it remedies the unpleasing results caused by the simple noise estimation constraint in DDPM. Second, by taking the frequency information as important prior knowledge during iterative sampling steps, RSHazeDiff can preserve more texture details and color fidelity in dehazed images. Third, we design a global compensated learning module to utilize the Fourier transform to capture the global dependency features of input images, which can effectively mitigate the effects of boundary artifacts when processing fixed-size patches. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the favorable performance of RSHazeDiff over state-of-the-art methods.

<p>Abstract: Do we fully leverage the potential of visual encoder in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)? The recent outstanding performance of MLLMs in multimodal understanding has garnered broad attention from both academia and industry. In the current MLLM rat race, the focus seems to be predominantly on the linguistic side. We witness the rise of larger and higher-quality instruction datasets, as well as the involvement of larger-sized LLMs. Yet, scant attention has been directed towards the visual signals utilized by MLLMs, often assumed to be the final high-level features extracted by a frozen visual encoder. In this paper, we introduce the Dense Connector - a simple, effective, and plug-and-play vision-language connector that significantly enhances existing MLLMs by leveraging multi-layer visual features, with minimal additional computational overhead. Building on this, we also propose the Efficient Dense Connector, which achieves performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5 with only 25% of the visual tokens. Furthermore, our model, trained solely on images, showcases remarkable zero-shot capabilities in video understanding as well. Experimental results across various vision encoders, image resolutions, training dataset scales, varying sizes of LLMs (2.7B->70B), and diverse architectures of MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA-v1.5, LLaVA-NeXT and Mini-Gemini) validate the versatility and scalability of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 19 image and video benchmarks. We hope that this work will provide valuable experience and serve as a basic module for future MLLM development. Code is available at https://github.com/HJYao00/DenseConnector .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasi Zhang, Peiyu Yu, Yaxuan Zhu, Yingshan Chang, Feng Gao, Ying Nian Wu, Oscar Leong</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have attracted significant attention for their simplicity and superior performance in high-resolution image synthesis. By leveraging the instantaneous change-of-variables formula, one can directly compute image likelihoods from a learned flow, making them enticing candidates as priors for downstream tasks such as inverse problems. In particular, a natural approach would be to incorporate such image probabilities in a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation problem. A major obstacle, however, lies in the slow computation of the log-likelihood, as it requires backpropagating through an ODE solver, which can be prohibitively slow for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose an iterative algorithm to approximate the MAP estimator efficiently to solve a variety of linear inverse problems. Our algorithm is mathematically justified by the observation that the MAP objective can be approximated by a sum of $N$ ``local MAP'' objectives, where $N$ is the number of function evaluations. By leveraging Tweedie's formula, we show that we can perform gradient steps to sequentially optimize these objectives. We validate our approach for various linear inverse problems, such as super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and compressed sensing, and demonstrate that we can outperform other methods based on flow matching.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangeek Hyun, Jae-Pil Heo</p>
<p>Abstract: Most advances in 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D GANs) largely depend on ray casting-based volume rendering, which incurs demanding rendering costs. One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework, we observe that a na\"ive generator architecture suffers from training instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce a generator architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians. Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts, and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene. Experimental results demonstrate that ours achieves a significantly faster rendering speed (x100) compared to state-of-the-art 3D consistent GANs with comparable 3D generation capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rushikesh Zawar, Shaurya Dewan, Prakanshul Saxena, Yingshan Chang, Andrew Luo, Yonatan Bisk</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in generating naturalistic images from textual inputs, and demonstrate the capacity to learn and represent complex visual-semantic relationships. While these diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, the underlying mechanisms driving their performance are not yet fully accounted for, with many unanswered questions surrounding what they learn, how they represent visual-semantic relationships, and why they sometimes fail to generalize. Our work presents Diffusion Partial Information Decomposition (DiffusionPID), a novel technique that applies information-theoretic principles to decompose the input text prompt into its elementary components, enabling a detailed examination of how individual tokens and their interactions shape the generated image. We introduce a formal approach to analyze the uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy terms by applying PID to the denoising model at both the image and pixel level. This approach enables us to characterize how individual tokens and their interactions affect the model output. We first present a fine-grained analysis of characteristics utilized by the model to uniquely localize specific concepts, we then apply our approach in bias analysis and show it can recover gender and ethnicity biases. Finally, we use our method to visually characterize word ambiguity and similarity from the model's perspective and illustrate the efficacy of our method for prompt intervention. Our results show that PID is a potent tool for evaluating and diagnosing text-to-image diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is essential in industrial manufacturing, yet traditional methods often rely heavily on extensive normal datasets and task-specific models, limiting their scalability. Recent advancements in large-scale vision-language models have significantly enhanced zero- and few-shot anomaly detection. However, these approaches may not fully leverage hierarchical features, potentially overlooking nuanced details crucial for accurate detection. To address this, we introduce a novel window self-attention mechanism based on the CLIP model, augmented with learnable prompts to process multi-level features within a Soldier-Officer Window Self-Attention (SOWA) framework. Our method has been rigorously evaluated on five benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance by leading in 18 out of 20 metrics, setting a new standard against existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingxin Zhang, Jianhui Yu, Tengfei Xue, Chaoyi Zhang, Dongnan Liu, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Current models for point cloud recognition demonstrate promising performance on synthetic datasets. However, real-world point cloud data inevitably contains noise, impacting model robustness. While recent efforts focus on enhancing robustness through various strategies, there still remains a gap in comprehensive analyzes from the standpoint of network architecture design. Unlike traditional methods that rely on generic techniques, our approach optimizes model robustness to noise corruption through network architecture design. Inspired by the token-mixing technique applied in 2D images, we propose Set-Mixer, a noise-robust aggregation module which facilitates communication among all points to extract geometric shape information and mitigating the influence of individual noise points. A sorting strategy is designed to enable our module to be invariant to point permutation, which also tackles the unordered structure of point cloud and introduces consistent relative spatial information. Experiments conducted on ModelNet40-C indicate that Set-Mixer significantly enhances the model performance on noisy point clouds, underscoring its potential to advance real-world applicability in 3D recognition and perception tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolaos Giakoumoglou, Tania Stathaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. While contrastive learning has shown promise in self-supervised learning by creating discriminative representations, its application in knowledge distillation remains limited and focuses primarily on discrimination, neglecting the structural relationships captured by the teacher model. To address this limitation, we propose Discriminative and Consistent Distillation (DCD), which employs a contrastive loss along with a consistency regularization to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of teacher and student representations. Our method introduces learnable temperature and bias parameters that adapt during training to balance these complementary objectives, replacing the fixed hyperparameters commonly used in contrastive learning approaches. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC-2012, we demonstrate that DCD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the student model sometimes surpassing the teacher's accuracy. Furthermore, we show that DCD's learned representations exhibit superior cross-dataset generalization when transferred to Tiny ImageNet and STL-10.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Zhou, Zixuan Zeng, Andi Chen, Xiaofan Zhou, Haowei Ni, Shiyao Zhang, Panfeng Li, Liangxi Liu, Mengyao Zheng, Xupeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring the capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian-based methods in the context of 3D scene reconstruction, this study contrasts these modern approaches with traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. Utilizing datasets such as Replica and ScanNet, we assess performance based on tracking accuracy, mapping fidelity, and view synthesis. Findings reveal that NeRF excels in view synthesis, offering unique capabilities in generating new perspectives from existing data, albeit at slower processing speeds. Conversely, Gaussian-based methods provide rapid processing and significant expressiveness but lack comprehensive scene completion. Enhanced by global optimization and loop closure techniques, newer methods like NICE-SLAM and SplaTAM not only surpass older frameworks such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of robustness but also demonstrate superior performance in dynamic and complex environments. This comparative analysis bridges theoretical research with practical implications, shedding light on future developments in robust 3D scene reconstruction across various real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujia Wu, Yiming Shi, Jiwei Wei, Chengwei Sun, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation has gained significant attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity portraits of specific identities conditioned on user-defined prompts. Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address efficiency, identity fidelity, and the preservation of the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, an efficient method that leverages the diffusion model as a hypernetwork to predict personalized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By incorporating these LoRA weights into the off-the-shelf text-to-image model, DiffLoRA enables zero-shot personalization during inference, eliminating the need for post-processing optimization. Moreover, we introduce a novel identity-oriented LoRA weights construction pipeline to facilitate the training process of DiffLoRA. The dataset generated through this pipeline enables DiffLoRA to produce consistently high-quality LoRA weights. Notably, the distinctive properties of the diffusion model enhance the generation of superior weights by employing probabilistic modeling to capture intricate structural patterns and thoroughly explore the weight space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffLoRA outperforms existing personalization approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving both time efficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Li, Qin Zou, Chi Chen, Bo Du, Long Chen, Jian Zhou, Hongkai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D object detection in driving scenarios faces the challenge of complex road environments, which can lead to the loss or incompleteness of key features, thereby affecting perception performance. To address this issue, we propose an advanced detection framework called Co-Fix3D. Co-Fix3D integrates Local and Global Enhancement (LGE) modules to refine Bird's Eye View (BEV) features. The LGE module uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for pixel-level local optimization and incorporates an attention mechanism for global optimization. To handle varying detection difficulties, we adopt multi-head LGE modules, enabling each module to focus on targets with different levels of detection complexity, thus further enhancing overall perception capability. Experimental results show that on the nuScenes dataset's LiDAR benchmark, Co-Fix3D achieves 69.4\% mAP and 73.5\% NDS, while on the multimodal benchmark, it achieves 72.3\% mAP and 74.7\% NDS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Xia, Hongwei Lin, Wei Ye, Hai Wu, Yadan Luo, Cheng Wang, Chenglu Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR-based outdoor 3D object detection has received widespread attention. However, training 3D detectors from the LiDAR point cloud typically relies on expensive bounding box annotations. This paper presents SC3D, an innovative label-efficient method requiring only a single coarse click on the bird's eye view of the 3D point cloud for each frame. A key challenge here is the absence of complete geometric descriptions of the target objects from such simple click annotations. To address this issue, our proposed SC3D adopts a progressive pipeline. Initially, we design a mixed pseudo-label generation module that expands limited click annotations into a mixture of bounding box and semantic mask supervision. Next, we propose a mix-supervised teacher model, enabling the detector to learn mixed supervision information. Finally, we introduce a mixed-supervised student network that leverages the teacher model's generalization ability to learn unclicked instances.Experimental results on the widely used nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our SC3D with only coarse clicks, which requires only 0.2% annotation cost, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to weakly-supervised 3D detection methods.The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Wei, Stefan Leutenegger</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional volumetric fusion algorithms preserve the spatial structure of 3D scenes, which is beneficial for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Meden, Asma Brazi, Fabrice Mayran de Chamisso, Steve Bourgeois</p>
<p>Abstract: 6D pose estimation aims at determining the pose of the object that best explains the camera observation. The unique solution for a non-symmetrical object can turn into a multi-modal pose distribution for a symmetrical object or when occlusions of symmetry-breaking elements happen, depending on the viewpoint. Currently, 6D pose estimation methods are benchmarked on datasets that consider, for their ground truth annotations, visual ambiguities as only related to global object symmetries, whereas they should be defined per-image to account for the camera viewpoint. We thus first propose an automatic method to re-annotate those datasets with a 6D pose distribution specific to each image, taking into account the visibility of the object surface in the image to correctly determine the visual ambiguities. Second, given this improved ground truth, we re-evaluate the state-of-the-art single pose methods and show that this greatly modifies the ranking of these methods. Third, as some recent works focus on estimating the complete set of solutions, we derive a precision/recall formulation to evaluate them against our image-wise distribution ground truth, making it the first benchmark for pose distribution methods on real images. We will make our annotations for the T-LESS dataset and our code publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a fundamental and long-standing visual task. In this work, we present a novel method, dubbed HMAFlow, to improve optical flow estimation in challenging scenes, particularly those involving small objects. The proposed model mainly consists of two core components: a Hierarchical Motion Field Alignment (HMA) module and a Correlation Self-Attention (CSA) module. In addition, we rebuild 4D cost volumes by employing a Multi-Scale Correlation Search (MCS) layer and replacing average pooling in common cost volumes with a search strategy utilizing multiple search ranges. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the best generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, compared with RAFT, our method achieves relative error reductions of 14.2% and 3.4% on the clean pass and final pass of the Sintel online benchmark, respectively. On the KITTI test benchmark, HMAFlow surpasses RAFT and GMA in the Fl-all metric by relative margins of 6.8% and 7.7%, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has significantly improved the generation of images from textual descriptions. However, existing evaluation metrics do not adequately assess the models' ability to handle a diverse range of textual prompts, which is crucial for their generalizability. To address this, we introduce a new metric called Visual Language Evaluation Understudy (VLEU). VLEU uses large language models to sample from the visual text domain, the set of all possible input texts for T2I models, to generate a wide variety of prompts. The images generated from these prompts are evaluated based on their alignment with the input text using the CLIP model.VLEU quantifies a model's generalizability by computing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the marginal distribution of the visual text and the conditional distribution of the images generated by the model. This metric provides a quantitative way to compare different T2I models and track improvements during model finetuning. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VLEU in evaluating the generalization capability of various T2I models, positioning it as an essential metric for future research in text-to-image synthesis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Xun, Siyuan Liang, Xiaojun Jia, Xinwei Liu, Xiaochun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained large models for multimodal contrastive learning, such as CLIP, have been widely recognized in the industry as highly susceptible to data-poisoned backdoor attacks. This poses significant risks to downstream model training. In response to such potential threats, finetuning offers a simpler and more efficient defense choice compared to retraining large models with augmented data. In the supervised learning domain, fine-tuning defense strategies can achieve excellent defense performance. However, in the unsupervised and semi-supervised domain, we find that when CLIP faces some complex attack techniques, the existing fine-tuning defense strategy, CleanCLIP, has some limitations on defense performance. The synonym substitution of its text-augmentation is insufficient to enhance the text feature space. To compensate for this weakness, we improve it by proposing a fine-grained \textbf{T}ext \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{C}leaner (TA-Cleaner) to cut off feature connections of backdoor triggers. We randomly select a few samples for positive and negative subtext generation at each epoch of CleanCLIP, and align the subtexts to the images to strengthen the text self-supervision. We evaluate the effectiveness of our TA-Cleaner against six attack algorithms and conduct comprehensive zero-shot classification tests on ImageNet1K. Our experimental results demonstrate that TA-Cleaner achieves state-of-the-art defensiveness among finetuning-based defense techniques. Even when faced with the novel attack technique BadCLIP, our TA-Cleaner outperforms CleanCLIP by reducing the ASR of Top-1 and Top-10 by 52.02\% and 63.88\%, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing demand for transparent and reliable models, particularly in high-stakes decision-making areas such as medical image analysis, has led to the emergence of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Post-hoc XAI techniques, which aim to explain black-box models after training, have raised concerns about their fidelity to model predictions. In contrast, Self-eXplainable AI (S-XAI) offers a compelling alternative by incorporating explainability directly into the training process of deep learning models. This approach allows models to generate inherent explanations that are closely aligned with their internal decision-making processes, enhancing transparency and supporting the trustworthiness, robustness, and accountability of AI systems in real-world medical applications. To facilitate the development of S-XAI methods for medical image analysis, this survey presents a comprehensive review across various image modalities and clinical applications. It covers more than 200 papers from three key perspectives: 1) input explainability through the integration of explainable feature engineering and knowledge graph, 2) model explainability via attention-based learning, concept-based learning, and prototype-based learning, and 3) output explainability by providing textual and counterfactual explanations. This paper also outlines desired characteristics of explainability and evaluation methods for assessing explanation quality, while discussing major challenges and future research directions in developing S-XAI for medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeliang Zhang, Phu Pham, Wentian Zhao, Kun Wan, Yu-Jhe Li, Jianing Zhou, Daniel Miranda, Ajinkya Kale, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: By treating visual tokens from visual encoders as text tokens, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse visual understanding tasks, leveraging the robust architectures of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as token counts grow, the quadratic scaling of computation in LLMs introduces a significant efficiency bottleneck, impeding further scalability. Although recent approaches have explored pruning visual tokens or employing lighter LLM architectures, the computational overhead from an increasing number of visual tokens remains a substantial challenge.
  In this study, we investigate the redundancy in visual computation at both the parameter and computational pattern levels within LLaVA, a representative MLLM, and introduce a suite of streamlined strategies to enhance efficiency. These include neighbor-aware visual token attention, pruning of inactive visual attention heads, and selective layer dropping for visual computations. By implementing these strategies in LLaVA, we achieve a reduction in computational demands of 88% while maintaining model performance across key benchmarks. Additionally, we validate the existence of visual computational redundancy in other MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B and InternVL-2.0-4B/8B/26B. These results present a novel pathway for MLLMs to handle dense visual tokens with minimal computational costs. Code and model checkpoints will be released to support further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyuan Wang, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for efficient multi-modal inference. Conventional quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quantization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency. On the contrary, we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal quantization strategy searching with low search cost. Specifically, we observe the strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency concerning output discretization errors. Therefore, we employ the entropy as the proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs between discretization errors and the search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quantization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks.

Methods: VideoSAM combines U-Net CNN and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for advanced feature extraction and segmentation across diverse HSV PD modalities, spanning fluids like water, FC-72, nitrogen, and argon under varied heat flux conditions. The framework also incorporates uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess pixel-based discretization errors, delivering reliable metrics such as contact line density and dry area fraction under experimental conditions. Results: VideoSAM outperforms SAM and modality-specific CNN models in segmentation accuracy, excelling in environments with complex phase boundaries, overlapping bubbles, and dynamic liquid-vapor interactions. Its hybrid architecture supports cross-dataset generalization, adapting effectively to varying modalities. The UQ module provides accurate error estimates, enhancing the reliability of segmentation outputs for advanced HSV PD research. Conclusion: MSEG-VCUQ, via VideoSAM, offers a robust solution for HSV PD segmentation, addressing previous limitations with advanced deep learning and UQ techniques. The open-source datasets and tools introduced enable scalable, precise, and adaptable segmentation for multimodal PD datasets, supporting advancements in HSV analysis and autonomous experimentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Cheng, Ruiqi Lei, Di Huang, Zhichao Liao, Fengyuan Piao, Yan Chen, Pingfa Feng, Long Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Parametric point clouds are sampled from CAD shapes, and have become increasingly prevalent in industrial manufacturing. However, most existing point cloud learning methods focus on the geometric features, such as developing efficient convolution operations, overlooking the important attribute of constraints inherent in CAD shapes, which limits these methods' ability to comprehend CAD shapes fully. To address this issue, we analyzed the effect of constraints, and proposed its deep learning-friendly representation, after that, the Constraint Feature Learning Network (CstNet) was developed to extract and leverage constraints. Our CstNet includes two stages. Stage 1 extracts constraints from B-Rep data or point cloud. Stage 2 leverages coordinates and constraints to enhance the comprehension of CAD shapes. Additionally, we built up the Parametric 20,000 Multi-modal Dataset for the scarcity of labeled B-Rep datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our CstNet achieved state-of-the-art performance on both public and proposed CAD shape datasets. To the best of our knowledge, CstNet is the first constraint-based learning method tailored for CAD shape analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhyeok Jang, Seojin Kim, Jinwoo Shin, Jongheon Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable advances in deep learning have led to the emergence of many off-the-shelf classifiers, e.g., large pre-trained models. However, since they are typically trained on clean data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Despite this vulnerability, their superior performance and transferability make off-the-shelf classifiers still valuable in practice, demanding further work to provide adversarial robustness for them in a post-hoc manner. A recently proposed method, denoised smoothing, leverages a denoiser model in front of the classifier to obtain provable robustness without additional training. However, the denoiser often creates hallucination, i.e., images that have lost the semantics of their originally assigned class, leading to a drop in robustness. Furthermore, its noise-and-denoise procedure introduces a significant distribution shift from the original distribution, causing the denoised smoothing framework to achieve sub-optimal robustness. In this paper, we introduce Fine-Tuning with Confidence-Aware Denoised Image Selection (FT-CADIS), a novel fine-tuning scheme to enhance the certified robustness of off-the-shelf classifiers. FT-CADIS is inspired by the observation that the confidence of off-the-shelf classifiers can effectively identify hallucinated images during denoised smoothing. Based on this, we develop a confidence-aware training objective to handle such hallucinated images and improve the stability of fine-tuning from denoised images. In this way, the classifier can be fine-tuned using only images that are beneficial for adversarial robustness. We also find that such a fine-tuning can be done by updating a small fraction of parameters of the classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FT-CADIS has established the state-of-the-art certified robustness among denoised smoothing methods across all $\ell_2$-adversary radius in various benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengbo Yuan, Geng Chen, Li Yi, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Egocentric Hand Object Interaction (HOI) videos provide valuable insights into human interactions with the physical world, attracting growing interest from the computer vision and robotics communities. A key task in fully understanding the geometry and dynamics of HOI scenes is dense pointclouds sequence reconstruction. However, the inherent motion of both hands and the camera makes this challenging. Current methods often rely on time-consuming test-time optimization, making them impractical for reconstructing internet-scale videos. To address this, we introduce UniHOI, a model that unifies the estimation of all variables necessary for dense 4D reconstruction, including camera intrinsic, camera poses, and video depth, for egocentric HOI scene in a fast feed-forward manner. We end-to-end optimize all these variables to improve their consistency in 3D space. Furthermore, our model could be trained solely on large-scale monocular video dataset, overcoming the limitation of scarce labeled HOI data. We evaluate UniHOI with both in-domain and zero-shot generalization setting, surpassing all baselines in pointclouds sequence reconstruction and long-term 3D scene flow recovery. UniHOI is the first approach to offer fast, dense, and generalizable monocular egocentric HOI scene reconstruction in the presence of motion. Code and trained model will be released in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately tracking neuronal activity in behaving animals presents significant challenges due to complex motions and background noise. The lack of annotated datasets limits the evaluation and improvement of such tracking algorithms. To address this, we developed SINETRA, a versatile simulator that generates synthetic tracking data for particles on a deformable background, closely mimicking live animal recordings. This simulator produces annotated 2D and 3D videos that reflect the intricate movements seen in behaving animals like Hydra Vulgaris. We evaluated four state-of-the-art tracking algorithms highlighting the current limitations of these methods in challenging scenarios and paving the way for improved cell tracking techniques in dynamic biological systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Bellavia, Zhenjun Zhao, Luca Morelli, Fabio Remondino</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a modular, non-deep learning method for filtering and refining sparse correspondences in image matching. Assuming that motion flow within the scene can be approximated by local homography transformations, matches are aggregated into overlapping clusters corresponding to virtual planes using an iterative RANSAC-based approach, with non-conforming correspondences discarded. Moreover, the underlying planar structural design provides an explicit map between local patches associated with the matches, enabling optional refinement of keypoint positions through cross-correlation template matching after patch reprojection. Finally, to enhance robustness and fault-tolerance against violations of the piece-wise planar approximation assumption, a further strategy is designed for minimizing relative patch distortion in the plane reprojection by introducing an intermediate homography that projects both patches into a common plane. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on standard datasets and image matching pipelines, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Unlike other current comparisons, the proposed benchmark also takes into account the more general, real, and practical cases where camera intrinsics are unavailable. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed non-deep learning, geometry-based approach achieves performances that are either superior to or on par with recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Finally, this study suggests that there are still development potential in actual image matching solutions in the considered research direction, which could be in the future incorporated in novel deep image matching architectures.</p>

Makowski, Lisa C. Adams, Keno K. Bressem</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a deep learning model for multi-organ segmentation of MRI scans.
  Materials and Methods: The model was trained on 1,200 manually annotated 3D axial MRI scans from the UK Biobank, 221 in-house MRI scans, and 1228 CT scans from the TotalSegmentator dataset. A human-in-the-loop annotation workflow was employed, leveraging cross-modality transfer learning from an existing CT segmentation model to segment 40 anatomical structures. The annotation process began with a model based on transfer learning between CT and MR, which was iteratively refined based on manual corrections to predicted segmentations. The model's performance was evaluated on MRI examinations obtained from the German National Cohort (NAKO) study (n=900) from the AMOS22 dataset (n=60) and from the TotalSegmentator-MRI test data (n=29). The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) were used to assess segmentation quality, stratified by organ and scan type. The model and its weights will be open-sourced.
  Results: MRSegmentator demonstrated high accuracy for well-defined organs (lungs: DSC 0.96, heart: DSC 0.94) and organs with anatomic variability (liver: DSC 0.96, kidneys: DSC 0.95). Smaller structures showed lower accuracy (portal/splenic veins: DSC 0.64, adrenal glands: DSC 0.69). On external validation using NAKO data, mean DSC ranged from 0.85 $\pm$ 0.08 for T2-HASTE to 0.91 $\pm$ 0.05 for in-phase sequences. The model generalized well to CT, achieving mean DSC of 0.84 $\pm$ 0.11 on AMOS CT data.
  Conclusion: MRSegmentator accurately segments 40 anatomical structures in MRI across diverse datasets and imaging protocols, with additional generalizability to CT images. This open-source model will provide a valuable tool for automated multi-organ segmentation in medical imaging research. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/hhaentze/MRSegmentator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer F. Atli, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Arda C. Demirtas, Mahmut Yurt, Onat Dalmaz, Tolga \c{C}ukur</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models comprising transformer components have pushed the performance envelope in medical image synthesis tasks. Contrary to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that use static, local filters, transformers use self-attention mechanisms to permit adaptive, non-local filtering to sensitively capture long-range context. However, this sensitivity comes at the expense of substantial model complexity, which can compromise learning efficacy particularly on relatively modest-sized imaging datasets. Here, we propose a novel adversarial model for multi-modal medical image synthesis, I2I-Mamba, that leverages selective state space modeling (SSM) to efficiently capture long-range context while maintaining local precision. To do this, I2I-Mamba injects channel-mixed Mamba (cmMamba) blocks in the bottleneck of a convolutional backbone. In cmMamba blocks, SSM layers are used to learn context across the spatial dimension and channel-mixing layers are used to learn context across the channel dimension of feature maps. Comprehensive demonstrations are reported for imputing missing images in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT protocols. Our results indicate that I2I-Mamba offers superior performance against state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based methods in synthesizing target-modality images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shen Yuan, Haotian Liu, Hongteng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: While following different technical routes, both low-rank and orthogonal adaptation techniques can efficiently adapt large-scale pre-training models in specific tasks or domains based on a small piece of trainable parameters. In this study, we bridge the gap between these two techniques, proposing a simple but effective adaptation method based on Householder reflections. Given a pre-trained model, our method fine-tunes its layers by multiplying each frozen weight matrix with an orthogonal matrix constructed by a chain of learnable Householder reflections (HRs). This HR-based orthogonal fine-tuning is equivalent to an adaptive low-rank adaptation. Moreover, we show that the orthogonality of the reflection planes corresponding to the HRs impacts the model capacity and regularity. The analysis motivates us to regularize the orthogonality of the HRs, leading to different implementations of the proposed Householder reflection adaptation (HRA) method. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, HRA achieves superior performance with fewer learnable parameters when adapting large language models and conditional image generators.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyi Lin, Pengju Lyu, Jie Zhang, Yuqing Wang, Cheng Wang, Jianjun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-contrast CT (NCCT) imaging may reduce image contrast and anatomical visibility, potentially increasing diagnostic uncertainty. In contrast, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) facilitates the observation of regions of interest (ROI). Leading generative models, especially the conditional diffusion model, demonstrate remarkable capabilities in medical image modality transformation. Typical conditional diffusion models commonly generate images with guidance of segmentation labels for medical modal transformation. Limited access to authentic guidance and its low cardinality can pose challenges to the practical clinical application of conditional diffusion models. To achieve an equilibrium of generative quality and clinical practices, we propose a novel Syncretic generative model based on the latent diffusion model for medical image translation (S$^2$LDM), which can realize high-fidelity reconstruction without demand of additional condition during inference. S$^2$LDM enhances the similarity in distinct modal images via syncretic encoding and diffusing, promoting amalgamated information in the latent space and generating medical images with more details in contrast-enhanced regions. However, syncretic latent spaces in the frequency domain tend to favor lower frequencies, commonly locate in identical anatomic structures. Thus, S$^2$LDM applies adaptive similarity loss and dynamic similarity to guide the generation and supplements the shortfall in high-frequency details throughout the training process. Quantitative experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach in medical image translation. Our code will release lately.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fardin Jalil Piran, Prathyush P. Poduval, Hamza Errahmouni Barkam, Mohsen Imani, Farhad Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models combined with in-situ sensing offer a powerful solution to address defect detection challenges in Additive Manufacturing (AM), yet this integration raises critical data privacy concerns, such as data leakage and sensor data compromise, potentially exposing sensitive information about part design and material composition. Differential Privacy (DP), which adds mathematically controlled noise to ML models, provides a way to balance data utility with privacy by concealing identifiable traces from sensor data. However, introducing noise into ML models, especially black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, complicates the prediction of how noise impacts model accuracy. This study presents the Differential Privacy-Hyperdimensional Computing (DP-HD) framework, which leverages Explainable AI (XAI) and the vector symbolic paradigm to quantify noise effects on accuracy. By defining a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) metric, DP-HD assesses the contribution of training data relative to DP noise, allowing selection of an optimal balance between accuracy and privacy. Experimental results using high-speed melt pool data for anomaly detection in AM demonstrate that DP-HD achieves superior operational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and privacy protection. For instance, with a privacy budget set at 1, DP-HD achieves 94.43% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art ML models. Furthermore, DP-HD maintains high accuracy under substantial noise additions to enhance privacy, unlike current models that experience significant accuracy declines under stringent privacy constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Till Nicke, Jan Raphael Schaefer, Henning Hoefener, Friedrich Feuerhake, Dorit Merhof, Fabian Kiessling, Johannes Lotz</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to the increasing workload of pathologists, the need for automation to support diagnostic tasks and quantitative biomarker evaluation is becoming more and more apparent. Foundation models have the potential to improve generalizability within and across centers and serve as starting points for data efficient development of specialized yet robust AI models. However, the training foundation models themselves is usually very expensive in terms of data, computation, and time. This paper proposes a supervised training method that drastically reduces these expenses. The proposed method is based on multi-task learning to train a joint encoder, by combining 16 different classification, segmentation, and detection tasks on a total of 912,000 patches. Since the encoder is capable of capturing the properties of the samples, we term it the Tissue Concepts encoder. To evaluate the performance and generalizability of the Tissue Concepts encoder across centers, classification of whole slide images from four of the most prevalent solid cancers - breast, colon, lung, and prostate - was used. The experiments show that the Tissue Concepts model achieve comparable performance to models trained with self-supervision, while requiring only 6% of the amount of training patches. Furthermore, the Tissue Concepts encoder outperforms an ImageNet pre-trained encoder on both in-domain and out-of-domain data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongyun Lee, Geewook Kim, Jiyeon Kim, Hyunji Lee, Hoyeon Chang, Sue Hyun Park, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language adaptation (VL adaptation) transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) into Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for multimodal tasks, but this process often compromises the inherent safety capabilities embedded in the original LLMs. Despite potential harmfulness due to weakened safety measures, in-depth analysis on the effects of VL adaptation on safety remains under-explored. This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and evaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that safety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is safe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety datasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks, they still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to over-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that VL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering overall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the objectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often results in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we suggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing safety degradation while maintaining helpfulness. These insights help guide the development of more reliable and secure LVLMs for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of single-photon image sensors has opened the door to a plethora of high-speed and low-light imaging applications. However, data collected by these sensors are often 1-bit or few-bit, and corrupted by noise and strong motion. Conventional video restoration methods are not designed to handle this situation, while specialized quanta burst algorithms have limited performance when the number of input frames is low. In this paper, we introduce Quanta Video Restoration (QUIVER), an end-to-end trainable network built on the core ideas of classical quanta restoration methods, i.e., pre-filtering, flow estimation, fusion, and refinement. We also collect and publish I2-2000FPS, a high-speed video dataset with the highest temporal resolution of 2000 frames-per-second, for training and testing. On simulated and real data, QUIVER outperforms existing quanta restoration methods by a significant margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daehwan Kim, Haejun Chung, Ikbeom Jang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are not well-calibrated and often produce over-confident predictions. The miscalibration issue primarily stems from using cross-entropy in classifications, which aims to align predicted softmax probabilities with one-hot labels. In ordinal regression tasks, this problem is compounded by an additional challenge: the expectation that softmax probabilities should exhibit unimodal distribution is not met with cross-entropy. The ordinal regression literature has focused on learning orders and overlooked calibration. To address both issues, we propose a novel loss function that introduces order-aware calibration, ensuring that prediction confidence adheres to ordinal relationships between classes. It incorporates soft ordinal encoding and order-aware regularization to enforce both calibration and unimodality. Extensive experiments across three popular ordinal regression benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art calibration without compromising accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minfeng Xu, Chen-Chen Fan, Yan-Jie Zhou, Wenchao Guo, Pan Liu, Jing Qi, Le Lu, Hanqing Chao, Kunlun He</p>
<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a leading health concern and contribute significantly to global mortality rates. While clinical advancements have led to a decline in CVD mortality, accurately identifying individuals who could benefit from preventive interventions remains an unsolved challenge in preventive cardiology. Current CVD risk prediction models, recommended by guidelines, are based on limited traditional risk factors or use CT imaging to acquire quantitative biomarkers, and still have limitations in predictive accuracy and applicability. On the other hand, end-to-end trained CVD risk prediction methods leveraging deep learning on CT images often fail to provide transparent and explainable decision grounds for assisting physicians. In this work, we proposed a novel joint representation that integrates discrete quantitative biomarkers and continuous deep features extracted from chest CT scans. Our approach initiated with a deep CVD risk classification model by capturing comprehensive continuous deep learning features while jointly obtaining currently clinical-established quantitative biomarkers via segmentation models. In the feature joint representation stage, we use an instance-wise feature-gated mechanism to align the continuous and discrete features, followed by a soft instance-wise feature interaction mechanism fostering independent and effective feature interaction for the final CVD risk prediction. Our method substantially improves CVD risk predictive performance and offers individual contribution analysis of each biomarker, which is important in assisting physicians' decision-making processes. We validated our method on a public chest low-dose CT dataset and a private external chest standard-dose CT patient cohort of 17,207 CT volumes from 6,393 unique subjects, and demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving AUCs of 0.875 and 0.843, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and is increasingly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Timely interventions can significantly influence stroke survivability and the quality of life after treatment. However, the standard and most widely available imaging method for confirming strokes and their sub-types, the NCCT, is more challenging and time-consuming to employ in cases of ischemic stroke. For this reason, we developed an automated method for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in NCCTs using the nnU-Net frame work, aimed at enhancing early treatment and improving the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients. We achieved Dice scores of 0.596 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.501 on the sampled dataset. After adjusting for outliers, these scores improved to 0.752 for the Dice score and 0.643 for the IoU. Proper delineation of the region of infarction can help clinicians better assess the potential impact of the infarction, and guide treatment procedures.</p>
