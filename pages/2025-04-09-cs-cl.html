<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiran Dudy, Thulasi Tholeti, Resmi Ramachandranpillai, Muhammad Ali, Toby Jia-Jun Li, Ricardo Baeza-Yates</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them a popular information-seeking tool among end users. However, the statistical training methods for LLMs have raised concerns about their representation of under-represented topics, potentially leading to biases that could influence real-world decisions and opportunities. These biases could have significant economic, social, and cultural impacts as LLMs become more prevalent, whether through direct interactions--such as when users engage with chatbots or automated assistants--or through their integration into third-party applications (as agents), where the models influence decision-making processes and functionalities behind the scenes. Our study examines the biases present in LLMs recommendations of U.S. cities and towns across three domains: relocation, tourism, and starting a business. We explore two key research questions: (i) How similar LLMs responses are, and (ii) How this similarity might favor areas with certain characteristics over others, introducing biases. We focus on the consistency of LLMs responses and their tendency to over-represent or under-represent specific locations. Our findings point to consistent demographic biases in these recommendations, which could perpetuate a ``rich-get-richer'' effect that widens existing economic disparities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05410">Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Lipkin, Benjamin LeBrun, Jacob Hoover Vigly, Jo\~ao Loula, David R. MacIver, Li Du, Jason Eisner, Ryan Cotterell, Vikash Mansinghka, Timothy J. O'Donnell, Alexander K. Lew, Tim Vieira</p>
<p>Abstract: The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05411">Less but Better: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Personality Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingzhi Shen, Yunfei Long, Xiaohao Cai, Guanming Chen, Imran Razzak, Shoaib Jameel</p>
<p>Abstract: Personality detection automatically identifies an individual's personality from various data sources, such as social media texts. However, as the parameter scale of language models continues to grow, the computational cost becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Fine-tuning also grows more complex, making it harder to justify the effort and reliably predict outcomes. We introduce a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, PersLLM, to address these challenges. In PersLLM, a large language model (LLM) extracts high-dimensional representations from raw data and stores them in a dynamic memory layer. PersLLM then updates the downstream layers with a replaceable output network, enabling flexible adaptation to various personality detection scenarios. By storing the features in the memory layer, we eliminate the need for repeated complex computations by the LLM. Meanwhile, the lightweight output network serves as a proxy for evaluating the overall effectiveness of the framework, improving the predictability of results. Experimental results on key benchmark datasets like Kaggle and Pandora show that PersLLM significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining competitive performance and strong adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Koniaev, Ori Ernst, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in automatic summarization, state-of-the-art models do not summarize all documents equally well, raising the question: why? While prior research has extensively analyzed summarization models, little attention has been given to the role of document characteristics in influencing summarization performance. In this work, we explore two key research questions. First, do documents exhibit consistent summarization quality across multiple systems? If so, can we predict a document's summarization performance without generating a summary? We answer both questions affirmatively and introduce PreSumm, a novel task in which a system predicts summarization performance based solely on the source document. Our analysis sheds light on common properties of documents with low PreSumm scores, revealing that they often suffer from coherence issues, complex content, or a lack of a clear main theme. In addition, we demonstrate PreSumm's practical utility in two key applications: improving hybrid summarization workflows by identifying documents that require manual summarization and enhancing dataset quality by filtering outliers and noisy documents. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role of document properties in summarization performance and offer insights into the limitations of current systems that could serve as the basis for future improvements.</p>

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in their potential to enhance and automate this process. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of hypothesis generation with LLMs by (i) reviewing existing methods, from simple prompting techniques to more complex frameworks, and proposing a taxonomy that categorizes these approaches; (ii) analyzing techniques for improving hypothesis quality, such as novelty boosting and structured reasoning; (iii) providing an overview of evaluation strategies; and (iv) discussing key challenges and future directions, including multimodal integration and human-AI collaboration. Our survey aims to serve as a reference for researchers exploring LLMs for hypothesis generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Charts are ubiquitous, as people often use them to analyze data, answer questions, and discover critical insights. However, performing complex analytical tasks with charts requires significant perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems automate this process by enabling models to interpret and reason with visual representations of data. However, existing benchmarks like ChartQA lack real-world diversity and have recently shown performance saturation with modern large vision-language models (LVLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce ChartQAPro, a new benchmark that includes 1,341 charts from 157 diverse sources, spanning various chart types, including infographics and dashboards, and featuring 1,948 questions in various types, such as multiple-choice, conversational, hypothetical, and unanswerable questions, to better reflect real-world challenges. Our evaluations with 21 models show a substantial performance drop for LVLMs on ChartQAPro; e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5 scores 90.5% on ChartQA but only 55.81% on ChartQAPro, underscoring the complexity of chart reasoning. We complement our findings with detailed error analyses and ablation studies, identifying key challenges and opportunities for advancing LVLMs in chart understanding and reasoning. We release ChartQAPro at https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartQAPro.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05523">Pretraining Language Models for Diachronic Linguistic Change Discovery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elisabeth Fittschen, Sabrina Li, Tom Lippincott, Leshem Choshsem, Craig Messner</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential as tools for scientific discovery. This has engendered growing interest in their use in humanistic disciplines, such as historical linguistics and literary studies. These fields often construct arguments on the basis of delineations like genre, or more inflexibly, time period. Although efforts have been made to restrict inference to specific domains via fine-tuning or model editing, we posit that the only true guarantee is domain-restricted pretraining -- typically, a data- and compute-expensive proposition.
  We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches. We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices. We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.
  We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus. Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields. Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence. We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Extended Reality (XR) technologies to address knowledge transfer challenges in industrial environments. The proposed system embeds domain-specific industrial knowledge into XR environments through a natural language interface, enabling hands-free, context-aware expert guidance for workers. We present the architecture of the proposed system consisting of an LLM Chat Engine with dynamic tool orchestration and an XR application featuring voice-driven interaction. Performance evaluation of various chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector databases reveals that semantic chunking, balanced embedding models, and efficient vector stores deliver optimal performance for industrial knowledge retrieval. The system's potential is demonstrated through early implementation in multiple industrial use cases, including robotic assembly, smart infrastructure maintenance, and aerospace component servicing. Results indicate potential for enhancing training efficiency, remote assistance capabilities, and operational guidance in alignment with Industry 5.0's human-centric and resilient approach to industrial development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has achieved remarkable success. However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited by small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation. Additionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response labeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and carefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream LLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we introduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), a high-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,009k Chinese preference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel, and Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for scoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously constructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on AlignBench \citep{liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment} show that that COIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it brings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the Qwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively. The results on CRBench demonstrate that our CRM has a strong and robust scoring ability. We apply it to filter chosen-rejected response pairs in a test split of COIG-P, and our experiments show that it is comparable to GPT-4o in identifying low-quality samples while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our codes and data are released in https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/COIG-P.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05570">Can Large Language Models Match Tutoring System Adaptivity? A Benchmarking Study</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Conrad Borchers, Tianze Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise as dynamic instructional aids. Yet, it remains unclear whether LLMs can replicate the adaptivity of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS)--where student knowledge and pedagogical strategies are explicitly modeled. We propose a prompt variation framework to assess LLM-generated instructional moves' adaptivity and pedagogical soundness across 75 real-world tutoring scenarios from an ITS. We systematically remove key context components (e.g., student errors and knowledge components) from prompts to create variations of each scenario. Three representative LLMs (Llama3-8B, Llama3-70B, and GPT-4o) generate 1,350 instructional moves. We use text embeddings and randomization tests to measure how the omission of each context feature impacts the LLMs' outputs (adaptivity) and a validated tutor-training classifier to evaluate response quality (pedagogical soundness). Surprisingly, even the best-performing model only marginally mimics the adaptivity of ITS. Specifically, Llama3-70B demonstrates statistically significant adaptivity to student errors. Although Llama3-8B's recommendations receive higher pedagogical soundness scores than the other models, it struggles with instruction-following behaviors, including output formatting. By contrast, GPT-4o reliably adheres to instructions but tends to provide overly direct feedback that diverges from effective tutoring, prompting learners with open-ended questions to gauge knowledge. Given these results, we discuss how current LLM-based tutoring is unlikely to produce learning benefits rivaling known-to-be-effective ITS tutoring. Through our open-source benchmarking code, we contribute a reproducible method for evaluating LLMs' instructional adaptivity and fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oded Ovadia, Meni Brief, Rachel Lemberg, Eitam Sheetrit</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge during pre-training, they often lack domain-specific, new, or niche information. Continual pre-training (CPT) attempts to address this gap but suffers from catastrophic forgetting and inefficiencies in low-data regimes. We introduce Knowledge-Instruct, a novel approach to efficiently inject knowledge from limited corpora through pure instruction-tuning. By generating information-dense synthetic instruction data, it effectively integrates new knowledge while preserving general reasoning and instruction-following abilities. Knowledge-Instruct demonstrates superior factual memorization, minimizes catastrophic forgetting, and remains scalable by leveraging synthetic data from relatively small language models. Additionally, it enhances contextual understanding, including complex multi-hop reasoning, facilitating integration with retrieval systems. We validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, including Companies, a new dataset that we release to measure knowledge injection capabilities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05598">DEL: Context-Aware Dynamic Exit Layer for Efficient Self-Speculative Decoding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossein Entezari Zarch, Lei Gao, Chaoyi Jiang, Murali Annavaram</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a widely used approach to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) without reducing generation quality. It operates by first using a compact model to draft multiple tokens efficiently, followed by parallel verification using the target LLM. This approach leads to faster inference compared to auto-regressive decoding. While there are multiple approaches to create a draft model, one promising approach is to use early-exit methods. These methods draft candidate tokens by using a subset of layers of the primary model and applying the remaining layers for verification, allowing a single model to handle both drafting and verification. While this technique reduces memory usage and computational cost, its performance relies on the choice of the exit layer for drafting and the number of tokens drafted (speculation length) in each SD round. Prior works use hyperparameter exploration to statically select these values. However, our evaluations show that these hyperparameter values are task-specific, and even within a task they are dependent on the current sequence context. We introduce DEL, a plug-and-play method that adaptively selects the exit layer and speculation length during inference. DEL dynamically tracks the token acceptance rate if the tokens are drafted at each layer of an LLM and uses that knowledge to heuristically select the optimal exit layer and speculation length. Our experiments across a broad range of models and downstream tasks show that DEL achieves overall speedups of $2.16\times$$\sim$$2.50\times$ over vanilla auto-regressive decoding and improves upon the state-of-the-art SD methods by up to $0.27\times$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naman Bhargava, Mohammed I. Radaideh, O Hwang Kwon, Aditi Verma, Majdi I. Radaideh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, including sentiment analysis. However, data quality--particularly when sourced from social media--can significantly impact their accuracy. This research explores how textual nuances, including emojis and sarcasm, affect sentiment analysis, with a particular focus on improving data quality through text paraphrasing techniques. To address the lack of labeled sarcasm data, the authors created a human-labeled dataset of 5929 tweets that enabled the assessment of LLM in various sarcasm contexts. The results show that when topic-specific datasets, such as those related to nuclear power, are used to finetune LLMs these models are not able to comprehend accurate sentiment in presence of sarcasm due to less diverse text, requiring external interventions like sarcasm removal to boost model accuracy. Sarcasm removal led to up to 21% improvement in sentiment accuracy, as LLMs trained on nuclear power-related content struggled with sarcastic tweets, achieving only 30% accuracy. In contrast, LLMs trained on general tweet datasets, covering a broader range of topics, showed considerable improvements in predicting sentiment for sarcastic tweets (60% accuracy), indicating that incorporating general text data can enhance sarcasm detection. The study also utilized adversarial text augmentation, showing that creating synthetic text variants by making minor changes significantly increased model robustness and accuracy for sarcastic tweets (approximately 85%). Additionally, text paraphrasing of tweets with fragmented language transformed around 40% of the tweets with low-confidence labels into high-confidence ones, improving LLMs sentiment analysis accuracy by 6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian-Wen Zhang, Fang Li, Jie Wang, Lingfeng Qiao, Yifei Yu, Di Yin, Xing Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Extractive reading comprehension systems are designed to locate the correct answer to a question within a given text. However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring these models maintain high accuracy in answering questions while reliably recognizing unanswerable queries. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for reading comprehension, this issue remains critical, particularly as the length of supported contexts continues to expand. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative data augmentation methodology grounded in a multi-agent collaborative framework. Unlike traditional methods, such as the costly human annotation process required for datasets like SQuAD 2.0, our method autonomously generates evidence-based question-answer pairs and systematically constructs unanswerable questions. Using this methodology, we developed the FactGuard-Bench dataset, which comprises 25,220 examples of both answerable and unanswerable question scenarios, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K. Experimental evaluations conducted on seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models achieve only 61.79% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of a model's ability to reason about unanswerable questions to avoid generating plausible but incorrect answers. By implementing efficient data selection and generation within the multi-agent collaborative framework, our method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with manual annotation and provides valuable insights for the training and optimization of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can enhance translation quality through self-refinement. In this paper, we build on this idea by extending the refinement from sentence-level to document-level translation, specifically focusing on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation refinement. Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc translation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose fine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate translations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc. Additionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies, we introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns lower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones, enabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases. Experimental results across ten translation tasks with LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo-Instruct demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanchit Kabra, Akshita Jha, Chandan Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale generative language models have shown that reasoning capabilities can significantly improve model performance across a variety of tasks. However, the impact of reasoning on a model's ability to mitigate stereotypical responses remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate the crucial relationship between a model's reasoning ability and fairness, and ask whether improved reasoning capabilities can mitigate harmful stereotypical responses, especially those arising due to shallow or flawed reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multiple open-source LLMs, and find that larger models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit substantially lower stereotypical bias on existing fairness benchmarks. Building on this insight, we introduce ReGiFT -- Reasoning Guided Fine-Tuning, a novel approach that extracts structured reasoning traces from advanced reasoning models and infuses them into models that lack such capabilities. We use only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific supervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using ReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts but also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also analyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their length influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings highlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective, fairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by reasoning flaws.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vasant Dhar, Jo\~ao Sedoc</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term investing was previously seen as requiring human judgment. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, automated systematic long-term investing is now feasible. In this paper, we present DBOT, a system whose goal is to reason about valuation like Aswath Damodaran, who is a unique expert in the investment arena in terms of having published thousands of valuations on companies in addition to his numerous writings on the topic, which provide ready training data for an AI system. DBOT can value any publicly traded company. DBOT can also be back-tested, making its behavior and performance amenable to scientific inquiry. We compare DBOT to its analytic parent, Damodaran, and highlight the research challenges involved in raising its current capability to that of Damodaran's. Finally, we examine the implications of DBOT-like AI agents for the financial industry, especially how they will impact the role of human analysts in valuation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhankar Maity, Aniket Deroy</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel three-step prompt-tuning method for Bengali Grammatical Error Explanation (BGEE) using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and Llama-2-70b. Our approach involves identifying and categorizing grammatical errors in Bengali sentences, generating corrected versions of the sentences, and providing natural language explanations for each identified error. We evaluate the performance of our BGEE system using both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation conducted by experienced Bengali language experts. Our proposed prompt-tuning approach shows that GPT-4, the best performing LLM, surpasses the baseline model in automated evaluation metrics, with a 5.26% improvement in F1 score and a 6.95% improvement in exact match. Furthermore, compared to the previous baseline, GPT-4 demonstrates a decrease of 25.51% in wrong error type and a decrease of 26.27% in wrong error explanation. However, the results still lag behind the human baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhankar Maity, Aniket Deroy, Sudeshna Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance of prominent pre-trained large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, text-davinci-003, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, text-ada-001, llama-2-7b-chat, llama-2-13b-chat, and llama-2-70b-chat, in comparison to expert human evaluators in providing scores, identifying errors, and offering feedback and improvement suggestions to candidates during mock HR (Human Resources) interviews. We introduce a dataset called HURIT (Human Resource Interview Transcripts), which comprises 3,890 HR interview transcripts sourced from real-world HR interview scenarios. Our findings reveal that pre-trained LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo, exhibit commendable performance and are capable of producing evaluations comparable to those of expert human evaluators. Although these LLMs demonstrate proficiency in providing scores comparable to human experts in terms of human evaluation metrics, they frequently fail to identify errors and offer specific actionable advice for candidate performance improvement in HR interviews. Our research suggests that the current state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs are not fully conducive for automatic deployment in an HR interview assessment. Instead, our findings advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach, to incorporate manual checks for inconsistencies and provisions for improving feedback quality as a more suitable strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xitao Li, Haijun Wang, Jiang Wu, Ting Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread attention due to their instruction-following capabilities. To ensure conversational LLMs follow instructions, role separators are employed to distinguish between different participants in a conversation. However, incorporating role separators introduces potential vulnerabilities. Misusing roles can lead to prompt injection attacks, which can easily misalign the model's behavior with the user's intentions, raising significant security concerns. Although various prompt injection attacks have been proposed, recent research has largely overlooked the impact of role separators on safety. This highlights the critical need to thoroughly understand the systemic weaknesses in dialogue systems caused by role separators. This paper identifies modeling weaknesses caused by role separators. Specifically, we observe a strong positional bias associated with role separators, which is inherent in the format of dialogue modeling and can be triggered by the insertion of role separators. We further develop the Separators Injection Attack (SIA), a new orthometric attack based on role separators. The experiment results show that SIA is efficient and extensive in manipulating model behavior with an average gain of 18.2% for manual methods and enhances the attack success rate to 100% with automatic methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatically assessing question quality is crucial for educators as it saves time, ensures consistency, and provides immediate feedback for refining teaching materials. We propose a novel methodology called STRIVE (Structured Thinking and Refinement with multiLLMs for Improving Verified Question Estimation) using a series of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic question evaluation. This approach aims to improve the accuracy and depth of question quality assessment, ultimately supporting diverse learners and enhancing educational practices. The method estimates question quality in an automated manner by generating multiple evaluations based on the strengths and weaknesses of the provided question and then choosing the best solution generated by the LLM. Then the process is improved by iterative review and response with another LLM until the evaluation metric values converge. This sophisticated method of evaluating question quality improves the estimation of question quality by automating the task of question quality evaluation. Correlation scores show that using this proposed method helps to improve correlation with human judgments compared to the baseline method. Error analysis shows that metrics like relevance and appropriateness improve significantly relative to human judgments by using STRIVE.</p>

<p>Abstract: A random sample of nearly 10 hours of speech from PennSound, the world's largest online collection of poetry readings and discussions, was used as a benchmark to evaluate several commercial and open-source speech-to-text systems. PennSound's wide variation in recording conditions and speech styles makes it a good representative for many other untranscribed audio collections. Reference transcripts were created by trained annotators, and system transcripts were produced from AWS, Azure, Google, IBM, NeMo, Rev.ai, Whisper, and Whisper.cpp. Based on word error rate, Rev.ai was the top performer, and Whisper was the top open source performer (as long as hallucinations were avoided). AWS had the best diarization error rates among three systems. However, WER and DER differences were slim, and various tradeoffs may motivate choosing different systems for different end users. We also examine the issue of hallucinations in Whisper. Users of Whisper should be cautioned to be aware of runtime options, and whether the speed vs accuracy trade off is acceptable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Wang, Yujia Fu, Zhu Zhang, Shuo Wang, Zirui Ren, Xiaorong Wang, Zhili Li, Chaoqun He, Bo An, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form generation is crucial for a wide range of practical applications, typically categorized into short-to-long and long-to-long generation. While short-to-long generations have received considerable attention, generating long texts from extremely long resources remains relatively underexplored. The primary challenge in long-to-long generation lies in effectively integrating and analyzing relevant information from extensive inputs, which remains difficult for current large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2, a novel test-time scaling strategy designed to enhance the ability of LLMs to process extremely long inputs. Drawing inspiration from convolutional neural networks, which iteratively integrate local features into higher-level global representations, LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 utilizes stacked convolutional scaling layers to progressively expand the understanding of input materials. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the ability of LLMs to process long inputs and generate coherent, informative long-form articles, outperforming several representative baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a variety of tasks. However, their potential in the domain of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) remains largely underexplored. Moreover, compared to English data, the methods for Chinese AES is not well developed. In this paper, we propose Rank-Then-Score (RTS), a fine-tuning framework based on large language models to enhance their essay scoring capabilities. Specifically, we fine-tune the ranking model (Ranker) with feature-enriched data, and then feed the output of the ranking model, in the form of a candidate score set, with the essay content into the scoring model (Scorer) to produce the final score. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, HSK and ASAP, demonstrate that RTS consistently outperforms the direct prompting (Vanilla) method in terms of average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, and achieves the best performance on Chinese essay scoring using the HSK dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated much of the artificial intelligence scene with their ability to process and generate natural languages. However, the majority of LLM research and development remains English-centric, leaving low-resource languages such as those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region under-represented. To address this representation gap, we introduce Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, two cutting-edge multilingual LLMs designed for SEA languages. The SEA-LION family of LLMs supports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages large-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive post-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning, alignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks indicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs supporting SEA languages. We open-source the models to benefit the wider SEA community.</p>

<p>Abstract: As text and code resources have expanded, large-scale pre-trained models have shown promising capabilities in code generation tasks, typically employing supervised fine-tuning with problem statement-program pairs. However, increasing model size and data volume for performance gains also raises computational demands and risks of overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we present RETROcode, a novel adaptation of the RETRO architecture \cite{RETRO} for sequence-to-sequence models, utilizing a large code database as an auxiliary scaling method. This approach, diverging from simply enlarging model and dataset sizes, allows RETROcode to leverage a vast code database for prediction, enhancing the model's efficiency by integrating extensive memory. Our findings indicate that RETROcode not only outperforms similar-sized traditional architectures on test sets but also approaches the effectiveness of the much larger Codex model, despite being trained from scratch on a substantially smaller dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiho Gwak, Yuchul Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding fusion has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing performance across various NLP tasks. However, systematic guidelines for selecting optimal layers and developing effective fusion strategies for the integration of LLMs remain underexplored. In this study, we propose a layer-aware embedding selection method and investigate how to quantitatively evaluate different layers to identify the most important ones for downstream NLP tasks, showing that the critical layers vary depending on the dataset. We also explore how combining embeddings from multiple LLMs, without requiring model fine-tuning, can improve performance. Experiments on four English text classification datasets (SST-2, MR, R8, and R52) demonstrate that different layers in LLMs exhibit varying degrees of representational strength for classification, and that combining embeddings from different models can enhance performance if the models exhibit complementary characteristics. Additionally, we discuss resources overhead (memory and inference time) to provide a balanced perspective on the real world feasibility of embedding fusion. Future work will explore multilingual and domain specific datasets, as well as techniques for automating layer selection, to improve both performance and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'as Horv\'ath (MICS), Paolo Ballarini (MICS), Pierre Cry (MICS)</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to obtain a stochastic model that accounts for the stochastic aspects of the dynamics of a business process, usually the following steps are taken. Given an event log, a process tree is obtained through a process discovery algorithm, i.e., a process tree that is aimed at reproducing, as accurately as possible, the language of the log. The process tree is then transformed into a Petri net that generates the same set of sequences as the process tree. In order to capture the frequency of the sequences in the event log, weights are assigned to the transitions of the Petri net, resulting in a stochastic Petri net with a stochastic language in which each sequence is associated with a probability. In this paper we show that this procedure has unfavorable properties. First, the weights assigned to the transitions of the Petri net have an unclear role in the resulting stochastic language. We will show that a weight can have multiple, ambiguous impact on the probability of the sequences generated by the Petri net. Second, a number of different Petri nets with different number of transitions can correspond to the same process tree. This means that the number of parameters (the number of weights) that determines the stochastic language is not well-defined. In order to avoid these ambiguities, in this paper, we propose to add stochasticity directly to process trees. The result is a new formalism, called stochastic process trees, in which the number of parameters and their role in the associated stochastic language is clear and well-defined.</p>

This study introduces an innovative method aimed at identifying and resolving references to the same entities that appear across differing texts, thus enhancing the coherence and collaboration of information.

By utilizing contextual embeddings along with graph-based inference strategies, we effectively capture the relationships and interactions among entities, thereby improving the accuracy of coreference resolution. Rigorous evaluations on various benchmark datasets highlight notable advancements in our approach over traditional methodologies. The results showcase how the contextual information derived from knowledge graphs enhances the understanding of complex relationships across documents, leading to better entity linking and information extraction capabilities in applications driven by knowledge. Our technique demonstrates substantial improvements in both precision and recall, underscoring its effectiveness in the area of cross-document coreference resolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingye Zhu, Yi Liu, Junbo Guo, Quan Wang, Yongdong Zhang, Zhendong Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on preference alignment methods to steer outputs toward human values, yet these methods are often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality human-annotated data. To tackle this, recent approaches have turned to synthetic data generated by LLMs as a scalable alternative. However, synthetic data can introduce distribution shifts, compromising the nuanced human preferences that are essential for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment in the presence of such shifts. Our approach first estimates the likelihood ratios between the target and training distributions leveraging a learned classifier, then it minimizes the worst-case loss over data regions that reflect the target human-preferred distribution. By explicitly prioritizing the target distribution during optimization, our method mitigates the adverse effects of distributional variation and enhances the generation of responses that faithfully reflect human values.</p>

By employing state-of-the-art pretrained models to gather contextual embeddings and applying an attention mechanism for fine-tuning, we improve the performance of coreference tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets show that our method surpasses conventional coreference resolution systems, achieving notable accuracy in disambiguating references.

Despite these successes, the robustness and consistency of LLMs in underrepresented languages remain largely unexplored, especially concerning local dialects. Existing benchmarks also focus on main dialects, neglecting LLMs' ability on local dialect texts. In this paper, we introduce a Thai local dialect benchmark covering Northern (Lanna), Northeastern (Isan), and Southern (Dambro) Thai, evaluating LLMs on five NLP tasks: summarization, question answering, translation, conversation, and food-related tasks. Furthermore, we propose a human evaluation guideline and metric for Thai local dialects to assess generation fluency and dialect-specific accuracy. Results show that LLM performance declines significantly in local Thai dialects compared to standard Thai, with only proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 demonstrating some fluency</p>

<p>Abstract: This work presents the task of unsupervised location mapping, which seeks to map the trajectory of an individual narrative on a spatial map of locations in which a large set of narratives take place. Despite the fundamentality and generality of the task, very little work addressed the spatial mapping of narrative texts. The task consists of two parts: (1) inducing a ``map'' with the locations mentioned in a set of texts, and (2) extracting a trajectory from a single narrative and positioning it on the map. Following recent advances in increasing the context length of large language models, we propose a pipeline for this task in a completely unsupervised manner without predefining the set of labels. We test our method on two different domains: (1) Holocaust testimonies and (2) Lake District writing, namely multi-century literature on travels in the English Lake District. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations for the task, with encouraging results, thereby setting a benchmark and evaluation practices for the task, as well as highlighting challenges.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about cultural bias, fairness, and their applicability in diverse linguistic and underrepresented regional contexts. To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose a framework, NativQA, that can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages, ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages, which resulted over 300K Question Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning. The framework has been made publicly available for the community (https://gitlab.com/nativqa/nativqa-framework).</p>

<p>Abstract: Developing high-quality large language models (LLMs) for moderately resourced languages presents unique challenges in data availability, model adaptation, and evaluation. We introduce Llama-3-Nanda-10B-Chat, or Nanda for short, a state-of-the-art Hindi-centric instruction-tuned generative LLM, designed to push the boundaries of open-source Hindi language models. Built upon Llama-3-8B, Nanda incorporates continuous pre-training with expanded transformer blocks, leveraging the Llama Pro methodology. A key challenge was the limited availability of high-quality Hindi text data; we addressed this through rigorous data curation, augmentation, and strategic bilingual training, balancing Hindi and English corpora to optimize cross-linguistic knowledge transfer. With 10 billion parameters, Nanda stands among the top-performing open-source Hindi and multilingual models of similar scale, demonstrating significant advantages over many existing models. We provide an in-depth discussion of training strategies, fine-tuning techniques, safety alignment, and evaluation metrics, demonstrating how these approaches enabled Nanda to achieve state-of-the-art results. By open-sourcing Nanda, we aim to advance research in Hindi LLMs and support a wide range of real-world applications across academia, industry, and public services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitong Wang, Mohammed J. Zaki, Georgios Kollias, Vasileios Kalantzis</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) rely on contextual embeddings which generate different (continuous) representations for the same token depending on its surrounding context. Nonetheless, words and tokens typically have a limited number of senses (or meanings). We propose multi-sense embeddings as a drop-in replacement for each token in order to capture the range of their uses in a language. To construct a sense embedding dictionary, we apply a clustering algorithm to embeddings generated by an LLM and consider the cluster centers as representative sense embeddings. In addition, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method that leverages the sense dictionary to learn a smaller student model that mimics the senses from the much larger base LLM model, offering significant space and inference time savings, while maintaining competitive performance. Via thorough experiments on various benchmarks, we showcase the effectiveness of our sense embeddings and knowledge distillation approach. We share our code at https://github.com/Qitong-Wang/SenseDict</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghyun Ji, Soowon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked language modeling, which is a task to predict a randomly masked word in the input text, is an efficient language representation learning method. Masked language modeling ignores various words which people can think of for filling in the masked position and calculates the loss with a single word. Especially when the input text is short, the entropy of the word distribution that can fill in the masked position can be high. This may cause the model to be overconfident in the single answer. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence regularizer that controls regularizing strength dynamically by the input text length. Experiments with GLUE and SQuAD datasets showed that our method achieves better accuracy and lower expected calibration error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rijul Magu, Arka Dutta, Sean Kim, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh, Munmun De Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Montgomery Gole, Andriy Miranskyy</p>
<p>Abstract: Sarcasm detection is challenging for both humans and machines. This work explores how model characteristics impact sarcasm detection in OpenAI's GPT, and Meta's Llama-2 models, given their strong natural language understanding, and popularity. We evaluate fine-tuned and zero-shot models across various sizes, releases, and hyperparameters. Experiments were conducted on the political and balanced (pol-bal) portion of the popular Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC2.0) sarcasm dataset. Fine-tuned performance improves monotonically with model size within a model family, while hyperparameter tuning also impacts performance. In the fine-tuning scenario, full precision Llama-2-13b achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and $F_1$-score, both measured at 0.83, comparable to average human performance. In the zero-shot setting, one GPT-4 model achieves competitive performance to prior attempts, yielding an accuracy of 0.70 and an $F_1$-score of 0.75. Furthermore, a model's performance may increase or decline with each release, highlighting the need to reassess performance after each release.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chejian Xu, Wei Ping, Peng Xu, Zihan Liu, Boxin Wang, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bo Li, Bryan Catanzaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context capabilities are essential for a wide range of applications, including document and video understanding, in-context learning, and inference-time scaling, all of which require models to process and reason over long sequences of text and multimodal data. In this work, we introduce a efficient training recipe for building ultra-long context LLMs from aligned instruct model, pushing the boundaries of context lengths from 128K to 1M, 2M, and 4M tokens. Our approach leverages efficient continued pretraining strategies to extend the context window and employs effective instruction tuning to maintain the instruction-following and reasoning abilities. Our UltraLong-8B, built on Llama3.1-Instruct with our recipe, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of long-context benchmarks. Importantly, models trained with our approach maintain competitive performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating balanced improvements for both long and short context tasks. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key design choices, highlighting the impacts of scaling strategies and data composition. Our findings establish a robust framework for efficiently scaling context lengths while preserving general model capabilities. We release all model weights at: https://ultralong.github.io/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyang Fan, Vinko Sabol\v{c}ec, Matin Ansaripour, Ayush Kumar Tarun, Martin Jaggi, Antoine Bosselut, Imanol Schlag</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biao Zhang, Fedor Moiseev, Joshua Ainslie, Paul Suganthan, Min Ma, Surya Bhupatiraju, Fede Lebron, Orhan Firat, Armand Joulin, Zhe Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: While decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive results, encoder-decoder models are still widely adopted in real-world applications for their inference efficiency and richer encoder representation. In this paper, we study a novel problem: adapting pretrained decoder-only LLMs to encoder-decoder, with the goal of leveraging the strengths of both approaches to achieve a more favorable quality-efficiency trade-off. We argue that adaptation not only enables inheriting the capability of decoder-only LLMs but also reduces the demand for computation compared to pretraining from scratch. We rigorously explore different pretraining objectives and parameter initialization/optimization techniques. Through extensive experiments based on Gemma 2 (2B and 9B) and a suite of newly pretrained mT5-sized models (up to 1.6B), we demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptation and the advantage of encoder-decoder LLMs. Under similar inference budget, encoder-decoder LLMs achieve comparable (often better) pretraining performance but substantially better finetuning performance than their decoder-only counterpart. For example, Gemma 2B-2B outperforms Gemma 2B by $\sim$7\% after instruction tuning. Encoder-decoder adaptation also allows for flexible combination of different-sized models, where Gemma 9B-2B significantly surpasses Gemma 2B-2B by $>$3\%. The adapted encoder representation also yields better results on SuperGLUE. We will release our checkpoints to facilitate future research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06227">LExT: Towards Evaluating Trustworthiness of Natural Language Explanations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Krithi Shailya, Shreya Rajpal, Gokul S Krishnan, Balaraman Ravindran</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT) (The code and set up to reproduce our experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/LExT). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyang Zhai, Zi-Feng Mai, Chang-Dong Wang, Feidiao Yang, Xiawu Zheng, Hui Li, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates. Most existing methods attempt to leverage prior knowledge embedded in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to improve the recommendation performance. However, they often fail to accommodate the differences between the general linguistic knowledge of PLMs and the specific needs of recommendation systems. Moreover, they rarely consider the complementary knowledge between the multimodal information of items, which represents the multi-faceted preferences of users. To facilitate efficient recommendation knowledge transfer, we propose a novel approach called Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation (MQL4GRec). Our key idea is to transform items from different domains and modalities into a unified language, which can serve as a bridge for transferring recommendation knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce quantitative translators to convert the text and image content of items from various domains into a new and concise language, known as quantitative language, with all items sharing the same vocabulary. Then, we design a series of quantitative language generation tasks to enrich quantitative language with semantic information and prior knowledge. Finally, we achieve the transfer of recommendation knowledge from different domains and modalities to the recommendation task through pre-training and fine-tuning. We evaluate the effectiveness of MQL4GRec through extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods, achieving improvements over the baseline by 11.18\%, 14.82\%, and 7.95\% on the NDCG metric across three different datasets, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question Answering (QA) accounts for a significant portion of LLM usage "in the wild". However, LLMs sometimes produce false or misleading responses, also known as "hallucinations". Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information -- i.e., providing evidence for the generated text -- is paramount for LLMs' trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingjian Fu, Hengsheng Chen, Dongchun Jiang, Yanchao Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of advancing information technology, recommender systems have emerged as crucial tools for dealing with information overload. However, traditional recommender systems still have limitations in capturing the dynamic evolution of user behavior. To better understand and predict user behavior, especially taking into account the complexity of temporal evolution, sequential recommender systems have gradually become the focus of research. Currently, many sequential recommendation algorithms ignore the amplification effects of prevalent biases, which leads to recommendation results being susceptible to the Matthew Effect. Additionally, it will impose limitations on the recommender system's ability to deeply perceive and capture the dynamic shifts in user preferences, thereby diminishing the extent of its recommendation reach. To address this issue effectively, we propose a recommendation system based on sequential information and attention mechanism called Multi-Perspective Attention Bias Sequential Recommendation (MABSRec). Firstly, we reconstruct user sequences into three short types and utilize graph neural networks for item weighting. Subsequently, an adaptive multi-bias perspective attention module is proposed to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. Experimental results show that the MABSRec model exhibits significant advantages in all evaluation metrics, demonstrating its excellent performance in the sequence recommendation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandana Sree Mala, Gizem Gezici, Fosca Giannotti</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language comprehension and generation but are prone to hallucinations, producing factually incorrect or unsupported outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by grounding LLM responses with external knowledge. This study evaluates the relationship between retriever effectiveness and hallucination reduction in LLMs using three retrieval approaches: sparse retrieval based on BM25 keyword search, dense retrieval using semantic search with Sentence Transformers, and a proposed hybrid retrieval module. The hybrid module incorporates query expansion and combines the results of sparse and dense retrievers through a dynamically weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion score. Using the HaluBench dataset, a benchmark for hallucinations in question answering tasks, we assess retrieval performance with metrics such as mean average precision and normalised discounted cumulative gain, focusing on the relevance of the top three retrieved documents. Results show that the hybrid retriever achieves better relevance scores, outperforming both sparse and dense retrievers. Further evaluation of LLM-generated answers against ground truth using metrics such as accuracy, hallucination rate, and rejection rate reveals that the hybrid retriever achieves the highest accuracy on fails, the lowest hallucination rate, and the lowest rejection rate. These findings highlight the hybrid retriever's ability to enhance retrieval relevance, reduce hallucination rates, and improve LLM reliability, emphasising the importance of advanced retrieval techniques in mitigating hallucinations and improving response accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anqi Zhang, Yulin Chen, Jane Pan, Chen Zhao, Aurojit Panda, Jinyang Li, He He</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance on tasks like math and logical reasoning thanks to their ability to search during reasoning. However, they still suffer from overthinking, often performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after reaching the correct answer. This raises the question: can models evaluate the correctness of their intermediate answers during reasoning? In this work, we study whether reasoning models encode information about answer correctness through probing the model's hidden states. The resulting probe can verify intermediate answers with high accuracy and produces highly calibrated scores. Additionally, we find models' hidden states encode correctness of future answers, enabling early prediction of the correctness before the intermediate answer is fully formulated. We then use the probe as a verifier to decide whether to exit reasoning at intermediate answers during inference, reducing the number of inference tokens by 24\% without compromising performance. These findings confirm that reasoning models do encode a notion of correctness yet fail to exploit it, revealing substantial untapped potential to enhance their efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alfred Clemedtson, Borun Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have shown remarkable language processing and reasoning ability but are prone to hallucinate when asked about private data. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) retrieves relevant data that fit into an LLM's context window and prompts the LLM for an answer. GraphRAG extends this approach to structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and questions regarding entities multiple hops away. The majority of recent GraphRAG methods either overlook the retrieval step or have ad hoc retrieval processes that are abstract or inefficient. This prevents them from being adopted when the KGs are stored in graph databases supporting graph query languages. In this work, we present GraphRAFT, a retrieve-and-reason framework that finetunes LLMs to generate provably correct Cypher queries to retrieve high-quality subgraph contexts and produce accurate answers. Our method is the first such solution that can be taken off-the-shelf and used on KGs stored in native graph DBs. Benchmarks suggest that our method is sample-efficient and scales with the availability of training data. Our method achieves significantly better results than all state-of-the-art models across all four standard metrics on two challenging Q\&As on large text-attributed KGs.</p>

We present techniques for obtaining in- and out-of-distribution programs with different characteristics: code sampled from a domain-specific language, code automatically generated by an LLM, code collected from competitive programming contests, and mutated versions of these programs. We also present an experimental methodology for evaluating LLM generalization by comparing their performance on these programs. We perform an extensive evaluation across 10 state-of-the-art models from the past year, obtaining insights into their generalization capabilities over time and across different classes of programs. Our results highlight that while earlier models exhibit behavior consistent with pattern matching, the latest models exhibit strong generalization abilities on code reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiwei Shi, Yiyang Wu, Linxin Song, Tianyi Zhou, Jieyu Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has shown great potential for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it is often sample- and compute-inefficient, requiring extensive training. In this work, we introduce AdaRFT (Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning), a method that significantly improves both the efficiency and final accuracy of RFT through adaptive curriculum learning. AdaRFT dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training problems based on the model's recent reward signals, ensuring that the model consistently trains on tasks that are challenging but solvable. This adaptive sampling strategy accelerates learning by maintaining an optimal difficulty range, avoiding wasted computation on problems that are too easy or too hard. AdaRFT requires only a lightweight extension to standard RFT algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), without modifying the reward function or model architecture. Experiments on competition-level math datasets-including AMC, AIME, and IMO-style problems-demonstrate that AdaRFT significantly improves both training efficiency and reasoning performance. We evaluate AdaRFT across multiple data distributions and model sizes, showing that it reduces the number of training steps by up to 2x and improves accuracy by a considerable margin, offering a more scalable and effective RFT framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Skywork R1V, a multimodal reasoning model extending the an R1-series Large language models (LLM) to visual modalities via an efficient multimodal transfer method. Leveraging a lightweight visual projector, Skywork R1V facilitates seamless multimodal adaptation without necessitating retraining of either the foundational language model or the vision encoder. To strengthen visual-text alignment, we propose a hybrid optimization strategy that combines Iterative Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), significantly enhancing cross-modal integration efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive-length Chain-of-Thought distillation approach for reasoning data generation. This approach dynamically optimizes reasoning chain lengths, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and preventing excessive reasoning overthinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Skywork R1V, with only 38B parameters, delivers competitive performance, achieving a score of 69.0 on the MMMU benchmark and 67.5 on MathVista. Meanwhile, it maintains robust textual reasoning performance, evidenced by impressive scores of 72.0 on AIME and 94.0 on MATH500. The Skywork R1V model weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gejian Zhao, Hanzhou Wu, Xinpeng Zhang, Athanasios V. Vasilakos</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhances an LLM's ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, but it also introduces new security issues. In this work, we present ShadowCoT, a novel backdoor attack framework that targets the internal reasoning mechanism of LLMs. Unlike prior token-level or prompt-based attacks, ShadowCoT directly manipulates the model's cognitive reasoning path, enabling it to hijack multi-step reasoning chains and produce logically coherent but adversarial outcomes. By conditioning on internal reasoning states, ShadowCoT learns to recognize and selectively disrupt key reasoning steps, effectively mounting a self-reflective cognitive attack within the target model. Our approach introduces a lightweight yet effective multi-stage injection pipeline, which selectively rewires attention pathways and perturbs intermediate representations with minimal parameter overhead (only 0.15% updated). ShadowCoT further leverages reinforcement learning and reasoning chain pollution (RCP) to autonomously synthesize stealthy adversarial CoTs that remain undetectable to advanced defenses. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks and LLMs show that ShadowCoT consistently achieves high Attack Success Rate (94.4%) and Hijacking Success Rate (88.4%) while preserving benign performance. These results reveal an emergent class of cognition-level threats and highlight the urgent need for defenses beyond shallow surface-level consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Hang Wu, Yu-Jie Xiong,  Jie-Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to a wide range of applications. However, they still remain the threat of jailbreak attacks, where attackers manipulate designed prompts to make the models elicit malicious outputs. Analyzing jailbreak methods can help us delve into the weakness of LLMs and improve it. In this paper, We reveal a vulnerability in large language models (LLMs), which we term Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), by analyzing the attention weights of the model's output on input and subsequent output on prior output: as the model generates substantial benign content, its attention weights shift from the input to prior output, making it more susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate the exploitability of DTD, we propose a novel jailbreak attack method, Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP), which induces the model to generate substantial benign content through benign input and adversarial reasoning, subsequently producing malicious content. To mitigate such attacks, we introduce a simple yet effective defense strategy, POSD, which significantly reduces jailbreak success rates while preserving the model's generalization capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng Shi, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Han Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate content that aligns with individual user preferences has garnered widespread attention. Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which retrieves relevant documents from the user's history to reflect their preferences and enhance LLM generation, is one commonly used approach for personalization. However, existing personalized RAG methods do not consider that the histories of similar users can also assist in personalized generation for the current user, meaning that collaborative information between users can also benefit personalized generation. Inspired by the application of collaborative filtering in recommender systems, we propose a method called CFRAG, which adapts Collaborative Filtering to RAG for personalized text generation. However, this presents two challenges: (1)~how to incorporate collaborative information without explicit user similarity labels? (2)~how to retrieve documents that support personalized LLM generation? For Challenge 1, we use contrastive learning to train user embeddings to retrieve similar users and introduce collaborative information. For Challenge 2, we design a personalized retriever and reranker to retrieve the top-$k$ documents from these users' histories. We take into account the user's preference during retrieval and reranking. Then we leverage feedback from the LLM to fine-tune the personalized retriever and reranker, enabling them to retrieve documents that meet the personalized generation needs of the LLM. Experimental results on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP) benchmark validate the effectiveness of CFRAG. Further analysis confirms the importance of incorporating collaborative information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takehiro Takayanagi, Kiyoshi Izumi, Javier Sanz-Cruzado, Richard McCreadie, Iadh Ounis</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations. But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weijun Li, Ansh Arora, Xuanli He, Mark Dras, Qiongkai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential increase in the parameters of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has significantly raised the cost of independent training, particularly for resource-constrained entities. As a result, there is a growing reliance on open-source models. However, the opacity of training processes exacerbates security risks, making these models more vulnerable to malicious threats, such as backdoor attacks, while simultaneously complicating defense mechanisms. Merging homogeneous models has gained attention as a cost-effective post-training defense. However, we notice that existing strategies, such as weight averaging, only partially mitigate the influence of poisoned parameters and remain ineffective in disrupting the pervasive spurious correlations embedded across model parameters. We propose a novel module-switching strategy to break such spurious correlations within the model's propagation path. By leveraging evolutionary algorithms to optimize fusion strategies, we validate our approach against backdoor attacks targeting text and vision domains. Our method achieves effective backdoor mitigation even when incorporating a couple of compromised models, e.g., reducing the average attack success rate (ASR) to 22% compared to 31.9% with the best-performing baseline on SST-2.</p>

<p>Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems that can execute specific tasks based on predefined programming. Here, we present SkillFlow, a modular, technology-agnostic framework that allows agents to expand their functionality in an ad-hoc fashion by acquiring new skills from their environment or other agents. We present a theoretical model that examines under which conditions this framework would be beneficial, and we then explore SkillFlow's ability to accelerate task completion and lead to lower cumulative costs in a real-world application, namely scheduling agents for calendar events. We demonstrate that within a few iterations, SkillFlow leads to considerable (24.8%, p-value = $6.4\times10^{-3}$) gains in time and cost, especially when the communication cost is high. Finally, we draw analogies from well-studied biological systems and compare this framework to that of lateral gene transfer, a significant process of adaptation and evolution in novel environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often plagued by high failure rates. To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high).</p>

<p>Abstract: Building precise simulations of the real world and invoking numerical solvers to answer quantitative problems is an essential requirement in engineering and science. We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics, mathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\circledR$, an FEA software, to compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped with the ability to interact with the software through its Application Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex problems in the real world.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gleb Rodionov, Roman Garipov, Alina Shutova, George Yakushev, Vage Egiazarian, Anton Sinitsin, Denis Kuznedelev, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.</p>

Our findings reveal a preference for GPT-generated summaries over those from task-specific pre-trained models and reference summaries, highlighting GPT models' ability to follow human guidelines despite occasionally producing longer outputs and exhibiting divergent lexical and structural alignment with references.

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have used both automatic metrics and human evaluations to assess the simplification abilities of LLMs. However, the suitability of existing evaluation methodologies for LLMs remains in question. First, the suitability of current automatic metrics on LLMs' simplification evaluation is still uncertain. Second, current human evaluation approaches in sentence simplification often fall into two extremes: they are either too superficial, failing to offer a clear understanding of the models' performance, or overly detailed, making the annotation process complex and prone to inconsistency, which in turn affects the evaluation's reliability. To address these problems, this study provides in-depth insights into LLMs' performance while ensuring the reliability of the evaluation. We design an error-based human annotation framework to assess the LLMs' simplification capabilities. We select both closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama-3.2-3B. We believe that these models offer a representative selection across large, medium, and small sizes of LLMs. Results show that GPT-4 generally generates fewer erroneous simplification outputs compared to the current state-of-the-art. However, LLMs have their limitations, as seen in GPT-4's struggles with lexical paraphrasing. Results show that LLMs generally generate fewer erroneous simplification outputs compared to the previous state-of-the-art. However, LLMs have their limitations, as seen in GPT-4's and Qwen2.5-72B's struggle with lexical paraphrasing. Furthermore, we conduct meta-evaluations on widely used automatic metrics using our human annotations. We find that these metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to assess the overall high-quality simplifications, particularly those generated by high-performance LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is utilized in a wide range of fields, where words in text are typically transformed into feature vectors called embeddings. BioConceptVec is a specific example of embeddings tailored for biology, trained on approximately 30 million PubMed abstracts using models such as skip-gram. Generally, word embeddings are known to solve analogy tasks through simple vector arithmetic. For instance, $\mathrm{\textit{king}} - \mathrm{\textit{man}} + \mathrm{\textit{woman}}$ predicts $\mathrm{\textit{queen}}$. In this study, we demonstrate that BioConceptVec embeddings, along with our own embeddings trained on PubMed abstracts, contain information about drug-gene relations and can predict target genes from a given drug through analogy computations. We also show that categorizing drugs and genes using biological pathways improves performance. Furthermore, we illustrate that vectors derived from known relations in the past can predict unknown future relations in datasets divided by year. Despite the simplicity of implementing analogy tasks as vector additions, our approach demonstrated performance comparable to that of large language models such as GPT-4 in predicting drug-gene relations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Qu, Chenchen Ding, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding representation transfer in multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) can reveal the reason for the zero-shot translation deficiency. In this work, we systematically analyze the representational issue of MNMT models. We first introduce the identity pair, translating a sentence to itself, to address the lack of the base measure in multilingual investigations, as the identity pair can reflect the representation of a language within the model. Then, we demonstrate that the encoder transfers the source language to the representational subspace of the target language instead of the language-agnostic state. Thus, the zero-shot translation deficiency arises because the representation of a translation is entangled with other languages and not transferred to the target language effectively. Based on our findings, we propose two methods: 1) low-rank language-specific embedding at the encoder, and 2) language-specific contrastive learning of the representation at the decoder. The experimental results on Europarl-15, TED-19, and OPUS-100 datasets show that our methods substantially enhance the performance of zero-shot translations without sacrifices in supervised directions by improving language transfer capacity, thereby providing practical evidence to support our conclusions.

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) is crucial for enabling applications of symbolic knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to downstream tasks by projecting knowledge facts into vector spaces. Despite their effectiveness in modeling KG structural information, KRL methods are suffering from the sparseness of KGs. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the Transformer architecture presents promising opportunities for enhancing KRL by incorporating textual information to address information sparsity in KGs. LLM-enhanced KRL methods, including three key approaches, encoder-based methods that leverage detailed contextual information, encoder-decoder-based methods that utilize a unified Seq2Seq model for comprehensive encoding and decoding, and decoder-based methods that utilize extensive knowledge from large corpora, have significantly advanced the effectiveness and generalization of KRL in addressing a wide range of downstream tasks. This work provides a broad overview of downstream tasks while simultaneously identifying emerging research directions in these evolving domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyue Qin, Ziniu Hu, Zifan He, Neha Prakriya, Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet their inference processes are hindered by substantial time and energy demands due to single-token generation at each decoding step. While previous methods such as speculative decoding mitigate these inefficiencies by producing multiple tokens per step, each token is still generated by its single-token distribution, thereby enhancing speed without improving effectiveness. In contrast, our work simultaneously enhances inference speed and improves the output effectiveness. We consider multi-token joint decoding (MTJD), which generates multiple tokens from their joint distribution at each iteration, theoretically reducing perplexity and enhancing task performance. However, MTJD suffers from the high cost of sampling from the joint distribution of multiple tokens. Inspired by speculative decoding, we introduce multi-token assisted decoding (MTAD), a novel framework designed to accelerate MTJD. MTAD leverages a smaller auxiliary model to approximate the joint distribution of a larger model, incorporating a verification mechanism that not only ensures the accuracy of this approximation, but also improves the decoding efficiency over conventional speculative decoding. Theoretically, we demonstrate that MTAD closely approximates exact MTJD with bounded error. Empirical evaluations using Llama-2 and OPT models ranging from 13B to 70B parameters across various tasks reveal that MTAD reduces perplexity by 21.2% and improves downstream performance compared to standard single-token sampling. Furthermore, MTAD achieves a 1.42x speed-up and consumes 1.54x less energy than conventional speculative decoding methods. These results highlight MTAD's ability to make multi-token joint decoding both effective and efficient, promoting more sustainable and high-performance deployment of LLMs.</p>

Additionally, we present a study involving professional nutritionists, finding that LLMs can provide comparable but significantly faster estimates. Finally, we perform a real-world risk assessment by simulating the effect of carbohydrate predictions on the blood glucose levels of individuals with diabetes. Our work highlights the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation, demonstrating their potential to aid professionals and laypersons and improve health outcomes.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality instruction data for effective alignment, particularly in code generation tasks where expert curated datasets are expensive to produce. We present Genetic-Instruct, a scalable algorithm for synthesizing large-scale, high quality coding instructions using evolutionary principles. Starting from a small set of seed instructions, Genetic-Instruct generates diverse and challenging instruction-code pairs by leveraging an Instructor-LLM for generation, a Coder-LLM for code synthesis, and a Judge-LLM for automatic quality evaluation. Our proposed approach is highly parallelizable and effective even with a small seed data and weaker generator models. We generated more than 7.5 million coding instructions with the proposed approach. Then we evaluated it by fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic samples and demonstrated a significant improvement in their code generation capability compared to the other synthetic generation approaches and publicly available datasets. Our results highlight the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability of the Genetic-Instruct framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runtao Ren, Jian Ma, Jianxi Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: In traditional innovation practices, concept and IP generation are often iteratively integrated. Both processes demand an intricate understanding of advanced technical domain knowledge. Existing large language models (LLMs), while possessing massive pre-trained knowledge, often fall short in the innovative concept generation due to a lack of specialized knowledge necessary for the generation. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a novel knowledge finetuning (KFT) framework to endow LLM-based AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge and concepts for invention generation, i.e., concept and patent generation together. Our proposed PatentGPT integrates knowledge injection pre-training (KPT), domain-specific supervised finetuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Extensive evaluation shows that PatentGPT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on patent-related benchmark tests. Our method not only provides new insights into data-driven innovation but also paves a new path to fine-tune LLMs for applications in the context of technology. We also discuss the managerial and policy implications of AI-generating inventions in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Wu, Roman Yangarber, Xian Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation have revolutionized Information Extraction (IE). One such advancement is in Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE), a critical task in information systems that aims to extract entities and their semantic relationships from documents. However, existing methods are primarily designed for Sentence level Relation Triplet Extraction (SentRTE), which typically handles a limited set of relations and triplet facts within a single sentence. Additionally, some approaches treat relations as candidate choices integrated into prompt templates, resulting in inefficient processing and suboptimal performance when determining the relation elements in triplets. To address these limitations, we introduce a Discriminative and Voice Aware Paradigm DiVA. DiVA involves only two steps: performing document-level relation extraction (DocRE) and then identifying the subject object entities based on the relation. No additional processing is required simply input the document to directly obtain the triplets. This streamlined process more accurately reflects real-world scenarios for triplet extraction. Our innovation lies in transforming DocRE into a discriminative task, where the model pays attention to each relation and to the often overlooked issue of active vs. passive voice within the triplet. Our experiments on the Re-DocRED and DocRED datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results for the DocRTE task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratiksha Thaker, Shengyuan Hu, Neil Kale, Yash Maurya, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Virginia Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Unlearning methods have the potential to improve the privacy and safety of large language models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. The LLM unlearning research community has increasingly turned toward empirical benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of such methods. In this paper, we find that existing benchmarks provide an overly optimistic and potentially misleading view on the effectiveness of candidate unlearning methods. By introducing simple, benign modifications to a number of popular benchmarks, we expose instances where supposedly unlearned information remains accessible, or where the unlearning process has degraded the model's performance on retained information to a much greater extent than indicated by the original benchmark. We identify that existing benchmarks are particularly vulnerable to modifications that introduce even loose dependencies between the forget and retain information. Further, we show that ambiguity in unlearning targets in existing benchmarks can easily lead to the design of methods that overfit to the given test queries. Based on our findings, we urge the community to be cautious when interpreting benchmark results as reliable measures of progress, and we provide several recommendations to guide future LLM unlearning research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunhao Zheng, Juliette Decugis, Jonas Gehring, Taco Cohen, Benjamin Negrevergne, Gabriel Synnaeve</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought have established themselves as a popular vehicle for improving the outputs of large language models (LLMs). For code generation, however, their exact mechanics and efficacy are under-explored. We thus investigate the effects of a wide range of prompting strategies with a focus on automatic re-prompting over multiple turns and computational requirements. After systematically decomposing reasoning, instruction, and execution feedback prompts, we conduct an extensive grid search on the competitive programming benchmarks CodeContests and TACO for multiple LLM families and sizes (Llama 3.0 and 3.1, 8B, 70B, 405B, and GPT-4o). Our study reveals strategies that consistently improve performance across all models with small and large sampling budgets. We then show how finetuning with such an optimal configuration allows models to internalize the induced reasoning process and obtain improvements in performance and scalability for multi-turn code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangyi Chen, Binxuan Huang, Yifan Gao, Zhengyang Wang, Jingfeng Yang, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise estimation of downstream performance in large language models (LLMs) prior to training is essential for guiding their development process. Scaling laws analysis utilizes the statistics of a series of significantly smaller sampling language models (LMs) to predict the performance of the target LLM. For downstream performance prediction, the critical challenge lies in the emergent abilities in LLMs that occur beyond task-specific computational thresholds. In this work, we focus on the pre-training loss as a more computation-efficient metric for performance estimation. Our two-stage approach FLP consists of first estimating a function that maps computational resources (e.g., FLOPs) to the pre-training Loss using a series of fully-converged sampling models, followed by mapping the pre-training loss to downstream task Performance using the intermediate models with emerged performance. In our experiments, this FLP solution accurately predicts the performance of LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters using a series of sampling LMs up to 3B, achieving error margins of 5% and 10%, respectively, and significantly outperforming the FLOPs-to-Performance approach. Further, we present FLP-M, a fundamental approach for performance prediction that addresses the practical need to integrate datasets from multiple sources during pre-training. FLP-M extends the power law analytical function to predict domain-specific pre-training loss based on FLOPs across data sources, and employs a two-layer neural network to model the non-linear relationship between multiple domain-specific loss and downstream performance. By utilizing a 3B LLM trained on a specific ratio and a series of smaller sampling LMs, FLP-M can effectively forecast the performance of 3B and 7B LLMs across various data mixtures for most benchmarks within 10% error margins.</p>

<p>Abstract: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyuan Shi, Zexin Lu, Xiaoyu Dong, Wenlong Zhang, Xuanyu Zhang, Yujie Feng, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) through supervised fine-tuning is essential for tailoring them to specific applications. Recent studies suggest that alignment primarily adjusts a model's presentation style rather than its foundational knowledge, indicating that only certain components of the model are significantly impacted. To uncover how alignment affects model behavior at a granular level, we propose identifying which layers within LLMs are most critical to the alignment process. Our approach, named ILA, involves learning a binary mask for the parameter changes in each layer during alignment, as an indicator of layer significance. Experimental results reveal that, despite substantial differences in alignment datasets, the important layers of a model identified by ILA exhibit nearly 90\% overlap, highlighting fundamental patterns in LLM alignment. The results also indicate that freezing non-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively tuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency with minimal performance loss. Finally, we discuss how these findings extend from LLM alignment to reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Zuo, Wenxuan Jiang, Wenxuan Liu, Zixuan Li, Long Bai, Hanbin Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaolong Jin, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical evidence indicates that LLMs exhibit spontaneous cross-lingual alignment. However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in IE, a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal information extraction. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability through IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on a translated instance prediction task we proposed. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by $30.17\%$ and SoTA by $20.03\%$, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

In architecture design, Fox-1 features a deeper layer structure, an expanded vocabulary, and utilizes Grouped Query Attention (GQA), offering a performant and efficient architecture compared to other SLMs. Fox-1 achieves better or on-par performance in various benchmarks compared to StableLM-2-1.6B, Gemma-2B, Qwen1.5-1.8B, and OpenELM1.1B, with competitive inference speed and throughput.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Zhang, Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Alexander Fabbri, Gabriel Bernadett-Shapiro, Rui Zhang, Prasenjit Mitra, Caiming Xiong, Chien-Sheng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Indexing is an important step towards strong performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, existing methods organize data based on either semantic similarity (similarity) or related information (relatedness), but do not cover both perspectives comprehensively. Our analysis reveals that modeling only one perspective results in insufficient knowledge synthesis, leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks requiring multihop reasoning. In this paper, we propose SiReRAG, a novel RAG indexing approach that explicitly considers both similar and related information. On the similarity side, we follow existing work and explore some variances to construct a similarity tree based on recursive summarization. On the relatedness side, SiReRAG extracts propositions and entities from texts, groups propositions via shared entities, and generates recursive summaries to construct a relatedness tree. We index and flatten both similarity and relatedness trees into a unified retrieval pool. Our experiments demonstrate that SiReRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on three multihop datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA), with an average 1.9% improvement in F1 scores. As a reasonably efficient solution, SiReRAG enhances existing reranking methods significantly, with up to 7.8% improvement in average F1 scores.

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text-to-SQL systems. However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q&A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their superior performance in many knowledge-driven applications on the world wide web.These models are designed to train hundreds of millions or more parameters on large amounts of text data, enabling them to understand and generate naturallanguage effectively. As the superior performance of LLMs becomes apparent,they are increasingly being applied to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) related tasks to improve the processing results. Traditional KGE representation learning methods map entities and relations into a low-dimensional vector space, enablingthe triples in the knowledge graph to satisfy a specific scoring function in thevector space. However, based on the powerful language understanding and seman-tic modeling capabilities of LLMs, that have recently been invoked to varying degrees in different types of KGE related scenarios such as multi-modal KGE andopen KGE according to their task characteristics. In this paper, we investigate awide range of approaches for performing LLMs-related tasks in different types of KGE scenarios. To better compare the various approaches, we summarize each KGE scenario in a classification. Finally, we discuss the applications in which the methods are mainly used and suggest several forward-looking directions for the development of this new research area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Wang, Bin Bi, Yanqi Luo, Sitaram Asur, Claire Na Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the challenge of context window limitations, primarily due to the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism (\(O(N^2)\), where \(N\) denotes the context window length). This constraint impacts tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (Q\&A) and long context summarization. A common approach involves selecting content with the highest similarity to the query; however, this often leads to redundancy and the exclusion of diverse yet relevant information. Building on principles from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), we integrate diversity into the content selection process. Our findings reveal that incorporating diversity substantially increases the recall of selecting relevant sentences or chunks before LLM-based Q\&A and summarization. These results highlight the importance of maintaining diversity in future LLM applications to further improve summarization and Q\&A outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Ren, Qi Chen, Lingqiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) typically relies on producing large sets of input-output pairs. Yet for a given question, there can be many valid outputs. In practice, these outputs are often derived by distilling knowledge from teacher models, and they can vary depending on the specific teacher model or prompting strategy employed. Recent findings show that how these training outputs are generated can significantly affect the performance of the fine-tuned model, raising an important question: how do we pick the best data generation method from among numerous possibilities? Rather than exhaustively training and evaluating on each candidate, this paper proposes a scalable approximate method that assesses a small subset of generated data to estimate its suitability for a specific target LLM. Our central idea is that effective outputs should be familiar to the target LLM. While previous work measures familiarity with perplexity, we find that perplexity might be suboptimal in characterizing 'familiarity' through theoretical analysis and practical observations. To address this, we introduce self-aligned perplexity, a novel metric capturing how closely candidate outputs adhere to the target LLM's own style and reasoning patterns. In this way, we can identify the most effective generation strategy on a small sample, then apply it to produce the complete training set. We demonstrate that training on data generated by the chosen method yields significant improvements across diverse reasoning-focused benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse linguistic settings remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages. Existing safety alignment methods are English-centric, limiting their effectiveness. We systematically compare Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) for aligning SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct, a Llama 3-8B variant, to reduce toxicity in Singlish. Our results show that SFT+KTO achieves superior safety alignment with higher sample efficiency than DPO. Additionally, we introduce KTO-S, which enhances stability via improved KL divergence regularization. Our approach reduces Singlish toxicity by 99\%, generalizes to TOXIGEN, and maintains strong performance on standard LLM benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for safer AI deployment in multilingual contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean Wang, Yicheng Jiang, Yuxin Tang, Lu Cheng, Hanjie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for assessing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), as it reveals confidence in predictions, identifies failure modes, and gauges output reliability. Conformal Prediction (CP), a model-agnostic method that generates prediction sets with a specified error rate, has been adopted for UQ in classification tasks, where the size of the prediction set indicates the model's uncertainty. However, when adapting CP to NLG, the sampling-based method for generating candidate outputs cannot guarantee the inclusion of the ground truth, limiting its applicability across a wide range of error rates. To address this, we propose \ourmethod, a method that explicitly adds the ground truth to the candidate outputs and uses logit scores to measure nonconformity. Our experiments with six LLMs on four NLG tasks show that \ourmethod outperforms baseline methods in calibrating error rates and empirical cover rates, offering accurate UQ across a wide range of user-specified error rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text embeddings are typically evaluated on a limited set of tasks, which are constrained by language, domain, and task diversity. To address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) - a large-scale, community-driven expansion of MTEB, covering over 500 quality-controlled evaluation tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes a diverse set of challenging, novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval, representing the largest multilingual collection of evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. Using this collection, we develop several highly multilingual benchmarks, which we use to evaluate a representative set of models. We find that while large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain language subsets and task categories, the best-performing publicly available model is multilingual-e5-large-instruct with only 560 million parameters. To facilitate accessibility and reduce computational cost, we introduce a novel downsampling method based on inter-task correlation, ensuring a diverse selection while preserving relative model rankings. Furthermore, we optimize tasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but effective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks that drastically reduce computational demands. For instance, our newly introduced zero-shot English benchmark maintains a ranking order similar to the full-scale version but at a fraction of the computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> DongGeon Lee, Hwanjo Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs severely limit their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering. To address this challenge, we introduce REFIND (Retrieval-augmented Factuality hallucINation Detection), a novel framework that detects hallucinated spans within LLM outputs by directly leveraging retrieved documents. As part of the REFIND, we propose the Context Sensitivity Ratio (CSR), a novel metric that quantifies the sensitivity of LLM outputs to retrieved evidence. This innovative approach enables REFIND to efficiently and accurately detect hallucinations, setting it apart from existing methods. In the evaluation, REFIND demonstrated robustness across nine languages, including low-resource settings, and significantly outperformed baseline models, achieving superior IoU scores in identifying hallucinated spans. This work highlights the effectiveness of quantifying context sensitivity for hallucination detection, thereby paving the way for more reliable and trustworthy LLM applications across diverse languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lihu Chen, Shuojie Fu, Gabriel Freedman, Cemre Zor, Guy Martin, James Kinross, Uddhav Vaghela, Ovidiu Serban, Francesca Toni</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant and growing number of published scientific articles is found to involve fraudulent practices, posing a serious threat to the credibility and safety of research in fields such as medicine. We propose Pub-Guard-LLM, the first large language model-based system tailored to fraud detection of biomedical scientific articles. We provide three application modes for deploying Pub-Guard-LLM: vanilla reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent debate. Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions. To assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark, PubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles, including metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ru Peng, Kexin Yang, Yawen Zeng, Junyang Lin, Dayiheng Liu, Junbo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, we are inspired by ``reverse thinking'' -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. In this paper, we train a Data Manager (DataMan) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the Overall Score l=5 surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of LLMs presents significant challenges to their transparency and interpretability, necessitating the use of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance trustworthiness and usability. This study introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework with four novel metrics for assessing the effectiveness of five XAI techniques across five LLMs and two downstream tasks. We apply this framework to evaluate several XAI techniques LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and Attention Mechanism Visualization (AMV) using the IMDB Movie Reviews and Tweet Sentiment Extraction datasets. The evaluation focuses on four key metrics: Human-reasoning Agreement (HA), Robustness, Consistency, and Contrastivity. Our results show that LIME consistently achieves high scores across multiple LLMs and evaluation metrics, while AMV demonstrates superior Robustness and near-perfect Consistency. LRP excels in Contrastivity, particularly with more complex models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different XAI methods, offering guidance for developing and selecting appropriate XAI techniques for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jin, Hansi Zeng, Zhenrui Yue, Jinsung Yoon, Sercan Arik, Dong Wang, Hamed Zamani, Jiawei Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marta Adamska, Daria Smirnova, Hamid Nasiri, Zhengxin Yu, Peter Garraghan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across various domains spanning search engines, code generation, and text creation. However, a major concern associated with their adoption is the high cost of inference, impacting both their sustainability and financial feasibility. In this study, we empirically study how different prompt and response characteristics directly impact LLM inference energy cost. We conduct experiments leveraging three open-source transformer-based LLMs across three task types$-$question answering, sentiment analysis, and text generation. For each inference, we analyzed prompt and response characteristics (length, semantic meaning, time taken, energy consumption). Our results demonstrate that even when presented with identical tasks, models generate responses with varying characteristics and subsequently exhibit distinct energy consumption patterns. We found that prompt length is less significant than the semantic meaning of the task itself. In addition, we identified specific keywords associated with higher or lower energy usage that vary between associated tasks. These findings highlight the importance of prompt design in optimizing inference efficiency. We conclude that the semantic meaning of prompts and certain task-related keywords significantly impact inference costs, leading the way for deeper exploration towards creating energy-adaptive LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea W Wen-Yi, Unso Eun Seo Jo, David Mimno</p>
<p>Abstract: The release of top-performing open-weight LLMs has cemented China's role as a leading force in AI development. Do these models support languages spoken in China? Or do they speak the same languages as Western models? Comparing multilingual capabilities is important for two reasons. First, language ability provides insights into pre-training data curation, and thus into resource allocation and development priorities. Second, China has a long history of explicit language policy, varying between inclusivity of minority languages and a Mandarin-first policy. To test whether Chinese LLMs today reflect an agenda about China's languages, we test performance of Chinese and Western open-source LLMs on Asian regional and Chinese minority languages. Our experiments on Information Parity and reading comprehension show Chinese models' performance across these languages correlates strongly (r=0.93) with Western models', with the sole exception being better Mandarin. Sometimes, Chinese models cannot identify languages spoken by Chinese minorities such as Kazakh and Uyghur, even though they are good at French and German. These results provide a window into current development priorities, suggest options for future development, and indicate guidance for end users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jirui Qi, Raquel Fern\'andez, Arianna Bisazza</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong performance in multilingual question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging relevant passages retrieved from corpora. In multilingual RAG (mRAG), the retrieved passages can be written in languages other than that of the query entered by the user, making it challenging for LLMs to effectively utilize the provided information. Recent research suggests that retrieving passages from multilingual corpora can improve RAG performance, particularly for low-resource languages. However, the extent to which LLMs can leverage different kinds of multilingual contexts to generate accurate answers, *independently from retrieval quality*, remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of a relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected language, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple `distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our experiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48 languages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant information from out-language passages, but a much weaker ability to formulate a full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and feature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages negatively impact answer quality regardless of their language. However, distractors in the query language exert a slightly stronger influence. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of how LLMs utilize context in mRAG systems, providing directions for future improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Long Lu, Chunhui Zhang, Jiajun Song, Lifeng Fan, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), applied during the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced their capabilities in structured reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logical inference. However, the effectiveness of RL in social reasoning, particularly in Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' mental states, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that RL methods effectively unlock ToM reasoning capabilities even in small-scale LLMs (0.5B to 7B parameters). Using a modest dataset comprising 3200 questions across diverse scenarios, our RL-trained 7B model achieves 84.50\% accuracy on the Hi-ToM benchmark, surpassing models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-v3 despite significantly fewer parameters. While smaller models ($\leq$3B parameters) suffer from reasoning collapse, larger models (7B parameters) maintain stable performance through consistent belief tracking. Additionally, our RL-based models demonstrate robust generalization to higher-order, out-of-distribution ToM problems, novel textual presentations, and previously unseen datasets. These findings highlight RL's potential to enhance social cognitive reasoning, bridging the gap between structured problem-solving and nuanced social inference in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuanqi Cheng, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form video processing fundamentally challenges vision-language models (VLMs) due to the high computational costs of handling extended temporal sequences. Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLaMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at ``mixed precision'' through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLaMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLaMP's superior performance across four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLaMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source both the synthetic data collected and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

<p>Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about concerns regarding copyright infringement and unethical practices in data and model usage. For instance, slight modifications to existing LLMs may be used to falsely claim the development of new models, leading to issues of model copying and violations of ownership rights. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel metric for quantifying LLM similarity, which leverages perplexity curves and differences in Menger curvature. Comprehensive experiments validate the performance of our methodology, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods and its ability to generalize across diverse models and domains. Furthermore, we highlight the capability of our approach in detecting model replication through simulations, emphasizing its potential to preserve the originality and integrity of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/zyttt-coder/LLM_similarity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Case 03 of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), focused on the so-called false positives in Colombia, represents one of the most harrowing episodes of the Colombian armed conflict. This article proposes an innovative methodology based on natural language analysis and semantic co-occurrence models to explore, systematize, and visualize narrative patterns present in the public hearings of victims and appearing parties. By constructing skipgram networks and analyzing their modularity, the study identifies thematic clusters that reveal regional and procedural status differences, providing empirical evidence on dynamics of victimization, responsibility, and acknowledgment in this case. This computational approach contributes to the collective construction of both judicial and extrajudicial truth, offering replicable tools for other transitional justice cases.

<p>Abstract: As language models achieve increasingly human-like capabilities in conversational text generation, a critical question emerges: to what extent can these systems simulate the characteristics of specific individuals? To evaluate this, we introduce IMPersona, a framework for evaluating LMs at impersonating specific individuals' writing style and personal knowledge. Using supervised fine-tuning and a hierarchical memory-inspired retrieval system, we demonstrate that even modestly sized open-source models, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can achieve impersonation abilities at concerning levels. In blind conversation experiments, participants (mis)identified our fine-tuned models with memory integration as human in 44.44% of interactions, compared to just 25.00% for the best prompting-based approach. We analyze these results to propose detection methods and defense strategies against such impersonation attempts. Our findings raise important questions about both the potential applications and risks of personalized language models, particularly regarding privacy, security, and the ethical deployment of such technologies in real-world contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized their ability to handle single-turn tasks, yet real-world applications demand sophisticated multi-turn interactions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available at https://github.com/yubol-cmu/Awesome-Multi-Turn-LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aravind Krishnan, Siva Reddy, Marius Mosbach</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned from particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on standard benchmarks, yet they struggle increasingly from mode collapse, the inability to generate diverse and novel outputs. Our work introduces NoveltyBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of language models to produce multiple distinct and high-quality outputs. NoveltyBench utilizes prompts curated to elicit diverse answers and filtered real-world user queries. Evaluating 20 leading language models, we find that current state-of-the-art systems generate significantly less diversity than human writers. Notably, larger models within a family often exhibit less diversity than their smaller counterparts, challenging the notion that capability on standard benchmarks translates directly to generative utility. While prompting strategies like in-context regeneration can elicit diversity, our findings highlight a fundamental lack of distributional diversity in current models, reducing their utility for users seeking varied responses and suggesting the need for new training and evaluation paradigms that prioritize diversity alongside quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivica Kostric, Krisztian Balog, Filip Radlinski</p>
<p>Abstract: A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over traditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences using natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference elicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. Users searching for recommendations may not have deep knowledge of the available options in a given domain. As such, they might not be aware of key attributes or desirable values for them. However, in many settings, talking about the planned use of items does not present any difficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions based on item usage. As one of the main contributions of this work, we develop a multi-stage data annotation protocol using crowdsourcing, to create a high-quality labeled training dataset. Another main contribution is the development of four models for the question generation task: two template-based baseline models and two neural text-to-text models. The template-based models use heuristically extracted common patterns found in the training data, while the neural models use the training data to learn to generate questions automatically. Using common metrics from machine translation for automatic evaluation, we show that our approaches are effective in generating elicitation questions, even with limited training data. We further employ human evaluation for comparing the generated questions using both pointwise and pairwise evaluation designs. We find that the human evaluation results are consistent with the automatic ones, allowing us to draw conclusions about the quality of the generated questions with certainty. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of cases where the models show their limitations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Vashishtha, Abbavaram Gowtham Reddy, Abhinav Kumar, Saketh Bachu, Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Amit Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used as experts to infer causal graphs, often by repeatedly applying a pairwise prompt that asks about the causal relationship of each variable pair. However, such experts, including human domain experts, cannot distinguish between direct and indirect effects given a pairwise prompt. Therefore, instead of the graph, we propose that causal order be used as a more stable output interface for utilizing expert knowledge. Even when querying a perfect expert with a pairwise prompt, we show that the inferred graph can have significant errors whereas the causal order is always correct. In practice, however, LLMs are imperfect experts and we find that pairwise prompts lead to multiple cycles. Hence, we propose the triplet method, a novel querying strategy that introduces an auxiliary variable for every variable pair and instructs the LLM to avoid cycles within this triplet. It then uses a voting-based ensemble method that results in higher accuracy and fewer cycles while ensuring cost efficiency. Across multiple real-world graphs, such a triplet-based method yields a more accurate order than the pairwise prompt, using both LLMs and human annotators. The triplet method enhances robustness by repeatedly querying an expert with different auxiliary variables, enabling smaller models like Phi-3 and Llama-3 8B Instruct to surpass GPT-4 with pairwise prompting. For practical usage, we show how the expert-provided causal order from the triplet method can be used to reduce error in downstream graph discovery and effect inference tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chantal Pellegrini, Ege \"Ozsoy, Benjamin Busam, Nassir Navab, Matthias Keicher</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational AI tools that can generate and discuss clinically correct radiology reports for a given medical image have the potential to transform radiology. Such a human-in-the-loop radiology assistant could facilitate a collaborative diagnostic process, thus saving time and improving the quality of reports. Towards this goal, we introduce RaDialog, the first thoroughly evaluated and publicly available large vision-language model for radiology report generation and interactive dialog. RaDialog effectively integrates visual image features and structured pathology findings with a large language model (LLM) while simultaneously adapting it to a specialized domain using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To keep the conversational abilities of the underlying LLM, we propose a comprehensive, semi-automatically labeled, image-grounded instruct dataset for chest X-ray radiology tasks. By training with this dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art clinical correctness in report generation and shows impressive abilities in interactive tasks such as correcting reports and answering questions, serving as a foundational step toward clinical dialog systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiyuan Liu, Hang Guo, Tao Dai, Naiqi Li, Jigang Bao, Xudong Ren, Yong Jiang, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Hank0626/LLaTA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code are rapidly evolving, with code editing emerging as a critical capability. We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chujie Zheng, Ziqi Wang, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoshitaka Inoue, Tianci Song, Xinling Wang, Augustin Luna, Tianfan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) allow them to address diverse questions using human-like interfaces. Still, limitations in their training prevent them from answering accurately in scenarios that could benefit from multiple perspectives. Multi-agent systems allow the resolution of questions to enhance result consistency and reliability. While drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is important for drug discovery, existing approaches face challenges due to complex biological systems and the lack of interpretability needed for clinical applications. DrugAgent is a multi-agent LLM system for DTI prediction that combines multiple specialized perspectives with transparent reasoning. Our system adapts and extends existing multi-agent frameworks by (1) applying coordinator-based architecture to the DTI domain, (2) integrating domain-specific data sources, including ML predictions, knowledge graphs, and literature evidence, and (3) incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct (Reason+Act) frameworks for transparent DTI reasoning. We conducted comprehensive experiments using a kinase inhibitor dataset, where our multi-agent LLM method outperformed the non-reasoning multi-agent model (GPT-4o mini) by 45% in F1 score (0.514 vs 0.355). Through ablation studies, we demonstrated the contributions of each agent, with the AI agent being the most impactful, followed by the KG agent and search agent. Most importantly, our approach provides detailed, human-interpretable reasoning for each prediction by combining evidence from multiple sources - a critical feature for biomedical applications where understanding the rationale behind predictions is essential for clinical decision-making and regulatory compliance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Zhang, Philip H. S. Torr, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Adel Bibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on human preferences, typically through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has proven successful in enhancing their capabilities. However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture the global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark that includes comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO achieves the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor with less than 10\% of the computational resources and human prompting and annotation process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Zhou, You Zhang, Shengkui Zhao, Hao Wang, Zexu Pan, Dianwen Ng, Chong Zhang, Chongjia Ni, Yukun Ma, Trung Hieu Nguyen, Jia Qi Yip, Bin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Current emotional text-to-speech systems face challenges in conveying the full spectrum of human emotions, largely due to the inherent complexity of human emotions and the limited range of emotional labels in existing speech datasets. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a TTS framework that provides flexible user control over three emotional dimensions - pleasure, arousal, and dominance - enabling the synthesis of a diverse array of emotional styles. The framework leverages an emotional dimension predictor, trained soley on categorical labels from speech data and grounded in earlier psychological research, which is seamlessly integrated into a language model-based TTS system. Experimental results demonstrates that the proposed framework effectively learns emotional styles from expressive speech, eliminating the need for explicit emotion labels during TTS training, while enhancing the naturalness and diversity of synthesized emotional speech.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents, tackling tasks from robotics to web navigation. Their performance depends on the underlying base agent. Existing methods, however, struggle with long-context reasoning and goal adherence. We introduce StateAct, a novel and efficient base agent that enhances decision-making through (1) self-prompting, which reinforces task goals at every step, and (2) chain-of-states, an extension of chain-of-thought that tracks state information over time. StateAct outperforms ReAct, the previous best base agent, by over 10% on Alfworld, 30% on Textcraft, and 7% on Webshop across multiple frontier LLMs. We also demonstrate that StateAct can be used as a drop-in replacement for ReAct with advanced LLM agent methods such as test-time scaling, yielding an additional 12% gain on Textcraft. By improving efficiency and long-range reasoning without requiring additional training or retrieval, StateAct provides a scalable foundation for LLM agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Oscar Yin, Alexander M. Rush</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. For compute-optimal training, we find that perplexity and gradient data selection require training-to-selection model size ratios of 5x and 10x, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lam Nguyen Tung, Steven Cho, Xiaoning Du, Neelofar Neelofar, Valerio Terragni, Stefano Ruberto, Aldeida Aleti</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) for text classification has been widely used in various domains. These applications can significantly impact ethics, economics, and human behavior, raising serious concerns about trusting ML decisions. Studies indicate that conventional metrics are insufficient to build human trust in ML models. These models often learn spurious correlations and predict based on them. In the real world, their performance can deteriorate significantly. To avoid this, a common practice is to test whether predictions are reasonable based on valid patterns in the data. Along with this, a challenge known as the trustworthiness oracle problem has been introduced. Due to the lack of automated trustworthiness oracles, the assessment requires manual validation of the decision process disclosed by explanation methods. However, this is time-consuming, error-prone, and unscalable.
  We propose TOKI, the first automated trustworthiness oracle generation method for text classifiers. TOKI automatically checks whether the words contributing the most to a prediction are semantically related to the predicted class. Specifically, we leverage ML explanations to extract the decision-contributing words and measure their semantic relatedness with the class based on word embeddings. We also introduce a novel adversarial attack method that targets trustworthiness vulnerabilities identified by TOKI. To evaluate their alignment with human judgement, experiments are conducted. We compare TOKI with a naive baseline based solely on model confidence and TOKI-guided adversarial attack method with A2T, a SOTA adversarial attack method. Results show that relying on prediction uncertainty cannot effectively distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy predictions, TOKI achieves 142% higher accuracy than the naive baseline, and TOKI-guided attack method is more effective with fewer perturbations than A2T.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fu-Chieh Chang, You-Chen Lin, Pei-Yuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, allowing models to solve complex tasks stepwise. However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical capabilities, largely driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes complex reasoning into step-by-step solutions. However, the mechanisms underlying LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic in a single step of CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose that LLMs learn arithmetic by capturing algebraic structures, such as commutativity and identity properties. Since these structures are observable through input-output relationships, they can generalize to unseen data. We empirically demonstrate that LLMs can learn algebraic structures using a custom dataset of arithmetic problems, as well as providing theoretical evidence showing that, under specific configurations of weights and biases, the transformer-based LLMs can generate embeddings that remain invariant to both permutations of input tokens and the presence of identity elements. Our findings indicate that leveraging algebraic structures can enhance the LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, offering insights into improving their arithmetic performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This perspective article aims at providing an outline of the state of the art and future developments towards the integration of cutting-edge predictive language models with BCI. A synthetic overview of early and more recent linguistic models, from natural language processing (NLP) models to recent LLM, that to a varying extent improved predictive writing systems, is first provided. Second, a summary of previous BCI implementations integrating language models is presented. The few preliminary studies investigating the possible combination of LLM with BCI spellers to efficiently support fast communication and control are then described. Finally, current challenges and limitations towards the full integration of LLM with BCI systems are discussed. Recent investigations suggest that the combination of LLM with BCI might drastically improve human-computer interaction in patients with motor or language disorders as well as in healthy individuals. In particular, the pretrained autoregressive transformer models, such as GPT, that capitalize from parallelization, learning through pre-training and fine-tuning, promise a substantial improvement of BCI for communication with respect to previous systems incorporating simpler language models. Indeed, among various models, the GPT-2 was shown to represent an excellent candidate for its integration into BCI although testing was only perfomed on simulated conversations and not on real BCI scenarios. Prospectively, the full integration of LLM with advanced BCI systems might lead to a big leap forward towards fast, efficient and user-adaptive neurotechnology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyun Zhao, Hongyi Yuan, Jingjing Liu, Haichao Chen, Huaiyuan Ying, Songchi Zhou, Yue Zhong, Sheng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) retrieval plays a pivotal role in various clinical tasks, but its development has been severely impeded by the lack of publicly available benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a novel public EHR retrieval benchmark, CliniQ, to address this gap. We consider two retrieval settings: Single-Patient Retrieval and Multi-Patient Retrieval, reflecting various real-world scenarios. Single-Patient Retrieval focuses on finding relevant parts within a patient note, while Multi-Patient Retrieval involves retrieving EHRs from multiple patients. We build our benchmark upon 1,000 discharge summary notes along with the ICD codes and prescription labels from MIMIC-III, and collect 1,246 unique queries with 77,206 relevance judgments by further leveraging powerful LLMs as annotators. Additionally, we include a novel assessment of the semantic gap issue in EHR retrieval by categorizing matching types into string match and four types of semantic matches. On our proposed benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various retrieval methods, ranging from conventional exact match to popular dense retrievers. Our experiments find that BM25 sets a strong baseline and performs competitively to the dense retrievers, and general domain dense retrievers surprisingly outperform those designed for the medical domain. In-depth analyses on various matching types reveal the strengths and drawbacks of different methods, enlightening the potential for targeted improvement. We believe that our benchmark will stimulate the research communities to advance EHR retrieval systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdelrahman Abdallah, Bhawna Piryani, Jonas Wallat, Avishek Anand, Adam Jatowt</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal awareness is crucial in many information retrieval tasks, particularly in scenarios where the relevance of documents depends on their alignment with the query's temporal context. Traditional approaches such as BM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) focus on lexical or semantic similarity but tend to neglect the temporal alignment between queries and documents, which is essential for time-sensitive tasks like temporal question answering (TQA). We propose TempRetriever, a novel extension of DPR that explicitly incorporates temporal information by embedding both the query date and document timestamp into the retrieval process. This allows retrieving passages that are not only contextually relevant but also aligned with the temporal intent of queries. We evaluate TempRetriever on two large-scale datasets ArchivalQA and ChroniclingAmericaQA demonstrating its superiority over baseline retrieval models across multiple metrics. TempRetriever achieves a 6.63\% improvement in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and a 3.79\% improvement in NDCG@10 compared to the standard DPR on ArchivalQA. Similarly, for ChroniclingAmericaQA, TempRetriever exhibits a 9.56\% improvement in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and a 4.68\% improvement in NDCG@10. We also propose a novel, time-based negative sampling strategy which further enhances retrieval performance by addressing temporal misalignment during training. Our results underline the importance of temporal aspects in dense retrieval systems and establish a new benchmark for time-aware passage retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the recent success of image-text contrastive models like CLIP and SigLIP, these models often struggle with vision-centric tasks that demand high-fidelity image understanding, such as counting, depth estimation, and fine-grained object recognition. These models, by performing language alignment, tend to prioritize high-level semantics over visual understanding, weakening their image understanding. On the other hand, vision-focused models are great at processing visual information but struggle to understand language, limiting their flexibility for language-driven tasks. In this work, we introduce TULIP, an open-source, drop-in replacement for existing CLIP-like models. Our method leverages generative data augmentation, enhanced image-image and text-text contrastive learning, and image/text reconstruction regularization to learn fine-grained visual features while preserving global semantic alignment. Our approach, scaling to over 1B parameters, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple benchmarks, establishing a new SOTA zero-shot performance on ImageNet-1K, delivering up to a $2\times$ enhancement over SigLIP on RxRx1 in linear probing for few-shot classification, and improving vision-language models, achieving over $3\times$ higher scores than SigLIP on MMVP.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yan, Yufei Xu, Zhengyin Du, Xuesong Yao, Zheyu Wang, Xiaowen Guo, Jiecao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid escalation from elementary school-level to frontier problems of the difficulty for LLM benchmarks in recent years have weaved a miracle for researchers that we are only inches away from surpassing human intelligence. However, is the LLMs' remarkable reasoning ability indeed comes from true intelligence by human standards, or are they simply reciting solutions witnessed during training at an Internet level? To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark. Surprisingly, we found existing cutting-edge LLMs unanimously exhibits extremely severe recitation behavior; by changing one phrase in the condition, top models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 can suffer $60\%$ performance loss on elementary school-level arithmetic and reasoning problems. Such findings are a wake-up call to the LLM community that compels us to re-evaluate the true intelligence level of cutting-edge LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binh M. Le, Shaoyuan Xu, Jinmiao Fu, Zhishen Huang, Moyan Li, Yanhui Guo, Hongdong Li, Sameera Ramasinghe, Bryan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In Visual Document Understanding (VDU) tasks, fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) with new datasets often falls short in optimizing the vision encoder to identify query-specific regions in text-rich document images. Existing methods that directly inject queries into model layers by modifying the network architecture often struggle to adapt to new datasets with limited annotations. To address this, we introduce QID, a novel, streamlined, architecture-preserving approach that integrates query embeddings into the vision encoder, leading to notable performance gains, particularly in data-scarce fine-tuning scenarios. Specifically, our approach introduces a dual-module framework: a query-aware module that generates a unique query vector to precisely guide the model's focus, as well as a query-agnostic module that captures the positional relationships among tokens, ensuring robust spatial understanding. Notably, both modules operate independently of the vision attention blocks, facilitating targeted learning of query embeddings and enhancing visual semantic identification. Experiments with OCR-free VLMs across multiple datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements using our method, especially in handling text-rich documents in data-scarce environments.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03814">Recursive Training Loops in LLMs: How training data properties modulate distribution shift in generated data?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Grgur Kova\v{c}, J\'er\'emy Perez, R\'emy Portelas, Peter Ford Dominey, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly contributing to the creation of content on the Internet. This creates a feedback loop as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this generated, synthetic data. This phenomenon is receiving increasing interest, in particular because previous studies have shown that it may lead to distribution shift - models misrepresent and forget the true underlying distributions of human data they are expected to approximate (e.g. resulting in a drastic loss of quality). In this study, we study the impact of human data properties on distribution shift dynamics in iterated training loops. We first confirm that the distribution shift dynamics greatly vary depending on the human data by comparing four datasets (two based on Twitter and two on Reddit). We then test whether data quality may influence the rate of this shift. We find that it does on the twitter, but not on the Reddit datasets. We then focus on a Reddit dataset and conduct a more exhaustive evaluation of a large set of dataset properties. This experiment associated lexical diversity with larger, and semantic diversity with smaller detrimental shifts, suggesting that incorporating text with high lexical (but limited semantic) diversity could exacerbate the degradation of generated text. We then focus on the evolution of political bias, and find that the type of shift observed (bias reduction, amplification or inversion) depends on the political lean of the human (true) distribution. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on the consequences of recursive fine-tuning by showing that this phenomenon is highly dependent on features of the human data on which training occurs. This suggests that different parts of internet (e.g. GitHub, Reddit) may undergo different types of shift depending on their properties.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220">Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p>
