<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Shi, Zhuofu Tao, Yuhao Gao, Tianjia Zhou, Cheng Chang, Yaxing Wang, Bingyu Chen, Genhao Zhang, Alvin Liu, Zhiping Yu, Ting-Jung Lin, Lei He</p>
<p>Abstract: High-performance analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuits are mainly full-custom designed, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. A significant portion of the effort is experience-driven, which makes the automation of AMS circuit design a formidable challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications, fostering advancements in the automatic design process for large-scale AMS circuits. However, the absence of high-quality datasets has led to issues such as model hallucination, which undermines the robustness of automatically generated circuit designs. To address this issue, this paper introduces AMSnet-KG, a dataset encompassing various AMS circuit schematics and netlists. We construct a knowledge graph with annotations on detailed functional and performance characteristics. Facilitated by AMSnet-KG, we propose an automated AMS circuit generation framework that utilizes the comprehensive knowledge embedded in LLMs. We first formulate a design strategy (e.g., circuit architecture using a number of circuit components) based on required specifications. Next, matched circuit components are retrieved and assembled into a complete topology, and transistor sizing is obtained through Bayesian optimization. Simulation results of the netlist are fed back to the LLM for further topology refinement, ensuring the circuit design specifications are met. We perform case studies of operational amplifier and comparator design to verify the automatic design flow from specifications to netlists with minimal human effort. The dataset used in this paper will be open-sourced upon publishing of this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Urtzi Otamendi, Mikel Maiza, Igor G. Olaizola, Basilio Sierra, Markel Flores, Marco Quartulli</p>
<p>Abstract: Managing resources effectively in uncertain demand, variable availability, and complex governance policies is a significant challenge. This paper presents a paradigmatic framework for addressing these issues in water management scenarios by integrating advanced physical modelling, remote sensing techniques, and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. The proposed approach accurately predicts water availability, estimates demand, and optimizes resource allocation on both short- and long-term basis, combining a comprehensive hydrological model, agronomic crop models for precise demand estimation, and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming for efficient resource distribution. In the study case of the Segura Hydrographic Basin, the approach successfully allocated approximately 642 million cubic meters ($hm^3$) of water over six months, minimizing the deficit to 9.7% of the total estimated demand. The methodology demonstrated significant environmental benefits, reducing CO2 emissions while optimizing resource distribution. This robust solution supports informed decision-making processes, ensuring sustainable water management across diverse contexts. The generalizability of this approach allows its adaptation to other basins, contributing to improved governance and policy implementation on a broader scale. Ultimately, the methodology has been validated and integrated into the operational water management practices in the Segura Hydrographic Basin in Spain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Nickel</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid model validation via the train-test paradigm has been a key driver for the breathtaking progress in machine learning and AI. However, modern AI systems often depend on a combination of tasks and data collection practices that violate all assumptions ensuring test validity. Yet, without rigorous model validation we cannot ensure the intended outcomes of deployed AI systems, including positive social impact, nor continue to advance AI research in a scientifically sound way. In this paper, I will show that for widely considered inference settings in complex social systems the train-test paradigm does not only lack a justification but is indeed invalid for any risk estimator, including counterfactual and causal estimators, with high probability. These formal impossibility results highlight a fundamental epistemic issue, i.e., that for key tasks in modern AI we cannot know whether models are valid under current data collection practices. Importantly, this includes variants of both recommender systems and reasoning via large language models, and neither na\"ive scaling nor limited benchmarks are suited to address this issue. I am illustrating these results via the widely used MovieLens benchmark and conclude by discussing the implications of these results for AI in social systems, including possible remedies such as participatory data curation and open science.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models based on transformer algorithms have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence by enabling verbal interaction with machines akin to human conversation. These AI agents have surpassed the Turing Test, achieving confusion rates up to 50%. However, challenges persist, especially with the advent of robots and the need to humanize machines for improved Human-AI collaboration. In this experiment, three GPT agents with varying levels of agreeableness (disagreeable, neutral, agreeable) based on the Big Five Inventory were tested in a Turing Test. All exceeded a 50% confusion rate, with the highly agreeable AI agent surpassing 60%. This agent was also recognized as exhibiting the most human-like traits. Various explanations in the literature address why these GPT agents were perceived as human, including psychological frameworks for understanding anthropomorphism. These findings highlight the importance of personality engineering as an emerging discipline in artificial intelligence, calling for collaboration with psychology to develop ergonomic psychological models that enhance system adaptability in collaborative activities.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13867">Generative Fuzzy System for Sequence Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hailong Yang, Zhaohong Deng, Wei Zhang, Zhuangzhuang Zhao, Guanjin Wang, Kup-sze Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Models (GMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have garnered significant attention in machine learning and artificial intelligence for their ability to generate new data by learning the statistical properties of training data and creating data that resemble the original. This capability offers a wide range of applications across various domains. However, the complex structures and numerous model parameters of GMs make the input-output processes opaque, complicating the understanding and control of outputs. Moreover, the purely data-driven learning mechanism limits GM's ability to acquire broader knowledge. There remains substantial potential for enhancing the robustness and generalization capabilities of GMs. In this work, we introduce the fuzzy system, a classical modeling method that combines data and knowledge-driven mechanisms, to generative tasks. We propose a novel Generative Fuzzy System framework, named GenFS, which integrates the deep learning capabilities of GM with the interpretability and dual-driven mechanisms of fuzzy systems. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end GenFS-based model for sequence generation, called FuzzyS2S. A series of experimental studies were conducted on 12 datasets, covering three distinct categories of generative tasks: machine translation, code generation, and summary generation. The results demonstrate that FuzzyS2S outperforms the Transformer in terms of accuracy and fluency. Furthermore, it exhibits better performance on some datasets compared to state-of-the-art models T5 and CodeT5.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13932">XAgents: A Framework for Interpretable Rule-Based Multi-Agents Cooperation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hailong Yang, Mingxian Gu, Renhuo Zhao, Fuping Hu, Zhaohong Deng, Yitang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting implicit knowledge and logical reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) has consistently been a significant challenge. The advancement of multi-agent systems has further en-hanced the capabilities of LLMs. Inspired by the structure of multi-polar neurons (MNs), we propose the XAgents framework, an in-terpretable multi-agent cooperative framework based on the IF-THEN rule-based system. The IF-Parts of the rules are responsible for logical reasoning and domain membership calculation, while the THEN-Parts are comprised of domain expert agents that generate domain-specific contents. Following the calculation of the member-ship, XAgetns transmits the task to the disparate domain rules, which subsequently generate the various responses. These re-sponses are analogous to the answers provided by different experts to the same question. The final response is reached at by eliminat-ing the hallucinations and erroneous knowledge of the LLM through membership computation and semantic adversarial genera-tion of the various domain rules. The incorporation of rule-based interpretability serves to bolster user confidence in the XAgents framework. We evaluate the efficacy of XAgents through a com-parative analysis with the latest AutoAgents, in which XAgents demonstrated superior performance across three distinct datasets. We perform post-hoc interpretable studies with SHAP algorithm and case studies, proving the interpretability of XAgent in terms of input-output feature correlation and rule-based semantics.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14012">Logic Augmented Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aldo Gangemi, Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Knowledge Graphs (SKG) face challenges with scalability, flexibility, contextual understanding, and handling unstructured or ambiguous information. However, they offer formal and structured knowledge enabling highly interpretable and reliable results by means of reasoning and querying. Large Language Models (LLMs) overcome those limitations making them suitable in open-ended tasks and unstructured environments. Nevertheless, LLMs are neither interpretable nor reliable. To solve the dichotomy between LLMs and SKGs we envision Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) that combines the benefits of the two worlds. LAG uses LLMs as Reactive Continuous Knowledge Graphs that can generate potentially infinite relations and tacit knowledge on-demand. SKGs are key for injecting a discrete heuristic dimension with clear logical and factual boundaries. We exemplify LAG in two tasks of collective intelligence, i.e., medical diagnostics and climate projections. Understanding the properties and limitations of LAG, which are still mostly unknown, is of utmost importance for enabling a variety of tasks involving tacit knowledge in order to provide interpretable and effective results.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14033">Multi-LLM-Agent Systems: Techniques and Business Perspectives</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingxuan Yang, Qiuying Peng, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of (multi-modal) large language models, most operational processes can be reformulated and reproduced using LLM agents. The LLM agents can perceive, control, and get feedback from the environment so as to accomplish the given tasks in an autonomous manner. Besides the environment-interaction property, the LLM agents can call various external tools to ease the task completion process. The tools can be regarded as a predefined operational process with private or real-time knowledge that does not exist in the parameters of LLMs. As a natural trend of development, the tools for calling are becoming autonomous agents, thus the full intelligent system turns out to be a multi-LLM-agent system (MLAS). This paper discusses the technical and business landscapes of MLAS. Compared to the previous single-LLM-agent system, a MLAS has the advantages of i) higher potential of task-solving performance, ii) higher flexibility for system changing, iii) proprietary data preserving for each participating entity, and iv) feasibility of monetization for each entity. To support the ecosystem of MLAS, we provide a preliminary version of such MLAS protocol considering technical requirements, data privacy, and business incentives. As such, MLAS would be a practical solution to achieve artificial collective intelligence in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junhua Liu, Fanfan Lin, Xinze Li, Kwan Hui Lim, Shuai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based autonomous agents have demonstrated outstanding performance in solving complex industrial tasks. However, in the pursuit of carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, existing AI-assisted design automation faces significant limitations in explainability, scalability, and usability. To address these challenges, we propose LP-COMDA, an LLM-based, physics-informed autonomous agent that automates the modulation design of power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human supervision. Unlike traditional AI-assisted approaches, LP-COMDA contains an LLM-based planner that gathers and validates design specifications through a user-friendly chat interface. The planner then coordinates with physics-informed design and optimization tools to iteratively generate and refine modulation designs autonomously. Through the chat interface, LP-COMDA provides an explainable design process, presenting explanations and charts. Experiments show that LP-COMDA outperforms all baseline methods, achieving a 63.2% reduction in error compared to the second-best benchmark method in terms of standard mean absolute error. Furthermore, empirical studies with 20 experts conclude that design time with LP-COMDA is over 33 times faster than conventional methods, showing its significant improvement on design efficiency over the current processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chatbots have become integral to various application domains, including those with safety-critical considerations. As a result, there is a pressing need for methods that ensure chatbots consistently adhere to expected, safe behaviours. In this paper, we introduce RV4Chatbot, a Runtime Verification framework designed to monitor deviations in chatbot behaviour. We formalise expected behaviours as interaction protocols between the user and the chatbot. We present the RV4Chatbot design and describe two implementations that instantiate it: RV4Rasa, for monitoring chatbots created with the Rasa framework, and RV4Dialogflow, for monitoring Dialogflow chatbots. Additionally, we detail experiments conducted in a factory automation scenario using both RV4Rasa and RV4Dialogflow. </p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ofer Dagan, Tyler Becker, Zachary N. Sunberg</p>
<p>Abstract: When human operators of cyber-physical systems encounter surprising behavior, they often consider multiple hypotheses that might explain it. In some cases, taking information-gathering actions such as additional measurements or control inputs given to the system can help resolve uncertainty and determine the most accurate hypothesis. The task of optimizing these actions can be formulated as a belief-space Markov decision process that we call a hypothesis-driven belief MDP. Unfortunately, this problem suffers from the curse of history similar to a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To plan in continuous domains, an agent needs to reason over countlessly many possible action-observation histories, each resulting in a different belief over the unknown state. The problem is exacerbated in the hypothesis-driven context because each action-observation pair spawns a different belief for each hypothesis, leading to additional branching. This paper considers the case in which each hypothesis corresponds to a different dynamic model in an underlying POMDP. We present a new belief MDP formulation that: (i) enables reasoning over multiple hypotheses, (ii) balances the goals of determining the (most likely) correct hypothesis and performing well in the underlying POMDP, and (iii) can be solved with sparse tree search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanqiang Guo, Yao Luan, Jianjiang Feng, Wangsheng Lu, Yin Yin, Guangming Yang, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate cerebrovascular segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is of great significance in diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular pathology. Due to the complexity and topology variability of blood vessels, complete and accurate segmentation of vascular network is still a challenge. In this paper, we proposed a Vessel Oriented Filtering Network (VOF-Net) which embeds domain knowledge into the convolutional neural network. We design oriented filters for blood vessels according to vessel orientation field, which is obtained by orientation estimation network. Features extracted by oriented filtering are injected into segmentation network, so as to make use of the prior information that the blood vessels are slender and curved tubular structure. Experimental results on datasets of CTA and MRA show that the proposed method is effective for vessel segmentation, and embedding the specific vascular filter improves the segmentation performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael Merx, Ekaterina Vylomova, Kemal Kurniawan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a study of LLMs' performance in generating and rating example sentences for bilingual dictionaries across languages with varying resource levels: French (high-resource), Indonesian (mid-resource), and Tetun (low-resource), with English as the target language. We evaluate the quality of LLM-generated examples against the GDEX (Good Dictionary EXample) criteria: typicality, informativeness, and intelligibility. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate reasonably good dictionary examples, their performance degrades significantly for lower-resourced languages. We also observe high variability in human preferences for example quality, reflected in low inter-annotator agreement rates. To address this, we demonstrate that in-context learning can successfully align LLMs with individual annotator preferences. Additionally, we explore the use of pre-trained language models for automated rating of examples, finding that sentence perplexity serves as a good proxy for typicality and intelligibility in higher-resourced languages. Our study also contributes a novel dataset of 600 ratings for LLM-generated sentence pairs, and provides insights into the potential of LLMs in reducing the cost of lexicographic work, particularly for low-resource languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Garg, Trilok Padhi, Hemang Jain, Ugur Kursuncu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Toxicity identification in online multimodal environments remains a challenging task due to the complexity of contextual connections across modalities (e.g., textual and visual). In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes. Our approach extracts sub-knowledge graphs from ConceptNet, a large-scale commonsense Knowledge Graph (KG) to be infused within a compact VLM framework. The relational context between toxic phrases in captions and memes, as well as visual concepts in memes enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results from our study on two hate speech benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%, respectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task, our approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e. KG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a hybrid neurosymbolic approach. This is crucial for real-world applications where accurate and scalable recognition of toxic content is critical for creating safer online environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhendong Liu, Yi Nian, Henry Peng Zou, Li Li, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: How can models effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in complex, multi-label settings without extensive retraining? Existing OOD detection methods struggle to capture the intricate semantic relationships and label co-occurrences inherent in multi-label settings, often requiring large amounts of training data and failing to generalize to unseen label combinations. While large language models have revolutionized zero-shot OOD detection, they primarily focus on single-label scenarios, leaving a critical gap in handling real-world tasks where samples can be associated with multiple interdependent labels. To address these challenges, we introduce COOD, a novel zero-shot multi-label OOD detection framework. COOD leverages pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing them with a concept-based label expansion strategy and a new scoring function. By enriching the semantic space with both positive and negative concepts for each label, our approach models complex label dependencies, precisely differentiating OOD samples without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving approximately 95% average AUROC on both VOC and COCO datasets, while maintaining robust performance across varying numbers of labels and different types of OOD samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Conde, Andr\'es Munoz-Arcentales, \'Alvaro Alonso, Joaqu\'in Salvach\'ua, Gabriel Huecas</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of AI and the Internet of Things is accelerating the digital transformation of society. Mobility computing presents specific barriers due to its real-time requirements, decentralization, and connectivity through wireless networks. New research on edge computing and tiny machine learning (tinyML) explores the execution of AI models on low-performance devices to address these issues. However, there are not many studies proposing agnostic architectures that manage the entire lifecycle of intelligent cyberphysical systems. This article extends a previous architecture based on FIWARE software components to implement the machine learning operations flow, enabling the management of the entire tinyML lifecycle in cyberphysical systems. We also provide a use case to showcase how to implement the FIWARE architecture through a complete example of a smart traffic system. We conclude that the FIWARE ecosystem constitutes a real reference option for developing tinyML and edge computing in cyberphysical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinchen Yang, Zhiqing Hong, Dongjiang Cao, Haotian Wang, Zejun Xie, Tian He, Yunhuai Liu, Yu Yang, Desheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Textual description of a physical location, commonly known as an address, plays an important role in location-based services(LBS) such as on-demand delivery and navigation. However, the prevalence of abnormal addresses, those containing inaccuracies that fail to pinpoint a location, have led to significant costs. Address rewriting has emerged as a solution to rectify these abnormal addresses. Despite the critical need, existing address rewriting methods are limited, typically tailored to correct specific error types, or frequently require retraining to process new address data effectively. In this study, we introduce AddrLLM, an innovative framework for address rewriting that is built upon a retrieval augmented large language model. AddrLLM overcomes aforementioned limitations through a meticulously designed Supervised Fine-Tuning module, an Address-centric Retrieval Augmented Generation module and a Bias-free Objective Alignment module. To the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the application of LLM-based address rewriting approach to solve the issue of abnormal addresses. Through comprehensive offline testing with real-world data on a national scale and subsequent online deployment, AddrLLM has demonstrated superior performance in integration with existing logistics system. It has significantly decreased the rate of parcel re-routing by approximately 43\%, underscoring its exceptional efficacy in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taowen Wang, Dongfang Liu, James Chenhao Liang, Wenhao Yang, Qifan Wang, Cheng Han, Jiebo Luo, Ruixiang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently in robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a transformative approach, enabling robots to execute complex tasks by integrating visual and linguistic inputs within an end-to-end learning framework. While VLA models offer significant capabilities, they also introduce new attack surfaces, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. With these vulnerabilities largely unexplored, this paper systematically quantifies the robustness of VLA-based robotic systems. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce an untargeted position-aware attack objective that leverages spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, this work advances both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xibo Sun, Jiarui Fang, Aoyu Li, Jinzhe Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Pierson, Zia Mehrabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Surprisingly a number of Earth's waterways remain unmapped, with a significant number in low and middle income countries. Here we build a computer vision model (WaterNet) to learn the location of waterways in the United States, based on high resolution satellite imagery and digital elevation models, and then deploy this in novel environments in the African continent. Our outputs provide detail of waterways structures hereto unmapped. When assessed against community needs requests for rural bridge building related to access to schools, health care facilities and agricultural markets, we find these newly generated waterways capture on average 93% (country range: 88-96%) of these requests whereas Open Street Map, and the state of the art data from TDX-Hydro, capture only 36% (5-72%) and 62% (37%-85%), respectively. Because these new machine learning enabled maps are built on public and operational data acquisition this approach offers promise for capturing humanitarian needs and planning for social development in places where cartographic efforts have so far failed to deliver. The improved performance in identifying community needs missed by existing data suggests significant value for rural infrastructure development and better targeting of development interventions.</p>

<p>Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of identifying a precise location on an interface image from a natural language query, plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents. While general VLMs, such as GPT-4V, demonstrate strong performance across various tasks, their proficiency in GUI grounding remains suboptimal. Recent studies have focused on fine-tuning these models specifically for one-shot GUI grounding, yielding significant improvements over baseline performance. We introduce a visual prompting framework called Iterative Narrowing (IN) to further enhance the performance of both general and fine-tuned models in GUI grounding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lamia Berriche, Maha Driss, Areej Ahmed Almuntashri, Asma Mufreh Lghabi, Heba Saleh Almudhi, Munerah Abdul-Aziz Almansour</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new application named ArPA for Arabic kids who have trouble with pronunciation. Our application comprises two key components: the diagnostic module and the therapeutic module. The diagnostic process involves capturing the child's speech signal, preprocessing, and analyzing it using different machine learning classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees as well as deep neural network classifiers like ResNet18. The therapeutic module offers eye-catching gamified interfaces in which each correctly spoken letter earns a higher avatar level, providing positive reinforcement for the child's pronunciation improvement. Two datasets were used for experimental evaluation: one from a childcare centre and the other including Arabic alphabet pronunciation recordings. Our work uses a novel technique for speech recognition using Melspectrogram and MFCC images. The results show that the ResNet18 classifier on speech-to-image converted data effectively identifies mispronunciations in Arabic speech with an accuracy of 99.015\% with Mel-Spectrogram images outperforming ResNet18 with MFCC images.</p>

<p>Abstract: The primary concern of this research is to take American Sign Language (ASL) data through real time camera footage and be able to convert the data and information into text. Adding to that, we are also putting focus on creating a framework that can also convert text into sign language in real time which can help us break the language barrier for the people who are in need. In this work, for recognising American Sign Language (ASL), we have used the You Only Look Once(YOLO) model and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. YOLO model is run in real time and automatically extracts discriminative spatial-temporal characteristics from the raw video stream without the need for any prior knowledge, eliminating design flaws. The CNN model here is also run in real time for sign language detection. We have introduced a novel method for converting text based input to sign language by making a framework that will take a sentence as input, identify keywords from that sentence and then show a video where sign language is performed with respect to the sentence given as input in real time. To the best of our knowledge, this is a rare study to demonstrate bidirectional sign language communication in real time in the American Sign Language (ASL).</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success recently, displaying exceptional capabilities in creating understandable and organized text. These LLMs have been utilized in diverse fields, such as clinical research, where domain-specific models like Med-Palm have achieved human-level performance. Recently, researchers have employed advanced prompt engineering to enhance the general reasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the remarkable success of zero-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) in solving general reasoning tasks, the potential of these methods still remains paid limited attention in the financial reasoning task.To address this issue, we explore multiple prompt strategies and incorporated semantic news information to improve LLMs' performance on financial reasoning tasks.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this important issue by applying ChatGPT to the gold investment.In this work, our aim is to investigate the financial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their capacity to generate logical and persuasive investment opinions. We will use ChatGPT, one of the most powerful LLMs recently, and prompt engineering to achieve this goal. Our research will focus on understanding the ability of LLMs in sophisticated analysis and reasoning within the context of investment decision-making.

<p>Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) present significant challenges for early and accurate diagnosis. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing cardiac function and diagnosing CVDs, its high cost and technical complexity limit accessibility. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) offers promise for large-scale early screening. This study introduces CardiacNets, an innovative model that enhances ECG analysis by leveraging the diagnostic strengths of CMR through cross-modal contrastive learning and generative pretraining. CardiacNets serves two primary functions: (1) it evaluates detailed cardiac function indicators and screens for potential CVDs, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, using ECG input; and (2) it enhances interpretability by generating high-quality CMR images from ECG data. We train and validate the proposed CardiacNets on two large-scale public datasets (the UK Biobank with 41,519 individuals and the MIMIC-IV-ECG comprising 501,172 samples) as well as three private datasets (FAHZU with 410 individuals, SAHZU with 464 individuals, and QPH with 338 individuals), and the findings demonstrate that CardiacNets consistently outperforms traditional ECG-only models, substantially improving screening accuracy. Furthermore, the generated CMR images provide valuable diagnostic support for physicians of all experience levels. This proof-of-concept study highlights how ECG can facilitate cross-modal insights into cardiac function assessment, paving the way for enhanced CVD screening and diagnosis at a population level.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since its advent in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC) has garnered increasing attention from both academia and industry. However, due to the massive transaction volume, no systematic study has quantitatively measured the asset decentralization degree specifically from a network perspective.
  In this paper, by conducting a thorough analysis of the BTC transaction network, we first address the significant gap in the availability of full-history BTC graph and network property dataset, which spans over 15 years from the genesis block (1st March, 2009) to the 845651-th block (29, May 2024). We then present the first systematic investigation to profile BTC's asset decentralization and design several decentralization degrees for quantification. Through extensive experiments, we emphasize the significant role of network properties and our network-based decentralization degree in enhancing Bitcoin analysis. Our findings demonstrate the importance of our comprehensive dataset and analysis in advancing research on Bitcoin's transaction dynamics and decentralization, providing valuable insights into the network's structure and its implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios P. Panagoulias, Elissaios Sarmas, Vangelis Marinakis, Maria Virvou, George A. Tsihrintzis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach to Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) by introducing the Extreme Value Dynamic Benchmarking Method (EVDBM). EVDBM integrates extreme value theory to detect extreme events and is coupled with the novel Dynamic Identification of Significant Correlation (DISC)-Thresholding algorithm, which enhances the analysis of key variables under extreme conditions. By integrating return values predicted through EVA into the benchmarking scores, we are able to transform these scores to reflect anticipated conditions more accurately. This provides a more precise picture of how each case is projected to unfold under extreme conditions. As a result, the adjusted scores offer a forward-looking perspective, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and resilience factors for each case in a way that static historical data alone cannot capture. By incorporating both historical and probabilistic elements, the EVDBM algorithm provides a comprehensive benchmarking framework that is adaptable to a range of scenarios and contexts. The methodology is applied to real PV data, revealing critical low - production scenarios and significant correlations between variables, which aid in risk management, infrastructure design, and long-term planning, while also allowing for the comparison of different production plants. The flexibility of EVDBM suggests its potential for broader applications in other sectors where decision-making sensitivity is crucial, offering valuable insights to improve outcomes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direct preference learning offers a promising and computation-efficient beyond supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for improving code generation in coding large language models (LMs). However, the scarcity of reliable preference data is a bottleneck for the performance of direct preference learning to improve the coding accuracy of code LMs. In this paper, we introduce \underline{\textbf{D}}irect Preference Learning with Only \underline{\textbf{S}}elf-Generated \underline{\textbf{T}}ests and \underline{\textbf{C}}ode (DSTC), a framework that leverages only self-generated code snippets and tests to construct reliable preference pairs such that direct preference learning can improve LM coding accuracy without external annotations. DSTC combines a minimax selection process and test-code concatenation to improve preference pair quality, reducing the influence of incorrect self-generated tests and enhancing model performance without the need for costly reward models. When applied with direct preference learning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), DSTC yields stable improvements in coding accuracy (pass@1 score) across diverse coding benchmarks, including HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench, demonstrating both its effectiveness and scalability for models of various sizes. This approach autonomously enhances code generation accuracy across LLMs of varying sizes, reducing reliance on expensive annotated coding datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phu Nguyen, Daniel Polani, Stas Tiomkin</p>
<p>Abstract: The reward function is an essential component in robot learning. Reward directly affects the sample and computational complexity of learning, and the quality of a solution. The design of informative rewards requires domain knowledge, which is not always available. We use the properties of the dynamics to produce system-appropriate reward without adding external assumptions. Specifically, we explore an approach to utilize the Lyapunov exponents of the system dynamics to generate a system-immanent reward. We demonstrate that the `Sum of the Positive Lyapunov Exponents' (SuPLE) is a strong candidate for the design of such a reward. We develop a computational framework for the derivation of this reward, and demonstrate its effectiveness on classical benchmarks for sample-based stabilization of various dynamical systems. It eliminates the need to start the training trajectories at arbitrary states, also known as auxiliary exploration. While the latter is a common practice in simulated robot learning, it is unpractical to consider to use it in real robotic systems, since they typically start from natural rest states such as a pendulum at the bottom, a robot on the ground, etc. and can not be easily initialized at arbitrary states. Comparing the performance of SuPLE to commonly-used reward functions, we observe that the latter fail to find a solution without auxiliary exploration, even for the task of swinging up the double pendulum and keeping it stable at the upright position, a prototypical scenario for multi-linked robots. SuPLE-induced rewards for robot learning offer a novel route for effective robot learning in typical as opposed to highly specialized or fine-tuned scenarios. Our code is publicly available for reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: The reliability of supervised classifiers is severely hampered by their limitations in dealing with unexpected inputs, leading to great interest in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Recently, OOD detectors trained on synthetic outliers, especially those generated by large diffusion models, have shown promising results in defining robust OOD decision boundaries. Building on this progress, we present NCIS, which enhances the quality of synthetic outliers by operating directly in the diffusion's model embedding space rather than combining disjoint models as in previous work and by modeling class-conditional manifolds with a conditional volume-preserving network for more expressive characterization of the training distribution. We demonstrate that these improvements yield new state-of-the-art OOD detection results on standard ImageNet100 and CIFAR100 benchmarks and provide insights into the importance of data pre-processing and other key design choices. We make our code available at \url{https://github.com/LarsDoorenbos/NCIS}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cryptographic protocols play a fundamental role in securing modern digital infrastructure, but they are often deployed without prior formal verification. This could lead to the adoption of distributed systems vulnerable to attack vectors. Formal verification methods, on the other hand, require complex and time-consuming techniques that lack automatization. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously identify vulnerabilities in new cryptographic protocols through interaction with Tamarin: a theorem prover for protocol verification. We created a manually validated dataset of novel, flawed, communication protocols and designed a method to automatically verify the vulnerabilities found by the AI agents. Our results about the performances of the current frontier models on the benchmark provides insights about the possibility of cybersecurity applications by integrating LLMs with symbolic reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Carneiro, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in multimodal environments is crucial for various applications, from video conferencing to human-robot interaction. This paper introduces FabuLight-ASD, an advanced ASD model that integrates facial, audio, and body pose information to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Our model builds upon the existing Light-ASD framework by incorporating human pose data, represented through skeleton graphs, which minimises computational overhead. Using the Wilder Active Speaker Detection (WASD) dataset, renowned for reliable face and body bounding box annotations, we demonstrate FabuLight-ASD's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Achieving an overall mean average precision (mAP) of 94.3%, FabuLight-ASD outperforms Light-ASD, which has an overall mAP of 93.7% across various challenging scenarios. The incorporation of body pose information shows a particularly advantageous impact, with notable improvements in mAP observed in scenarios with speech impairment, face occlusion, and human voice background noise. Furthermore, efficiency analysis indicates only a modest increase in parameter count (27.3%) and multiply-accumulate operations (up to 2.4%), underscoring the model's efficiency and feasibility.

<p>Abstract: We propose Hymba, a family of small language models featuring a hybrid-head parallel architecture that integrates transformer attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs) for enhanced efficiency. Attention heads provide high-resolution recall, while SSM heads enable efficient context summarization. Additionally, we introduce learnable meta tokens that are prepended to prompts, storing critical information and alleviating the "forced-to-attend" burden associated with attention mechanisms. This model is further optimized by incorporating cross-layer key-value (KV) sharing and partial sliding window attention, resulting in a compact cache size. During development, we conducted a controlled study comparing various architectures under identical settings and observed significant advantages of our proposed architecture. Notably, Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results for small LMs: Our Hymba-1.5B-Base model surpasses all sub-2B public models in performance and even outperforms Llama-3.2-3B with 1.32% higher average accuracy, an 11.67x cache size reduction, and 3.49x throughput.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kenneth Shaw, Yulong Li, Jiahui Yang, Mohan Kumar Srirama, Ray Liu, Haoyu Xiong, Russell Mendonca, Deepak Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: To train generalist robot policies, machine learning methods often require a substantial amount of expert human teleoperation data. An ideal robot for humans collecting data is one that closely mimics them: bimanual arms and dexterous hands. However, creating such a bimanual teleoperation system with over 50 DoF is a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Bidex, an extremely dexterous, low-cost, low-latency and portable bimanual dexterous teleoperation system which relies on motion capture gloves and teacher arms. We compare Bidex to a Vision Pro teleoperation system and a SteamVR system and find Bidex to produce better quality data for more complex tasks at a faster rate. Additionally, we show Bidex operating a mobile bimanual robot for in the wild tasks. The robot hands (5k USD) and teleoperation system (7k USD) is readily reproducible and can be used on many robot arms including two xArms (16k USD). Website at https://bidex-teleop.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziang Yin, Meng Zhang, Amir Begovic, Rena Huang, Jeff Zhang, Jiaqi Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs) offer transformative potential for next-generation high-performance AI but require interdisciplinary advances across devices, circuits, architecture, and design automation. The complexity of hybrid systems makes it challenging even for domain experts to understand distinct behaviors and interactions across design stack. The lack of a flexible, accurate, fast, and easy-to-use EPIC AI system simulation framework significantly limits the exploration of hardware innovations and system evaluations on common benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose SimPhony, a cross-layer modeling and simulation framework for heterogeneous electronic-photonic AI systems. SimPhony offers a platform that enables (1) generic, extensible hardware topology representation that supports heterogeneous multi-core architectures with diverse photonic tensor core designs; (2) optics-specific dataflow modeling with unique multi-dimensional parallelism and reuse beyond spatial/temporal dimensions; (3) data-aware energy modeling with realistic device responses, layout-aware area estimation, link budget analysis, and bandwidth-adaptive memory modeling; and (4) seamless integration with model training framework for hardware/software co-simulation. By providing a unified, versatile, and high-fidelity simulation platform, SimPhony enables researchers to innovate and evaluate EPIC AI hardware across multiple domains, facilitating the next leap in emerging AI hardware.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Wang, Hassan A. Karimi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing impacts of climate change, there is a growing demand for accessible tools that can provide reliable future climate information to support planning, finance, and other decision-making applications. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, present a promising approach to bridging the gap between complex climate data and the general public, offering a way for non-specialist users to obtain essential climate insights through natural language interaction. However, an essential challenge remains under-explored: evaluating the ability of LLMs to provide accurate and reliable future climate predictions, which is crucial for applications that rely on anticipating climate trends. In this study, we investigate the capability of GPT-4 in predicting rainfall at short-term (15-day) and long-term (12-month) scales. We designed a series of experiments to assess GPT's performance under different conditions, including scenarios with and without expert data inputs. Our results indicate that GPT, when operating independently, tends to generate conservative forecasts, often reverting to historical averages in the absence of clear trend signals. This study highlights both the potential and challenges of applying LLMs for future climate predictions, providing insights into their integration with climate-related applications and suggesting directions for enhancing their predictive capabilities in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zi Wang, Fei Wu, Feng Yu, Yurui Zhou, Jia Hu, Geyong Min</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge-AI, the convergence of edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI), has become a promising paradigm that enables the deployment of advanced AI models at the network edge, close to users. In Edge-AI, federated continual learning (FCL) has emerged as an imperative framework, which fuses knowledge from different clients while preserving data privacy and retaining knowledge from previous tasks as it learns new ones. By so doing, FCL aims to ensure stable and reliable performance of learning models in dynamic and distributed environments. In this survey, we thoroughly review the state-of-the-art research and present the first comprehensive survey of FCL for Edge-AI. We categorize FCL methods based on three task characteristics: federated class continual learning, federated domain continual learning, and federated task continual learning. For each category, an in-depth investigation and review of the representative methods are provided, covering background, challenges, problem formalisation, solutions, and limitations. Besides, existing real-world applications empowered by FCL are reviewed, indicating the current progress and potential of FCL in diverse application domains. Furthermore, we discuss and highlight several prospective research directions of FCL such as algorithm-hardware co-design for FCL and FCL with foundation models, which could provide insights into the future development and practical deployment of FCL in the era of Edge-AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjay Das, Swastik Bhattacharya, Souvik Kundu, Shamik Kundu, Anand Menon, Arnab Raha, Kanad Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiyang Qin, Dancheng Liu, Gelei Xu, Zheyu Yan, Chenhui Xu, Yuting Hu, X. Sharon Hu, Jinjun Xiong, Yiyu Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), when deployed on edge devices (called edge ASR-LLM), can serve as a powerful personalized assistant to enable audio-based interaction for users. Compared to text-based interaction, edge ASR-LLM allows accessible and natural audio interactions. Unfortunately, existing ASR-LLM models are mainly trained in high-performance computing environments and produce substantial model weights, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. More importantly, to better serve users' personalized needs, the ASR-LLM must be able to learn from each distinct user, given that audio input often contains highly personalized characteristics that necessitate personalized on-device training. Since individually fine-tuning the ASR or LLM often leads to suboptimal results due to modality-specific limitations, end-to-end training ensures seamless integration of audio features and language understanding (cross-modal alignment), ultimately enabling a more personalized and efficient adaptation on edge devices. However, due to the complex training requirements and substantial computational demands of existing approaches, cross-modal alignment between ASR audio and LLM can be challenging on edge devices. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient cross-modal alignment framework that bridges ASR and LLMs on edge devices to handle personalized audio input. Our framework enables efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained devices like NVIDIA Jetson Orin (8GB RAM), achieving 50x training time speedup while improving the alignment quality by more than 50\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boming Xia, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu, Zhenchang Xing, Dehai Zhao, Hao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of LLM agents capable of autonomously achieving under-specified goals and continuously evolving through post-deployment improvement, sometimes without requiring code or model updates. Conventional approaches, such as pre-defined test cases and code/model redevelopment pipelines, are inadequate for addressing the unique challenges of LLM agent development, particularly in terms of quality and risk control. This paper introduces an evaluation-driven design approach, inspired by test-driven development, to address these challenges. Through a multivocal literature review (MLR), we synthesize existing LLM evaluation methods and propose a novel process model and reference architecture specifically designed for LLM agents. The proposed approach integrates online and offline evaluations to support adaptive runtime adjustments and systematic offline redevelopment, improving runtime pipelines, artifacts, system architecture, and LLMs by continuously incorporating evaluation results, including fine-grained feedback from human and AI evaluators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently processing and interpreting network data is critical for the operation of increasingly complex networks. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have improved data processing in network management. However, existing RAG methods like VectorRAG and GraphRAG struggle with the complexity and implicit nature of semi-structured technical data, leading to inefficiencies in time, cost, and retrieval. This paper introduces FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data. FastRAG employs schema learning and script learning to extract and structure data without needing to submit entire data sources to an LLM. It integrates text search with knowledge graph (KG) querying to improve accuracy in retrieving context-rich information. Evaluation results demonstrate that FastRAG provides accurate question answering, while improving up to 90% in time and 85% in cost compared to GraphRAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhao Yan, Pingchuan Yan, Yulong Chen, Jing Li, Xianchao Zhu, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4's translation capabilities compared to human translators of varying expertise levels. Through systematic human evaluation using the MQM schema, we assess translations across three language pairs (Chinese$\longleftrightarrow$English, Russian$\longleftrightarrow$English, and Chinese$\longleftrightarrow$Hindi) and three domains (News, Technology, and Biomedical). Our findings reveal that GPT-4 achieves performance comparable to junior-level translators in terms of total errors, while still lagging behind senior translators. Unlike traditional Neural Machine Translation systems, which show significant performance degradation in resource-poor language directions, GPT-4 maintains consistent translation quality across all evaluated language pairs. Through qualitative analysis, we identify distinctive patterns in translation approaches: GPT-4 tends toward overly literal translations and exhibits lexical inconsistency, while human translators sometimes over-interpret context and introduce hallucinations. This study represents the first systematic comparison between LLM and human translators across different proficiency levels, providing valuable insights into the current capabilities and limitations of LLM-based translation systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent text but often struggle with grounding language and strategic dialogue. To address this gap, we focus on journalistic interviews, a domain rich in grounding communication and abundant in data. We curate a dataset of 40,000 two-person informational interviews from NPR and CNN, and reveal that LLMs are significantly less likely than human interviewers to use acknowledgements and to pivot to higher-level questions. Realizing that a fundamental deficit exists in multi-turn planning and strategic thinking, we develop a realistic simulated environment, incorporating source personas and persuasive elements, in order to facilitate the development of agents with longer-horizon rewards. Our experiments show that while source LLMs mimic human behavior in information sharing, interviewer LLMs struggle with recognizing when questions are answered and engaging persuasively, leading to suboptimal information extraction across model size and capability. These findings underscore the need for enhancing LLMs' strategic dialogue capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changhai Zhou, Shiyang Zhang, Yuhua Zhou, Zekai Liu, Shichao Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under resource constraints is a significant challenge in deep learning. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), pruning, and quantization are all effective methods for improving resource efficiency. However, combining them directly often results in suboptimal performance, especially with uniform quantization across all model layers. This is due to the complex, uneven interlayer relationships introduced by pruning, necessitating more refined quantization strategies. To address this, we propose AutoMixQ, an end-to-end optimization framework that selects optimal quantization configurations for each LLM layer. AutoMixQ leverages lightweight performance models to guide the selection process, significantly reducing time and computational resources compared to exhaustive search methods. By incorporating Pareto optimality, AutoMixQ balances memory usage and performance, approaching the upper bounds of model capability under strict resource constraints. Our experiments on widely used benchmarks show that AutoMixQ reduces memory consumption while achieving superior performance. For example, at a 30\% pruning rate in LLaMA-7B, AutoMixQ achieved 66.21\% on BoolQ compared to 62.45\% for LoRA and 58.96\% for LoftQ, while reducing memory consumption by 35.5\% compared to LoRA and 27.5\% compared to LoftQ.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao Wang, Jia Li, Heng Chang, Keli Zhang, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we discover that causal inference provides a promising approach to capture heterophilic message-passing in Graph Neural Network (GNN). By leveraging cause-effect analysis, we can discern heterophilic edges based on asymmetric node dependency. The learned causal structure offers more accurate relationships among nodes. To reduce the computational complexity, we introduce intervention-based causal inference in graph learning. We first simplify causal analysis on graphs by formulating it as a structural learning model and define the optimization problem within the Bayesian scheme. We then present an analysis of decomposing the optimization target into a consistency penalty and a structure modification based on cause-effect relations. We then estimate this target by conditional entropy and present insights into how conditional entropy quantifies the heterophily. Accordingly, we propose CausalMP, a causal message-passing discovery network for heterophilic graph learning, that iteratively learns the explicit causal structure of input graphs. We conduct extensive experiments in both heterophilic and homophilic graph settings. The result demonstrates that the our model achieves superior link prediction performance. Training on causal structure can also enhance node representation in classification task across different base models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyao Ma, Menglin Yang, Mingxuan Ju, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern recommendation systems often create information cocoons, limiting users' exposure to diverse content. To enhance user experience, a crucial challenge is developing systems that can balance content exploration and exploitation, allowing users to adjust their recommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be achieved through a tree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and breadth search enables exploration. However, current works face two challenges to achieve this target: (1) Euclidean methods fail to fully capture hierarchical structures and lack flexibility in balancing exploration-exploitation, while (2) hyperbolic approaches, despite better hierarchical modeling, suffer from insufficient semantic alignment due to their reliance on Euclidean text encoders. To address these challenges, we propose HARec, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that jointly aligns user-item collaborative information with textual descriptions in hyperbolic space. Our framework introduces two key technique novelty: (1) a hierarchical-aware graph-llm alignment mechanism that enables better hierarchical representation, and (2) a hyperbolic hierarchical tree structure that facilitates user-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HARec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39% increase in diversity metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The escalating threat of phishing emails has become increasingly sophisticated with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). As attackers exploit LLMs to craft more convincing and evasive phishing emails, it is crucial to assess the resilience of current phishing defenses. In this study we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of traditional phishing detectors, such as Gmail Spam Filter, Apache SpamAssassin, and Proofpoint, as well as machine learning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, in identifying both traditional and LLM-rephrased phishing emails. We also explore the emerging role of LLMs as phishing detection tools, a method already adopted by companies like NTT Security Holdings and JPMorgan Chase. Our results reveal notable declines in detection accuracy for rephrased emails across all detectors, highlighting critical weaknesses in current phishing defenses. As the threat landscape evolves, our findings underscore the need for stronger security controls and regulatory oversight on LLM-generated content to prevent its misuse in creating advanced phishing attacks. This study contributes to the development of more effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) by leveraging LLMs to generate diverse phishing variants that can be used for data augmentation, harnessing the power of LLMs to enhance phishing detection, and paving the way for more robust and adaptable threat detection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prabhat Lankireddy, Jayakrishnan Nair, D Manjunath</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze the effect that online algorithms have on the environment that they are learning. As a motivation, consider recommendation systems that use online algorithms to learn optimal product recommendations based on user and product attributes. It is well known that the sequence of recommendations affects user preferences. However, typical learning algorithms treat the user attributes as static and disregard the impact of their recommendations on user preferences. Our interest is to analyze the effect of this mismatch between the model assumption of a static environment, and the reality of an evolving environment affected by the recommendations. To perform this analysis, we first introduce a model for a generic coupled evolution of the parameters that are being learned, and the environment that is affected by it. We then frame a linear bandit recommendation system (RS) into this generic model where the users are characterized by a state variable that evolves based on the sequence of recommendations. The learning algorithm of the RS does not explicitly account for this evolution and assumes that the users are static. A dynamical system model that captures the coupled evolution of the population state and the learning algorithm is described, and its equilibrium behavior is analyzed. We show that when the recommendation algorithm is able to learn the population preferences in the presence of this mismatch, the algorithm induces similarity in the preferences of the user population. In particular, we present results on how different properties of the recommendation algorithm, namely the user attribute space and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, effect the population preferences when they are learned by the algorithm. We demonstrate these results using model simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In China, receptionist nurses face overwhelming workloads in outpatient settings, limiting their time and attention for each patient and ultimately reducing service quality. In this paper, we present the Personalized Intelligent Outpatient Reception System (PIORS). This system integrates an LLM-based reception nurse and a collaboration between LLM and hospital information system (HIS) into real outpatient reception setting, aiming to deliver personalized, high-quality, and efficient reception services. Additionally, to enhance the performance of LLMs in real-world healthcare scenarios, we propose a medical conversational data generation framework named Service Flow aware Medical Scenario Simulation (SFMSS), aiming to adapt the LLM to the real-world environments and PIORS settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Srivastava</p>
<p>Abstract: The urgent need to promptly detect cardiac disorders from 12-lead Electrocardiograms using limited computations is motivated by the heart's fast and complex electrical activity and restricted computational power of portable devices. Timely and precise diagnoses are crucial since delays might significantly impact patient health outcomes. This research presents a novel deep-learning architecture that aims to diagnose heart abnormalities quickly and accurately. We devised a new activation function called aSoftMax, designed to improve the visibility of ECG deflections. The proposed activation function is used with Convolutional Neural Network architecture to includes kernel weight sharing across the ECG's various leads. This innovative method thoroughly generalizes the global 12-lead ECG features and minimizes the model's complexity by decreasing the trainable parameters. aSoftMax, combined with enhanced CNN architecture yielded AmpliNetECG12, we obtain exceptional accuracy of 84% in diagnosing cardiac disorders. AmpliNetECG12 shows outstanding prediction ability when used with the CPSC2018 dataset for arrhythmia classification. The model attains an F1-score of 80.71% and a ROC-AUC score of 96.00%, with 280,000 trainable parameters which signifies the lightweight yet efficient nature of AmpliNetECG12. The stochastic characteristics of aSoftMax, a fundamental element of AmpliNetECG12, improve prediction accuracy and also increasse the model's interpretability. This feature enhances comprehension of important ECG segments in different forms of arrhythmias, establishing a new standard of explainable architecture for cardiac disorder classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunrui Sun, Gang Hu, Yinglei Teng, Dunbo Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a promising collaborative machine learning approach, enabling resource-constrained devices to train models without sharing raw data, while reducing computational load and preserving privacy simultaneously. However, current SL algorithms face limitations in training efficiency and suffer from prolonged latency, particularly in sequential settings, where the slowest device can bottleneck the entire process due to heterogeneous resources and frequent data exchanges between clients and servers. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Split Federated Learning (HSFL) framework, which allows resource-constrained clients to train their personalized client-side models in parallel, utilizing different cut layers. Aiming to mitigate the impact of heterogeneous environments and accelerate the training process, we formulate a latency minimization problem that optimizes computational and transmission resources jointly. Additionally, we design a resource allocation algorithm that combines the Sample Average Approximation (SAA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Lagrangian relaxation and Branch and Bound (B\&B) methods to efficiently solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that HSFL outperforms other frameworks in terms of both convergence rate and model accuracy on heterogeneous devices with non-iid data, while the optimization algorithm is better than other baseline methods in reducing latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yancheng Liang, Daphne Chen, Abhishek Gupta, Simon S. Du, Natasha Jaques</p>
<p>Abstract: Training agents that can coordinate zero-shot with humans is a key mission in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Current algorithms focus on training simulated human partner policies which are then used to train a Cooperator agent. The simulated human is produced either through behavior cloning over a dataset of human cooperation behavior, or by using MARL to create a population of simulated agents. However, these approaches often struggle to produce a Cooperator that can coordinate well with real humans, since the simulated humans fail to cover the diverse strategies and styles employed by people in the real world. We show \emph{learning a generative model of human partners} can effectively address this issue. Our model learns a latent variable representation of the human that can be regarded as encoding the human's unique strategy, intention, experience, or style. This generative model can be flexibly trained from any (human or neural policy) agent interaction data. By sampling from the latent space, we can use the generative model to produce different partners to train Cooperator agents. We evaluate our method -- \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}odeling for \textbf{M}ulti-agent \textbf{A}daptation (GAMMA) -- on Overcooked, a challenging cooperative cooking game that has become a standard benchmark for zero-shot coordination. We conduct an evaluation with real human teammates, and the results show that GAMMA consistently improves performance, whether the generative model is trained on simulated populations or human datasets. Further, we propose a method for posterior sampling from the generative model that is biased towards the human data, enabling us to efficiently improve performance with only a small amount of expensive human interaction data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yalan Lin, Yingwei Ma, Rongyu Cao, Binhua Li, Fei Huang, Xiaodong Gu, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reproducing buggy code is the first and crucially important step in issue resolving, as it aids in identifying the underlying problems and validating that generated patches resolve the problem. While numerous approaches have been proposed for this task, they primarily address common, widespread errors and struggle to adapt to unique, evolving errors specific to individual code repositories. To fill this gap, we propose EvoCoder, a multi-agent continuous learning framework for issue code reproduction. EvoCoder adopts a reflection mechanism that allows the LLM to continuously learn from previously resolved problems and dynamically refine its strategies to new emerging challenges. To prevent experience bloating, EvoCoder introduces a novel hierarchical experience pool that enables the model to adaptively update common and repo-specific experiences. Our experimental results show a 20\% improvement in issue reproduction rates over existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, integrating our reproduction mechanism significantly boosts the overall accuracy of the existing issue-resolving pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Wang, Chang Che, Qi Wang, Yangyang Li, Zenglin Shi, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively handle a wide range of vision tasks by framing them as language-based instructions. Building on this, continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) extends the capability of MLLMs to incrementally learn new tasks, accommodating evolving functionalities. While prior work has advanced CVIT through the development of new benchmarks and approaches to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, these efforts largely follow traditional continual learning paradigms, neglecting the unique challenges specific to CVIT. We identify a dual form of catastrophic forgetting in CVIT, where MLLMs not only forget previously learned visual understanding but also experience a decline in instruction following abilities as they acquire new tasks. To address this, we introduce the Separable Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (SMoLoRA) framework, which employs separable routing through two distinct modules - one for visual understanding and another for instruction following. This dual-routing design enables specialized adaptation in both domains, preventing forgetting while improving performance. Furthermore, we propose a novel CVIT benchmark that goes beyond existing benchmarks by additionally evaluating a model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks and handle diverse instructions across various tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SMoLoRA outperforms existing methods in mitigating dual forgetting, improving generalization to unseen tasks, and ensuring robustness in following diverse instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Thomas B\"ack, Anna V. Kononova</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijun Zhai, Pengzhan Zhou, Yuepeng He, Fang Qu, Zhida Qin, Xianlong Jiao, Guiyan Liu, Songtao Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The emerging federated learning enables distributed autonomous vehicles to train equipped deep learning models collaboratively without exposing their raw data, providing great potential for utilizing explosively growing autonomous driving data. However, considering the complicated traffic environments and driving scenarios, deploying federated learning for autonomous vehicles is inevitably challenged by non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data of vehicles, which may lead to failed convergence and low training accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchically Federated Region-learning framework of Autonomous Vehicles (FedRAV), a two-stage framework, which adaptively divides a large area containing vehicles into sub-regions based on the defined region-wise distance, and achieves personalized vehicular models and regional models. This approach ensures that the personalized vehicular model adopts the beneficial models while discarding the unprofitable ones. We validate our FedRAV framework against existing federated learning algorithms on three real-world autonomous driving datasets in various heterogeneous settings. The experiment results demonstrate that our framework outperforms those known algorithms, and improves the accuracy by at least 3.69%.

<p>Abstract: The widespread availability of multimodal generative models has sparked critical discussions on their fairness, reliability, and potential for misuse. While text-to-image models can produce high-fidelity, user-guided images, they also exhibit unpredictable behavior and vulnerabilities, which can be exploited to manipulate class or concept representations. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework designed to assess model reliability through their responses to globally- and locally-applied `semantic' perturbations in the embedding space, pinpointing inputs that trigger unreliable behavior. Our approach offers deeper insights into two essential aspects: (i) generative diversity, evaluating the breadth of visual representations for learned concepts, and (ii) generative fairness, examining how removing concepts from input prompts affects semantic guidance. Beyond these evaluations, our method lays the groundwork for detecting unreliable, bias-injected models and retrieval of bias provenance. We will release our code.

<p>Abstract: Training multimodal generative models on large, uncurated datasets can result in users being exposed to harmful, unsafe and controversial or culturally-inappropriate outputs. While model editing has been proposed to remove or filter undesirable concepts in embedding and latent spaces, it can inadvertently damage learned manifolds, distorting concepts in close semantic proximity. We identify limitations in current model editing techniques, showing that even benign, proximal concepts may become misaligned. To address the need for safe content generation, we propose a modular, dynamic solution that leverages safety-context embeddings and a dual reconstruction process using tunable weighted summation in the latent space to generate safer images. Our method preserves global context without compromising the structural integrity of the learned manifolds. We achieve state-of-the-art results on safe image generation benchmarks, while offering controllable variation of model safety. We identify trade-offs between safety and censorship, which presents a necessary perspective in the development of ethical AI models. We will release our code.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Liang, JunSheng Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Fires can cause severe damage to heritage buildings, making timely fire detection essential. Traditional dense cabling and drilling can harm these structures, so reducing the number of cameras to minimize such impact is challenging. Additionally, avoiding false alarms due to noise sensitivity and preserving the expertise of managers in fire-prone areas is crucial. To address these needs, we propose a fire detection method based on indirect vision, called Mirror Target YOLO (MITA-YOLO). MITA-YOLO integrates indirect vision deployment and an enhanced detection module. It uses mirror angles to achieve indirect views, solving issues with limited visibility in irregular spaces and aligning each indirect view with the target monitoring area. The Target-Mask module is designed to automatically identify and isolate the indirect vision areas in each image, filtering out non-target areas. This enables the model to inherit managers' expertise in assessing fire-risk zones, improving focus and resistance to interference in fire detection.In our experiments, we created an 800-image fire dataset with indirect vision. Results show that MITA-YOLO significantly reduces camera requirements while achieving superior detection performance compared to other mainstream models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has offered innovative perspectives for accelerating the discovery of new functional materials, leveraging the increasing availability of material databases. Despite the promising advances, data-driven methods face constraints imposed by the quantity and quality of available data. Moreover, ML is often employed in tandem with simulated datasets originating from density functional theory (DFT), and assessed through in-sample evaluation schemes. This scenario raises questions about the practical utility of ML in uncovering new and significant material classes for industrial applications. Here, we propose a data-driven framework aimed at accelerating the discovery of new transparent conducting materials (TCMs), an important category of semiconductors with a wide range of applications. To mitigate the shortage of available data, we create and validate unique experimental databases, comprising several examples of existing TCMs. We assess state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML models for property prediction from the stoichiometry alone. We propose a bespoke evaluation scheme to provide empirical evidence on the ability of ML to uncover new, previously unseen materials of interest. We test our approach on a list of 55 compositions containing typical elements of known TCMs. Although our study indicates that ML tends to identify new TCMs compositionally similar to those in the training data, we empirically demonstrate that it can highlight material candidates that may have been previously overlooked, offering a systematic approach to identify materials that are likely to display TCMs characteristics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly revolutionized medical diagnostics and treatment planning, progressing from early X-ray usage to sophisticated methods like MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds. This paper investigates the use of deep learning for medical image captioning, with a particular focus on uterine ultrasound images. These images are vital in obstetrics and gynecology for diagnosing and monitoring various conditions across different age groups. However, their interpretation is often challenging due to their complexity and variability. To address this, a deep learning-based medical image captioning system was developed, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks with a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit network. This hybrid model processes both image and text features to generate descriptive captions for uterine ultrasound images. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach over baseline methods, with the proposed model achieving superior performance in generating accurate and informative captions, as indicated by higher BLEU and ROUGE scores. By enhancing the interpretation of uterine ultrasound images, our research aims to assist medical professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses, ultimately contributing to improved patient care.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. While existing benchmarks for evaluating LMMs mainly focus on image comprehension, few works evaluate them from the image generation perspective. To address this issue, we propose a straightforward automated evaluation pipeline. Specifically, this pipeline requires LMMs to generate an image-prompt from a given input image. Subsequently, it employs text-to-image generative models to create a new image based on these generated prompts. Finally, we evaluate the performance of LMMs by comparing the original image with the generated one. Furthermore, we introduce MMGenBench-Test, a comprehensive benchmark developed to evaluate LMMs across 13 distinct image patterns, and MMGenBench-Domain, targeting the performance evaluation of LMMs within the generative image domain. A thorough evaluation involving over 50 popular LMMs demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability in both the pipeline and benchmark. Our observations indicate that numerous LMMs excelling in existing benchmarks fail to adequately complete the basic tasks, related to image understanding and description. This finding highlights the substantial potential for performance improvement in current LMMs and suggests avenues for future model optimization. Concurrently, our pipeline facilitates the efficient assessment of LMMs performance across diverse domains by using solely image inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in LLMs and generative models in computer vision. Especially one can use multiple of these during inference to change the behavior of the base model. In this paper we investigated whether multiple LoRA adapters trained on computer vision tasks can be merged together and used during inference without loss in performance. By achieving this, multitask models can be created just by merging different LoRAs. Merging these will reduce inference time and it will not require any additional retraining. We have trained adapters on six different tasks and evaluated their performance when they are merged together. For comparison we used a model with a frozen backbone and finetuned its head. Our results show that even with simple merging techniques creating a multitask model by merging adapters is achievable by slightly loosing performance in some cases. In our experiments we merged up to three adapters together. Depending on the task and the similarity of the data adapters were trained on, merges can outperform head finetuning. We have observed that LoRAs trained with dissimilar datasets tend to perform better compared to model trained on similar datasets.</p>

In this paper, we explore the use of Meta-Learning to overcome this domain shift using a minimal amount of data.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive proficiency across a range of natural language processing tasks yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics, which suffer from limited generalizability. While being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural jailbreak prompts that are easy to detect by safety filters or require high computational overhead due to discrete token optimization. Witnessing the limitations of existing jailbreak methods, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel framework that combines human-readable prompt generation with Latent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) to improve adversarial suffix creation in a fully black-box setting. GASP leverages LBO to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the model to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence through a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Our experiments show that GASP can generate natural jailbreak prompts, significantly improving attack success rates, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinghao Zhang, Yue Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank regularization-based deep unrolling networks have achieved remarkable success in various inverse imaging problems (IIPs). However, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is non-differentiable when duplicated singular values occur, leading to severe numerical instability during training. In this paper, we propose a differentiable SVD based on the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to address this issue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a comprehensive analysis of the differentiability of the trivial SVD. Specifically, we show that the non-differentiability of SVD is essentially due to an underdetermined system of linear equations arising in the derivation process. We utilize the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to solve the system, thereby proposing a differentiable SVD. A numerical stability analysis in the context of IIPs is provided. Experimental results in color image compressed sensing and dynamic MRI reconstruction show that our proposed differentiable SVD can effectively address the numerical instability issue while ensuring computational precision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahsa Sheikholeslami, Navid Mazrouei, Yousof Gheisari, Afshin Fasihi, Matin Irajpour, Ali Motahharynia</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional drug design faces significant challenges due to inherent chemical and biological complexities, often resulting in high failure rates in clinical trials. Deep learning advancements, particularly generative models, offer potential solutions to these challenges. One promising algorithm is DrugGPT, a transformer-based model, that generates small molecules for input protein sequences. Although promising, it generates both chemically valid and invalid structures and does not incorporate the features of approved drugs, resulting in time-consuming and inefficient drug discovery. To address these issues, we introduce DrugGen, an enhanced model based on the DrugGPT structure. DrugGen is fine-tuned on approved drug-target interactions and optimized with proximal policy optimization. By giving reward feedback from protein-ligand binding affinity prediction using pre-trained transformers (PLAPT) and a customized invalid structure assessor, DrugGen significantly improves performance. Evaluation across multiple targets demonstrated that DrugGen achieves 100% valid structure generation compared to 95.5% with DrugGPT and produced molecules with higher predicted binding affinities (7.22 [6.30-8.07]) compared to DrugGPT (5.81 [4.97-6.63]) while maintaining diversity and novelty. Docking simulations further validate its ability to generate molecules targeting binding sites effectively. For example, in the case of fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), DrugGen generated molecules with superior docking scores (FABP5/11, -9.537 and FABP5/5, -8.399) compared to the reference molecule (Palmitic acid, -6.177). Beyond lead compound generation, DrugGen also shows potential for drug repositioning and creating novel pharmacophores for existing targets. By producing high-quality small molecules, DrugGen provides a high-performance medium for advancing pharmaceutical research and drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Jiang, Weizhe Huang, Tongxuan Liu, Yuting Zeng, Jing Li, Lechao Cheng, Xiaohua Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) represent a significant advancement toward achieving superior multimodal capabilities by enabling powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand visual input. Typically, LVLMs utilize visual encoders, such as CLIP, to transform images into visual tokens, which are then aligned with textual tokens through projection layers before being input into the LLM for inference. Although existing LVLMs have achieved significant success, their inference efficiency is still limited by the substantial number of visual tokens and the potential redundancy among them. To mitigate this issue, we propose Focal Pruning (FoPru), a training-free method that prunes visual tokens based on the attention-based token significance derived from the vision encoder. Specifically, we introduce two alternative pruning strategies: 1) the rank strategy, which leverages all token significance scores to retain more critical tokens in a global view; 2) the row strategy, which focuses on preserving continuous key information in images from a local perspective. Finally, the selected tokens are reordered to maintain their original positional relationships. Extensive experiments across various LVLMs and multimodal datasets demonstrate that our method can prune a large number of redundant tokens while maintaining high accuracy, leading to significant improvements in inference efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic image generation is no longer just of interest to researchers, but also to practitioners. However, current models are sensitive to the settings used and automatic optimization methods often require human involvement. To bridge this gap, we introduce ComfyGI, a novel approach to automatically improve workflows for image generation without the need for human intervention driven by techniques from genetic improvement. This enables image generation with significantly higher quality in terms of the alignment with the given description and the perceived aesthetics. On the performance side, we find that overall, the images generated with an optimized workflow are about 50% better compared to the initial workflow in terms of the median ImageReward score. These already good results are even surpassed in our human evaluation, as the participants preferred the images improved by ComfyGI in around 90% of the cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scientific progress depends on researchers' ability to synthesize the growing body of literature. Can large language models (LMs) assist scientists in this task? We introduce OpenScholar, a specialized retrieval-augmented LM that answers scientific queries by identifying relevant passages from 45 million open-access papers and synthesizing citation-backed responses. To evaluate OpenScholar, we develop ScholarQABench, the first large-scale multi-domain benchmark for literature search, comprising 2,967 expert-written queries and 208 long-form answers across computer science, physics, neuroscience, and biomedicine. On ScholarQABench, OpenScholar-8B outperforms GPT-4o by 5% and PaperQA2 by 7% in correctness, despite being a smaller, open model. While GPT4o hallucinates citations 78 to 90% of the time, OpenScholar achieves citation accuracy on par with human experts. OpenScholar's datastore, retriever, and self-feedback inference loop also improves off-the-shelf LMs: for instance, OpenScholar-GPT4o improves GPT-4o's correctness by 12%. In human evaluations, experts preferred OpenScholar-8B and OpenScholar-GPT4o responses over expert-written ones 51% and 70% of the time, respectively, compared to GPT4o's 32%. We open-source all of our code, models, datastore, data and a public demo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeqing Wang, Qingyang Ma, Wentao Wan, Haojie Li, Keze Wang, Yonghong Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent improvements in visual synthesis have significantly enhanced the depiction of generated human photos, which are pivotal due to their wide applicability and demand. Nonetheless, the existing text-to-image or text-to-video models often generate low-quality human photos that might differ considerably from real-world body structures, referred to as "abnormal human bodies". Such abnormalities, typically deemed unacceptable, pose considerable challenges in the detection and repair of them within human photos. These challenges require precise abnormality recognition capabilities, which entail pinpointing both the location and the abnormality type. Intuitively, Visual Language Models (VLMs) that have obtained remarkable performance on various visual tasks are quite suitable for this task. However, their performance on abnormality detection in human photos is quite poor. Hence, it is quite important to highlight this task for the research community. In this paper, we first introduce a simple yet challenging task, i.e., \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{H}uman-body \textbf{A}bnormality \textbf{D}etection \textbf{(FHAD)}, and construct two high-quality datasets for evaluation. Then, we propose a meticulous framework, named HumanCalibrator, which identifies and repairs abnormalities in human body structures while preserving the other content. Experiments indicate that our HumanCalibrator achieves high accuracy in abnormality detection and accomplishes an increase in visual comparisons while preserving the other visual content.</p>

<p>Abstract: This contribution introduces a dataset of 7th-order Ambisonic Room Impulse Responses (HOA-RIRs), created using the Image Source Method. By employing higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio applications. Leveraging the virtual simulation, we present a unique microphone configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio, particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room acoustics modeling and sound field synthesis. It further provides a very high level of spatial resolution and realism crucial for tasks such as source localization, reverberation prediction, and immersive sound reproduction.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14215">Evaluating the Robustness of Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Martha Lewis, Melanie Mitchell</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have performed well on several reasoning benchmarks, including ones that test analogical reasoning abilities. However, there is debate on the extent to which they are performing general abstract reasoning versus employing non-robust processes, e.g., that overly rely on similarity to pre-training data. Here we investigate the robustness of analogy-making abilities previously claimed for LLMs on three of four domains studied by Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023): letter-string analogies, digit matrices, and story analogies. For each domain we test humans and GPT models on robustness to variants of the original analogy problems that test the same abstract reasoning abilities but are likely dissimilar from tasks in the pre-training data. The performance of a system that uses robust abstract reasoning should not decline substantially on these variants.
  On simple letter-string analogies, we find that while the performance of humans remains high for two types of variants we tested, the GPT models' performance declines sharply. This pattern is less pronounced as the complexity of these problems is increased, as both humans and GPT models perform poorly on both the original and variant problems requiring more complex analogies. On digit-matrix problems, we find a similar pattern but only on one out of the two types of variants we tested. On story-based analogy problems, we find that, unlike humans, the performance of GPT models are susceptible to answer-order effects, and that GPT models also may be more sensitive than humans to paraphrasing.
  This work provides evidence that LLMs often lack the robustness of zero-shot human analogy-making, exhibiting brittleness on most of the variations we tested. More generally, this work points to the importance of carefully evaluating AI systems not only for accuracy but also robustness when testing their cognitive capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Fergus, Carl Chalmers, Naomi Matthews, Stuart Nixon, Andre Burger, Oliver Hartley, Chris Sutherland, Xavier Lambin, Steven Longmore, Serge Wich</p>
<p>Abstract: Camera traps offer enormous new opportunities in ecological studies, but current automated image analysis methods often lack the contextual richness needed to support impactful conservation outcomes. Here we present an integrated approach that combines deep learning-based vision and language models to improve ecological reporting using data from camera traps. We introduce a two-stage system: YOLOv10-X to localise and classify species (mammals and birds) within images, and a Phi-3.5-vision-instruct model to read YOLOv10-X binding box labels to identify species, overcoming its limitation with hard to classify objects in images. Additionally, Phi-3.5 detects broader variables, such as vegetation type, and time of day, providing rich ecological and environmental context to YOLO's species detection output. When combined, this output is processed by the model's natural language system to answer complex queries, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is employed to enrich responses with external information, like species weight and IUCN status (information that cannot be obtained through direct visual analysis). This information is used to automatically generate structured reports, providing biodiversity stakeholders with deeper insights into, for example, species abundance, distribution, animal behaviour, and habitat selection. Our approach delivers contextually rich narratives that aid in wildlife management decisions. By providing contextually rich insights, our approach not only reduces manual effort but also supports timely decision-making in conservation, potentially shifting efforts from reactive to proactive management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Lu, Junjie Shan, Ziqi Zhao, Ka-Ho Chow</p>
<p>Abstract: As object detection becomes integral to many safety-critical applications, understanding its vulnerabilities is essential. Backdoor attacks, in particular, pose a significant threat by implanting hidden backdoor in a victim model, which adversaries can later exploit to trigger malicious behaviors during inference. However, current backdoor techniques are limited to static scenarios where attackers must define a malicious objective before training, locking the attack into a predetermined action without inference-time adaptability. Given the expressive output space in object detection, including object existence detection, bounding box estimation, and object classification, the feasibility of implanting a backdoor that provides inference-time control with a high degree of freedom remains unexplored. This paper introduces AnywhereDoor, a flexible backdoor attack tailored for object detection. Once implanted, AnywhereDoor enables adversaries to specify different attack types (object vanishing, fabrication, or misclassification) and configurations (untargeted or targeted with specific classes) to dynamically control detection behavior. This flexibility is achieved through three key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to support a broader range of attack combinations well beyond what existing methods allow; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure backdoor activations are robust, even against those object detectors that extract localized regions from the input image for recognition; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level data imbalances that otherwise hinders a balanced manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnywhereDoor provides attackers with a high degree of control, achieving an attack success rate improvement of nearly 80% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such flexible control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) mathematically formulates decision-making with Markov Decision Process (MDP). With MDPs, researchers have achieved remarkable breakthroughs across various domains, including games, robotics, and language models. This paper seeks a new possibility, Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), by extending traditional MDP to natural language-based representation space. Specifically, NLRL innovatively redefines RL principles, including task objectives, policy, value function, Bellman equation, and policy iteration, into their language counterparts. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value improvement by either pure prompting or gradient-based training. Experiments over Maze, Breakthrough, and Tic-Tac-Toe games demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of the NLRL framework among diverse use cases.

<p>Abstract: Generating large-scale, domain-specific, multilingual multi-turn dialogue datasets remains a significant hurdle for training effective Multi-Turn Intent Classification models in chatbot systems. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Intent, a novel mechanism that combines Hidden Markov Models with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate contextually aware, intent-driven conversations through self-play. By extracting domain-specific knowledge from e-commerce chat logs, we estimate conversation turns and intent transitions, which guide the generation of coherent dialogues. Leveraging LLMs to enhance emission probabilities, our approach produces natural and contextually consistent questions and answers. We also propose MINT-CL, a framework for multi-turn intent classification using multi-task contrastive learning, improving classification accuracy without the need for extensive annotated data. Evaluations show that our methods outperform baselines in dialogue quality and intent classification accuracy, especially in multilingual settings, while significantly reducing data generation efforts. Furthermore, we release MINT-E, a multilingual, intent-aware multi-turn e-commerce dialogue corpus to support future research in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Course Outcome (CO) and Program Outcome (PO)/Program-Specific Outcome (PSO) alignment is a crucial task for ensuring curriculum coherence and assessing educational effectiveness. The construction of a Course Articulation Matrix (CAM), which quantifies the relationship between COs and POs/PSOs, typically involves assigning numerical values (0, 1, 2, 3) to represent the degree of alignment. In this study, We experiment with four models from the BERT family: BERT Base, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa, and use multiclass classification to assess the alignment between CO and PO/PSO pairs. We first evaluate traditional machine learning classifiers, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and then apply transfer learning to evaluate the performance of the pretrained BERT models. To enhance model interpretability, we apply Explainable AI technique, specifically Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), to provide transparency into the decision-making process. Our system achieves accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values of 98.66%, 98.67%, 98.66%, and 98.66%, respectively. This work demonstrates the potential of utilizing transfer learning with BERT-based models for the automated generation of CAMs, offering high performance and interpretability in educational outcome assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Ferrando, Oscar Obeso, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models are a widespread problem, yet the mechanisms behind whether models will hallucinate are poorly understood, limiting our ability to solve this problem. Using sparse autoencoders as an interpretability tool, we discover that a key part of these mechanisms is entity recognition, where the model detects if an entity is one it can recall facts about. Sparse autoencoders uncover meaningful directions in the representation space, these detect whether the model recognizes an entity, e.g. detecting it doesn't know about an athlete or a movie. This suggests that models can have self-knowledge: internal representations about their own capabilities. These directions are causally relevant: capable of steering the model to refuse to answer questions about known entities, or to hallucinate attributes of unknown entities when it would otherwise refuse. We demonstrate that despite the sparse autoencoders being trained on the base model, these directions have a causal effect on the chat model's refusal behavior, suggesting that chat finetuning has repurposed this existing mechanism. Furthermore, we provide an initial exploration into the mechanistic role of these directions in the model, finding that they disrupt the attention of downstream heads that typically move entity attributes to the final token.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) based applications including automated text generation, question answering, chatbots, and others. However, they face a significant challenge: hallucinations, where models produce plausible-sounding but factually incorrect responses. This undermines trust and limits the applicability of LLMs in different domains. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), on the other hand, provide a structured collection of interconnected facts represented as entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). In recent research, KGs have been leveraged to provide context that can fill gaps in an LLM understanding of certain topics offering a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, enhancing their reliability and accuracy while benefiting from their wide applicability. Nonetheless, it is still a very active area of research with various unresolved open problems. In this paper, we discuss these open challenges covering state-of-the-art datasets and benchmarks as well as methods for knowledge integration and evaluating hallucinations. In our discussion, we consider the current use of KGs in LLM systems and identify future directions within each of these challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Stevens, Jari Peeperkorn, Johannes De Smedt, Jochen De Weerdt</p>
<p>Abstract: In predictive process monitoring, predictive models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where input perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions. Unlike in computer vision, where these perturbations are designed to be imperceptible to the human eye, the generation of adversarial examples in predictive process monitoring poses unique challenges. Minor changes to the activity sequences can create improbable or even impossible scenarios to occur due to underlying constraints such as regulatory rules or process constraints. To address this, we focus on generating realistic adversarial examples tailored to the business process context, in contrast to the imperceptible, pixel-level changes commonly seen in computer vision adversarial attacks. This paper introduces two novel latent space attacks, which generate adversaries by adding noise to the latent space representation of the input data, rather than directly modifying the input attributes. These latent space methods are domain-agnostic and do not rely on process-specific knowledge, as we restrict the generation of adversarial examples to the learned class-specific data distributions by directly perturbing the latent space representation of the business process executions. We evaluate these two latent space methods with six other adversarial attacking methods on eleven real-life event logs and four predictive models. The first three attacking methods directly permute the activities of the historically observed business process executions. The fourth method constrains the adversarial examples to lie within the same data distribution as the original instances, by projecting the adversarial examples to the original data distribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: This chapter delves into the emerging field of neuro-symbolic query optimization for knowledge graphs (KGs), presenting a comprehensive exploration of how neural and symbolic techniques can be integrated to enhance query processing. Traditional query optimizers in knowledge graphs rely heavily on symbolic methods, utilizing dataset summaries, statistics, and cost models to select efficient execution plans. However, these approaches often suffer from misestimations and inaccuracies, particularly when dealing with complex queries or large-scale datasets. Recent advancements have introduced neural models, which capture non-linear aspects of query optimization, offering promising alternatives to purely symbolic methods. In this chapter, we introduce neuro-symbolic query optimizers, a novel approach that combines the strengths of symbolic reasoning with the adaptability of neural computation. We discuss the architecture of these hybrid systems, highlighting the interplay between neural and symbolic components to improve the optimizer's ability to navigate the search space and produce efficient execution plans. Additionally, the chapter reviews existing neural components tailored for optimizing queries over knowledge graphs and examines the limitations and challenges in deploying neuro-symbolic query optimizers in real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor-Alexandru P\u{a}durean, Paul Denny, Adish Singla</p>
<p>Abstract: Debugging is an essential skill when learning to program, yet its instruction and emphasis often vary widely across introductory courses. In the era of code-generating large language models (LLMs), the ability for students to reason about code and identify errors is increasingly important. However, students frequently resort to trial-and-error methods to resolve bugs without fully understanding the underlying issues. Developing the ability to identify and hypothesize the cause of bugs is crucial but can be time-consuming to teach effectively through traditional means. This paper introduces BugSpotter, an innovative tool that leverages an LLM to generate buggy code from a problem description and verify the synthesized bugs via a test suite. Students interact with BugSpotter by designing failing test cases, where the buggy code's output differs from the expected result as defined by the problem specification. This not only provides opportunities for students to enhance their debugging skills, but also to practice reading and understanding problem specifications. We deployed BugSpotter in a large classroom setting and compared the debugging exercises it generated to exercises hand-crafted by an instructor for the same problems. We found that the LLM-generated exercises produced by BugSpotter varied in difficulty and were well-matched to the problem specifications. Importantly, the LLM-generated exercises were comparable to those manually created by instructors with respect to student performance, suggesting that BugSpotter could be an effective and efficient aid for learning debugging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esther Rolf, Lucia Gordon, Milind Tambe, Andrew Davies</p>
<p>Abstract: While advances in machine learning with satellite imagery (SatML) are facilitating environmental monitoring at a global scale, developing SatML models that are accurate and useful for local regions remains critical to understanding and acting on an ever-changing planet. As increasing attention and resources are being devoted to training SatML models with global data, it is important to understand when improvements in global models will make it easier to train or fine-tune models that are accurate in specific regions. To explore this question, we contrast local and global training paradigms for SatML through a case study of tree canopy height (TCH) mapping in the Karingani Game Reserve, Mozambique. We find that recent advances in global TCH mapping do not necessarily translate to better local modeling abilities in our study region. Specifically, small models trained only with locally-collected data outperform published global TCH maps, and even outperform globally pretrained models that we fine-tune using local data. Analyzing these results further, we identify specific points of conflict and synergy between local and global modeling paradigms that can inform future research toward aligning local and global performance objectives in geospatial machine learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Formal verification of robotic applications presents challenges due to their hybrid nature and distributed architecture. This paper introduces ROSMonitoring 2.0, an extension of ROSMonitoring designed to facilitate the monitoring of both topics and services while considering the order in which messages are published and received. The framework has been enhanced to support these novel features for ROS1 -- and partially ROS2 environments -- offering improved real-time support, security, scalability, and interoperability. We discuss the modifications made to accommodate these advancements and present results obtained from a case study involving the runtime monitoring of specific components of a fire-fighting Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Till Schnittka (University of Bremen), Mario Gleirscher (University of Bremen)</p>
<p>Abstract: When designing correct-by-construction controllers for autonomous collectives, three key challenges are the task specification, the modelling, and its use at practical scale. In this paper, we focus on a simple yet useful abstraction for high-level controller synthesis for robot collectives with optimisation goals (e.g., maximum cleanliness, minimum energy consumption) and recurrence (e.g., re-establish contamination and charge thresholds) and safety (e.g., avoid full discharge, mutually exclusive room occupation) constraints. Due to technical limitations (related to scalability and using constraints in the synthesis), we simplify our graph-based setting from a stochastic two-player game into a single-player game on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Robustness against environmental uncertainty is encoded via partial observability. Linear-time correctness properties are verified separately after synthesising the POMDP strategy. We contribute at-scale guidance on POMDP modelling and controller synthesis for tasked robot collectives exemplified by the scenario of battery-driven robots responsible for cleaning public buildings with utilisation constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: The certification of autonomous systems is an important concern in science and industry. The KI-LOK project explores new methods for certifying and safely integrating AI components into autonomous trains. We pursued a two-layered approach: (1) ensuring the safety of the steering system by formal analysis using the B method, and (2) improving the reliability of the perception system with a runtime certificate checker. This work links both strategies within a demonstrator that runs simulations on the formal model, controlled by the real AI output and the real certificate checker. The demonstrator is integrated into the validation tool ProB. This enables runtime monitoring, runtime verification, and statistical validation of formal safety properties using a formal B model. Consequently, one can detect and analyse potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the AI and the certificate checker. We apply these techniques to a signal detection case study and present our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Xiang, Drake Essick, Luiz Gonzalez Bautista, Junfei Xie, Jun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Models for trajectory prediction are an essential component of many advanced air mobility studies. These models help aircraft detect conflict and plan avoidance maneuvers, which is especially important in Unmanned Aircraft systems (UAS) landing management due to the congested airspace near vertiports. In this paper, we propose a landing trajectory prediction model for UAS based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is a prestigious neural network that has been developed for many years. In previous research, GAN has achieved many state-of-the-art results in many generation tasks. The GAN consists of one neural network generator and a neural network discriminator. Because of the learning capacity of the neural networks, the generator is capable to understand the features of the sample trajectory. The generator takes the previous trajectory as input and outputs some random status of a flight. According to the results of the experiences, the proposed model can output more accurate predictions than the baseline method(GMR) in various datasets. To evaluate the proposed model, we also create a real UAV landing dataset that includes more than 2600 trajectories of drone control manually by real pilots.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritwik Gupta, Leah Walker, Andrew W. Reddie</p>
<p>Abstract: U.S. export controls on semiconductors are widely known to be permeable, with the People's Republic of China (PRC) steadily creating state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) models with exfiltrated chips. This paper presents the first concrete, public evidence of how leading PRC AI labs evade and circumvent U.S. export controls. We examine how Chinese companies, notably Tencent, are not only using chips that are restricted under U.S. export controls but are also finding ways to circumvent these regulations by using software and modeling techniques that maximize less capable hardware. Specifically, we argue that Tencent's ability to power its Hunyuan-Large model with non-export controlled NVIDIA H20s exemplifies broader gains in efficiency in machine learning that have eroded the moat that the United States initially built via its existing export controls. Finally, we examine the implications of this finding for the future of the United States' export control strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhu, Xinjiang Wang, Wayne Zhang, Rynson W. H. Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutions (Convs) and multi-head self-attentions (MHSAs) are typically considered alternatives to each other for building vision backbones. Although some works try to integrate both, they apply the two operators simultaneously at the finest pixel granularity. With Convs responsible for per-pixel feature extraction already, the question is whether we still need to include the heavy MHSAs at such a fine-grained level. In fact, this is the root cause of the scalability issue w.r.t. the input resolution for vision transformers. To address this important problem, we propose in this work to use MSHAs and Convs in parallel \textbf{at different granularity levels} instead. Specifically, in each layer, we use two different ways to represent an image: a fine-grained regular grid and a coarse-grained set of semantic slots. We apply different operations to these two representations: Convs to the grid for local features, and MHSAs to the slots for global features. A pair of fully differentiable soft clustering and dispatching modules is introduced to bridge the grid and set representations, thus enabling local-global fusion. Through extensive experiments on various vision tasks, we empirically verify the potential of the proposed integration scheme, named \textit{GLMix}: by offloading the burden of fine-grained features to light-weight Convs, it is sufficient to use MHSAs in a few (e.g., 64) semantic slots to match the performance of recent state-of-the-art backbones, while being more efficient. Our visualization results also demonstrate that the soft clustering module produces a meaningful semantic grouping effect with only IN1k classification supervision, which may induce better interpretability and inspire new weakly-supervised semantic segmentation approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Li, Damien Teney, Linyi Yang, Qingsong Wen, Xing Xie, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cultural bias is pervasive in many large language models (LLMs), largely due to the deficiency of data representative of different cultures. Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sania Sinha, Tanawan Premsri, Parisa Kordjamshidi</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional learning, mastering the ability to combine basic concepts and construct more intricate ones, is crucial for human cognition, especially in human language comprehension and visual perception. This notion is tightly connected to generalization over unobserved situations. Despite its integral role in intelligence, there is a lack of systematic theoretical and experimental research methodologies, making it difficult to analyze the compositional learning abilities of computational models. In this paper, we survey the literature on compositional learning of AI models and the connections made to cognitive studies. We identify abstract concepts of compositionality in cognitive and linguistic studies and connect these to the computational challenges faced by language and vision models in compositional reasoning. We overview the formal definitions, tasks, evaluation benchmarks, various computational models, and theoretical findings. Our primary focus is on linguistic benchmarks and combining language and vision, though there is a large amount of research on compositional concept learning in the computer vision community alone. We cover modern studies on large language models to provide a deeper understanding of the cutting-edge compositional capabilities exhibited by state-of-the-art AI models and pinpoint important directions for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an advanced mathematical problem-solving framework, LLaMA-Berry, for enhancing the mathematical reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with iterative Self-Refine to optimize the reasoning path and utilizes a pairwise reward model to evaluate different paths globally. By leveraging the self-critic and rewriting capabilities of LLMs, Self-Refine applied to MCTS (SR-MCTS) overcomes the inefficiencies and limitations of conventional step-wise and greedy search algorithms by fostering a more efficient exploration of solution spaces. Pairwise Preference Reward Model~(PPRM), inspired by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), is then used to model pairwise preferences between solutions, utilizing an Enhanced Borda Count (EBC) method to synthesize these preferences into a global ranking score to find better answers. This approach addresses the challenges of scoring variability and non-independent distributions in mathematical reasoning tasks. The framework has been tested on general and advanced benchmarks, showing superior performance in terms of search efficiency and problem-solving capability compared to existing methods like ToT and rStar, particularly in complex Olympiad-level benchmarks, including GPQA, AIME24 and AMC23.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emery Cooper, Caspar Oesterheld, Vincent Conitzer</p>
<p>Abstract: In Newcomb's problem, causal decision theory (CDT) recommends two-boxing and thus comes apart from evidential decision theory (EDT) and ex ante policy optimisation (which prescribe one-boxing). However, in Newcomb's problem, you should perhaps believe that with some probability you are in a simulation run by the predictor to determine whether to put a million dollars into the opaque box. If so, then causal decision theory might recommend one-boxing in order to cause the predictor to fill the opaque box. In this paper, we study generalisations of this approach. That is, we consider general Newcomblike problems and try to form reasonable self-locating beliefs under which CDT's recommendations align with an EDT-like notion of ex ante policy optimisation. We consider approaches in which we model the world as running simulations of the agent, and an approach not based on such models (which we call 'Generalised Generalised Thirding', or GGT). For each approach, we characterise the resulting CDT policies, and prove that under certain conditions, these include the ex ante optimal policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current forecasting approaches are largely unimodal and ignore the rich textual data that often accompany the time series due to lack of well-curated multimodal benchmark dataset. In this work, we develop TimeText Corpus (TTC), a carefully curated, time-aligned text and time dataset for multimodal forecasting. Our dataset is composed of sequences of numbers and text aligned to timestamps, and includes data from two different domains: climate science and healthcare. Our data is a significant contribution to the rare selection of available multimodal datasets. We also propose the Hybrid Multi-Modal Forecaster (Hybrid-MMF), a multimodal LLM that jointly forecasts both text and time series data using shared embeddings. However, contrary to our expectations, our Hybrid-MMF model does not outperform existing baselines in our experiments. This negative result highlights the challenges inherent in multimodal forecasting. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/Multimodal_ Forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erfaun Noorani, Christos Mavridis, John Baras</p>
<p>Abstract: While reinforcement learning has shown experimental success in a number of applications, it is known to be sensitive to noise and perturbations in the parameters of the system, leading to high variance in the total reward amongst different episodes in slightly different environments. To introduce robustness, as well as sample efficiency, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning methods are being thoroughly studied. In this work, we provide a definition of robust reinforcement learning policies and formulate a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning problem to approximate them, by solving an optimization problem with respect to a modified objective based on exponential criteria. In particular, we study a model-free risk-sensitive variation of the widely-used Monte Carlo Policy Gradient algorithm and introduce a novel risk-sensitive online Actor-Critic algorithm based on solving a multiplicative Bellman equation using stochastic approximation updates. Analytical results suggest that the use of exponential criteria generalizes commonly used ad-hoc regularization approaches, improves sample efficiency, and introduces robustness with respect to perturbations in the model parameters and the environment. The implementation, performance, and robustness properties of the proposed methods are evaluated in simulated experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Sharma, Sonali Parbhoo, Omer Gottesman, Finale Doshi-Velez</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) provides a way to learn a transition model of the environment, which can then be used to plan personalized policies for different patient cohorts and to understand the dynamics involved in the decision-making process. However, standard MBRL algorithms are either sensitive to changes in the reward function or achieve suboptimal performance on the task when the transition model is restricted. Motivated by the need to use simple and interpretable models in critical domains such as healthcare, we propose a novel robust decision-focused (RDF) algorithm that learns a transition model that achieves high returns while being robust to changes in the reward function. We demonstrate our RDF algorithm can be used with several model classes and planning algorithms. We also provide theoretical and empirical evidence, on a variety of simulators and real patient data, that RDF can learn simple yet effective models that can be used to plan personalized policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has been instrumental in enabling joint transceiver optimization by merging all physical layer blocks of the end-to-end wireless communication systems. Although there have been a number of adversarial attacks on ML-based wireless systems, the existing methods do not provide a comprehensive view including multi-modality of the source data, common physical layer protocols, and wireless domain constraints. This paper proposes Magmaw, a novel wireless attack methodology capable of generating universal adversarial perturbations for any multimodal signal transmitted over a wireless channel. We further introduce new objectives for adversarial attacks on downstream applications. We adopt the widely-used defenses to verify the resilience of Magmaw. For proof-of-concept evaluation, we build a real-time wireless attack platform using a software-defined radio system. Experimental results demonstrate that Magmaw causes significant performance degradation even in the presence of strong defense mechanisms. Furthermore, we validate the performance of Magmaw in two case studies: encrypted communication channel and channel modality-based ML model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyao Zhou, Yuanlun Xie, Yiqin Fu, Zhaokun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in the wild is a challenging task affected by the image quality and has attracted broad interest in computer vision. There is no research using feature fusion and ensemble strategy for FER simultaneously. Different from previous studies, this paper applies both internal feature fusion for a single model and feature fusion among multiple networks, as well as the ensemble strategy. This paper proposes one novel single model named R18+FAML, as well as one ensemble model named R18+FAML-FGA-T2V to improve the performance of the FER in the wild. Based on the structure of ResNet18 (R18), R18+FAML combines internal Feature fusion and three Attention blocks using Multiple Loss functions (FAML) to improve the diversity of the feature extraction. To improve the performance of R18+FAML, we propose a Feature fusion among networks based on the Genetic Algorithm (FGA), which can fuse the convolution kernels for feature extraction of multiple networks. On the basis of R18+FAML and FGA, we propose one ensemble strategy, i.e., the Top Two Voting (T2V) to support the classification of FER, which can consider more classification information comprehensively. Combining the above strategies, R18+FAML-FGA-T2V can focus on the main expression-aware areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our single model R18+FAML and the ensemble model R18+FAML-FGA-T2V achieve the accuracies of $\left( 90.32, 62.17, 65.83 \right)\%$ and $\left( 91.59, 63.27, 66.63 \right)\%$ on three challenging unbalanced FER datasets RAF-DB, AffectNet-8 and AffectNet-7 respectively, both outperforming the state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Chen, Boxiao Liu, Zeshi Liu, Haihang You</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to the energy-efficient and multiplication-free characteristics. Despite these advantages, deploying large-scale SNNs on edge hardware is challenging due to limited resource availability. Network pruning offers a viable approach to compress the network scale and reduce hardware resource requirements for model deployment. However, existing SNN pruning methods cause high pruning costs and performance loss because they lack efficiency in processing the sparse spike representation of SNNs. In this paper, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience and the high biological plausibility of SNNs, we explore and leverage criticality to facilitate efficient pruning in deep SNNs. We firstly explain criticality in SNNs from the perspective of maximizing feature information entropy. Second, We propose a low-cost metric for assess neuron criticality in feature transmission and design a pruning-regeneration method that incorporates this criticality into the pruning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher performance than the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with up to 95.26\% reduction of pruning cost. The criticality-based regeneration process efficiently selects potential structures and facilitates consistent feature representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan He, Zhangdie Yuan, Jiaoyan Chen, Ian Horrocks</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\'e ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nouar AlDahoul, Talal Rahwan, Yasir Zaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative AI models such as Stable Diffusion are used daily by millions worldwide. However, the extent to which these models exhibit racial and gender stereotypes is not yet fully understood. Here, we document significant biases in Stable Diffusion across six races, two genders, 32 professions, and eight attributes. Additionally, we examine the degree to which Stable Diffusion depicts individuals of the same race as being similar to one another. This analysis reveals significant racial homogenization, e.g., depicting nearly all Middle Eastern men as bearded, brown-skinned, and wearing traditional attire. We then propose debiasing solutions that allow users to specify the desired distributions of race and gender when generating images while minimizing racial homogenization. Finally, using a preregistered survey experiment, we find evidence that being presented with inclusive AI-generated faces reduces people's racial and gender biases, while being presented with non-inclusive ones increases such biases, regardless of whether the images are labeled as AI-generated. Taken together, our findings emphasize the need to address biases and stereotypes in text-to-image models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsuk Kim, Junghwan Lim, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Chae Eun Rhee</p>
<p>Abstract: The model size growth of personalized recommendation systems poses new challenges for inference. Weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed for size reduction, but they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) enhanced the model throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but such algorithms introduce massive CPU-PIM communication into prior PIM systems. We propose ProactivePIM, a PIM system for weight-sharing recommendation system acceleration. ProactivePIM integrates a cache within the PIM with a prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate communication overhead through a subtable mapping strategy. ProactivePIM achieves a 4.8x speedup compared to prior works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinghui Lu, Ziwei Yang, Yanjie Wang, Xuejing Liu, Brian Mac Namee, Can Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study, we aim to reduce generation latency for Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The main cause of high latency in LLMs is the sequential decoding process, which autoregressively generates all labels and mentions for NER, significantly increase the sequence length. To this end, we introduce Parallel Decoding in LLM for NE} (PaDeLLM-NER), a approach that integrates seamlessly into existing generative model frameworks without necessitating additional modules or architectural modifications. PaDeLLM-NER allows for the simultaneous decoding of all mentions, thereby reducing generation latency. Experiments reveal that PaDeLLM-NER significantly increases inference speed that is 1.76 to 10.22 times faster than the autoregressive approach for both English and Chinese. Simultaneously it maintains the quality of predictions as evidenced by the performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art across various datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Wang, Guocheng He, Yiannis Kantaros</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses task planning problems for language-instructed robot teams. Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new distributed LLM-based planner, called S-ATLAS for Safe plAnning for Teams of Language-instructed AgentS, that is capable of achieving user-defined mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a distributed fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates, assuming successful plan execution, while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We provide comparative experiments against related works showing that our method is significantly more computational efficient and achieves lower help rates. The advantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with increasing robot team size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingxu Tao, Quzhe Huang, Kun Xu, Liwei Chen, Yansong Feng, Dongyan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has greatly accelerated the development of applications in understanding integrated texts and images. Recent works leverage image-caption datasets to train MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image-to-text tasks. However, there are few studies exploring which layers of MLLMs make the most effort to the global image information, which plays vital roles in multimodal comprehension and generation. In this study, we find that the intermediate layers of models can encode more global semantic information, whose representation vectors perform better on visual-language entailment tasks, rather than the topmost layers. We further probe models regarding local semantic representations through object recognition tasks. We find that the topmost layers may excessively focus on local information, leading to a diminished ability to encode global information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekaterina Trofimova, Emil Sataev, Andrey E. Ustyuzhanin</p>
<p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of machine learning, seamless translation of natural language descriptions into executable code remains a formidable challenge. This paper introduces Linguacodus, an innovative framework designed to tackle this challenge by deploying a dynamic pipeline that iteratively transforms natural language task descriptions into code through high-level data-shaping instructions. The core of Linguacodus is a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), empowered to evaluate diverse solutions for various problems and select the most fitting one for a given task. This paper details the fine-tuning process, and sheds light on how natural language descriptions can be translated into functional code. Linguacodus represents a substantial leap towards automated code generation, effectively bridging the gap between task descriptions and executable code. It holds great promise for advancing machine learning applications across diverse domains. Additionally, we propose an algorithm capable of transforming a natural description of an ML task into code with minimal human interaction. In extensive experiments on a vast machine learning code dataset originating from Kaggle, we showcase the effectiveness of Linguacodus. The investigations highlight its potential applications across diverse domains, emphasizing its impact on applied machine learning in various scientific fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Pan, Xiang Zhang, Yuguang Yang, Jixun Yao, Yanni Hu, Jianhao Ye, Hongbin Zhou, Lei Ma, Jianjun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural speech codecs have recently emerged as a focal point in the fields of speech compression and generation. Despite this progress, achieving high-quality speech reconstruction under low-bitrate scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose PSCodec, a series of neural speech codecs based on prompt encoders, comprising PSCodec-Base, PSCodec-DRL-ICT, and PSCodec-CasAN, which are capable of delivering high-performance speech reconstruction with low bandwidths. Specifically, we first introduce PSCodec-Base, which leverages a pretrained speaker verification model-based prompt encoder (VPP-Enc) and a learnable Mel-spectrogram-based prompt encoder (MelP-Enc) to effectively disentangle and integrate voiceprint and Mel-related features in utterances. To further enhance feature utilization efficiency, we propose PSCodec-DRL-ICT, incorporating a structural similarity (SSIM) based disentangled representation loss (DRL) and an incremental continuous training (ICT) strategy. While PSCodec-DRL-ICT demonstrates impressive performance, its reliance on extensive hyperparameter tuning and multi-stage training makes it somewhat labor-intensive. To circumvent these limitations, we propose PSCodec-CasAN, utilizing an advanced cascaded attention network (CasAN) to enhance representational capacity of the entire system. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PSCodec-Base, PSCodec-DRL-ICT, and PSCodec-CasAN all significantly outperform several state-of-the-art neural codecs, exhibiting substantial improvements in both speech reconstruction quality and speaker similarity under low-bitrate conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyuan Jiang, Moyang Guo, Yuepeng Hu, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Several companies have deployed watermark-based detection to identify AI-generated content. However, attribution--the ability to trace back to the user of a generative AI (GenAI) service who created a given piece of AI-generated content--remains largely unexplored despite its growing importance. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting the first systematic study on watermark-based, user-level attribution of AI-generated content. Our key idea is to assign a unique watermark to each user of the GenAI service and embed this watermark into the AI-generated content created by that user. Attribution is then performed by identifying the user whose watermark best matches the one extracted from the given content. This approach, however, faces a key challenge: How should watermarks be selected for users to maximize attribution performance? To address the challenge, we first theoretically derive lower bounds on detection and attribution performance through rigorous probabilistic analysis for any given set of user watermarks. Then, we select watermarks for users to maximize these lower bounds, thereby optimizing detection and attribution performance. Our theoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based attribution inherits both the accuracy and (non-)robustness properties of the underlying watermark. Specifically, attribution remains highly accurate when the watermarked AI-generated content is either not post-processed or subjected to common post-processing such as JPEG compression, as well as black-box adversarial post-processing with limited query budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenguang Liu, Chisheng Wang, Feifei Dong, Xiayang Xiao, Xin Su, Chuanhua Zhu, Dejin Zhang, Qingquan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge detection is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent deep learning based algorithms achieve state-of-the-art performance in publicly available datasets. Despite their efficiency, their performance, however, relies heavily on the pre-trained weights of the backbone network on the ImageNet dataset. This significantly limits the design space of deep learning based edge detectors. Whenever we want to devise a new model, we have to train this new model on the ImageNet dataset first, and then fine-tune the model using the edge detection datasets. The comparison would be unfair otherwise. However, it is usually not feasible for many researchers to train a model on the ImageNet dataset due to the limited computation resources. Besides, if these methods need to be trained to detect edges in a different kind of data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for instance, the pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset are unlikely to improve the edge detection accuracy due to the strong differences in the statistics between optical and SAR images. In the meantime, no dataset for SAR image processing matches the size of the ImageNet dataset. In this work, we study the performance achievable by existing methods in publicly available datasets when they are trained from scratch, and devise a new network architecture, the multi-stream and multi-scale fusion net (msmsfnet), for edge detection. We show in our experiments that by training all models from scratch to ensure the fairness of comparison, our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning based edge detectors in three publicly available datasets. The efficiency of our model is further demonstrated by the experiments for edge detection in SAR images, which serves as an important evidence showing the meaningfulness of this work as no useful pre-trained weight is available for edge detection in SAR images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinfeng Li, Zhiqiang Shen, Zhenghan Qin, Yangfan Xie, Xuhong Zhang, Tianyu Du, Jianwei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Proprietary large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied in various scenarios. Additionally, deploying LLMs on edge devices is trending for efficiency and privacy reasons. However, edge deployment of proprietary LLMs introduces new security challenges: edge-deployed models are exposed as white-box accessible to users, enabling adversaries to conduct effective model stealing (MS) attacks. Unfortunately, existing defense mechanisms fail to provide effective protection. Specifically, we identify four critical protection properties that existing methods fail to simultaneously satisfy: (1) maintaining protection after a model is physically copied; (2) authorizing model access at request level; (3) safeguarding runtime reverse engineering; (4) achieving high security with negligible runtime overhead. To address the above issues, we propose TransLinkGuard, a plug-and-play model protection approach against model stealing on edge devices. The core part of TransLinkGuard is a lightweight authorization module residing in a secure environment, e.g., TEE. The authorization module can freshly authorize each request based on its input. Extensive experiments show that TransLinkGuard achieves the same security protection as the black-box security guarantees with negligible overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio A. Serrano, Jose Martinez-Carranza, L. Enrique Sucar</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a framework in which agents can be trained, via trial and error, to solve complex decision-making problems. Learning with little supervision causes RL methods to require large amounts of data, rendering them too expensive for many applications (e.g., robotics). By reusing knowledge from a different task, knowledge transfer methods present an alternative to reduce the training time in RL. Given the severe data scarcity, due to their flexibility, there has been a growing interest in methods capable of transferring knowledge across different domains (i.e., problems with different representations). However, identifying similarities and adapting knowledge across tasks from different domains requires matching their representations or finding domain-invariant features. These processes can be data-demanding, which poses the main challenge in cross-domain knowledge transfer: to select and transform knowledge in a data-efficient way, such that it accelerates learning in the target task, despite the presence of significant differences across problems (e.g., robots with distinct morphologies). Thus, this review presents a unifying analysis of methods focused on transferring knowledge across different domains. Through a taxonomy based on a transfer-approach categorization and a characterization of works based on their data-assumption requirements, the contributions of this article are 1) a comprehensive and systematic revision of knowledge transfer methods for the cross-domain RL setting, 2) a categorization and characterization of such methods to provide an analysis based on relevant features such as their transfer approach and data requirements, and 3) a discussion on the main challenges regarding cross-domain knowledge transfer, as well as on ideas of future directions worth exploring to address these problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Tripathi, Asim Waqas, Matthew B. Schabath, Yasin Yilmaz, Ghulam Rasool</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing accurate machine learning models for oncology requires large-scale, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundation models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical diagnostic and pathology imaging data, medical notes, reports, records, and molecular data. It employs data preprocessing techniques and foundation models to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of these embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyu Wu, Masaaki Nagata, Zhongtao Miao, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka</p>
<p>Abstract: The problem of hallucination and omission, a long-standing problem in machine translation (MT), is more pronounced when a large language model (LLM) is used in MT because an LLM itself is susceptible to these phenomena. In this work, we mitigate the problem in an LLM-based MT model by guiding it to better word alignment. We first study the correlation between word alignment and the phenomena of hallucination and omission in MT. Then we propose to utilize word alignment as preference to optimize the LLM-based MT model. The preference data are constructed by selecting chosen and rejected translations from multiple MT tools. Subsequently, direct preference optimization is used to optimize the LLM-based model towards the preference signal. Given the absence of evaluators specifically designed for hallucination and omission in MT, we further propose selecting hard instances and utilizing GPT-4 to directly evaluate the performance of the models in mitigating these issues. We verify the rationality of these designed evaluation methods by experiments, followed by extensive results demonstrating the effectiveness of word alignment-based preference optimization to mitigate hallucination and omission. On the other hand, although it shows promise in mitigating hallucination and omission, the overall performance of MT in different language directions remains mixed, with slight increases in BLEU and decreases in COMET.</p>

<p>Abstract: Addressing the issue of submerged underwater trash is crucial for safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and preserving marine life. While identifying debris present on the surface of water bodies is straightforward, assessing the underwater submerged waste is a challenge due to the image distortions caused by factors such as light refraction, absorption, suspended particles, color shifts, and occlusion. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art architectures and on the existing datasets to establish a baseline for submerged waste and trash detection. The primary goal remains to establish the benchmark of the object localization techniques to be leveraged by advanced underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles. The ultimate objective is to explore the underwater environment, to identify, and remove underwater debris. The absence of benchmarks (dataset or algorithm) in many researches emphasizes the need for a more robust algorithmic solution. Through this research, we aim to give performance comparative analysis of various underwater trash detection algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Amir Fallah, Mehdi Monemi, Mehdi Rasti, Matti Latva-Aho</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D spot beamfocusing (SBF), in contrast to conventional angular-domain beamforming, concentrates radiating power within very small volume in both radial and angular domains in the near-field zone. Recently the implementation of channel-state-information (CSI)-independent machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been developed for effective SBF using extremely-largescale-programable-metasurface (ELPMs). These methods involve dividing the ELPMs into subarrays and independently training them with Deep Reinforcement Learning to jointly focus the beam at the Desired Focal Point (DFP). This paper explores near-field SBF using ELPMs, addressing challenges associated with lengthy training times resulting from independent training of subarrays. To achieve a faster CSIindependent solution, inspired by the correlation between the beamfocusing matrices of the subarrays, we leverage transfer learning techniques. First, we introduce a novel similarity criterion based on the Phase Distribution Image of subarray apertures. Then we devise a subarray policy propagation scheme that transfers the knowledge from trained to untrained subarrays. We further enhance learning by introducing Quasi-Liquid-Layers as a revised version of the adaptive policy reuse technique. We show through simulations that the proposed scheme improves the training speed about 5 times. Furthermore, for dynamic DFP management, we devised a DFP policy blending process, which augments the convergence rate up to 8-fold.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthesizing images across a wide range of scenarios with customizable prompts, indicating their effective capacity to capture universal features. Motivated by this, our study delves into the utilization of the implicit knowledge embedded within diffusion models to address challenges in cross-domain semantic segmentation. This paper investigates the approach that leverages the sampling and fusion techniques to harness the features of diffusion models efficiently. We propose DIffusion Feature Fusion (DIFF) as a backbone use for extracting and integrating effective semantic representations through the diffusion process. By leveraging the strength of text-to-image generation capability, we introduce a new training framework designed to implicitly learn posterior knowledge from it. Through rigorous evaluation in the contexts of domain generalization semantic segmentation, we establish that our methodology surpasses preceding approaches in mitigating discrepancies across distinct domains and attains the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sha Luo, Sang Jung Kim, Zening Duan, Kaiping Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of computer vision (CV) technologies, the automatic detection and interpretation of gender and emotion in images is a critical area of study. This paper investigates social biases in CV models, emphasizing the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. These metrics often fall short in capturing the complexities of gender and emotion, which are fluid and culturally nuanced constructs. Our study proposes a sociotechnical framework for evaluating CV models, incorporating both technical performance measures and considerations of social fairness. Using a dataset of 5,570 images related to vaccination and climate change, we empirically compared the performance of various CV models, including traditional models like DeepFace and FER, and generative models like GPT-4 Vision. Our analysis involved manually validating the gender and emotional expressions in a subset of images to serve as benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while GPT-4 Vision outperforms other models in technical accuracy for gender classification, it exhibits discriminatory biases, particularly in response to transgender and non-binary personas. Furthermore, the model's emotion detection skew heavily towards positive emotions, with a notable bias towards associating female images with happiness, especially when prompted by male personas. These findings underscore the necessity of developing more comprehensive evaluation criteria that address both validity and discriminatory biases in CV models. Our proposed framework provides guidelines for researchers to critically assess CV tools, ensuring their application in communication research is both ethical and effective. The significant contribution of this study lies in its emphasis on a sociotechnical approach, advocating for CV technologies that support social good and mitigate biases rather than perpetuate them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gengyuan Zhang, Mang Ling Ada Fok, Jialu Ma, Yan Xia, Daniel Cremers, Philip Torr, Volker Tresp, Jindong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Localizing events in videos based on semantic queries is a pivotal task in video understanding, with the growing significance of user-oriented applications like video search. Yet, current research predominantly relies on natural language queries (NLQs), overlooking the potential of using multimodal queries (MQs) that integrate images to more flexibly represent semantic queries -- especially when it is difficult to express non-verbal or unfamiliar concepts in words. To bridge this gap, we introduce ICQ, a new benchmark designed for localizing events in videos with MQs, alongside an evaluation dataset ICQ-Highlight. To accommodate and evaluate existing video localization models for this new task, we propose 3 Multimodal Query Adaptation methods and a novel Surrogate Fine-tuning on pseudo-MQs strategy. ICQ systematically benchmarks 12 state-of-the-art backbone models, spanning from specialized video localization models to Video LLMs, across diverse application domains. Our experiments highlight the high potential of MQs in real-world applications. We believe this benchmark is a first step toward advancing MQs in video event localization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pavel Rumiantsev, Mark Coates</p>
<p>Abstract: In terms of accuracy, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the best architectural choice for the node classification task. Their drawback in real-world deployment is the latency that emerges from the neighbourhood processing operation. One solution to the latency issue is to perform knowledge distillation from a trained GNN to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), where the MLP processes only the features of the node being classified (and possibly some pre-computed structural information). However, the performance of such MLPs in both transductive and inductive settings remains inconsistent for existing knowledge distillation techniques. We propose to address the performance concerns by using a specially-designed student model instead of an MLP. Our model, named Routing-by-Memory (RbM), is a form of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), with a design that enforces expert specialization. By encouraging each expert to specialize on a certain region on the hidden representation space, we demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to derive considerably more consistent performance across multiple datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josh Gardner, Juan C. Perdomo, Ludwig Schmidt</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data -- structured, heterogeneous, spreadsheet-style data with rows and columns -- is widely used in practice across many domains. However, while recent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific datasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer vision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the tabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TabuLa-8B, a language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods for tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset, which comprises over 2.1B rows from over 4M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama 3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and binned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular prediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find that TabuLa-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15 percentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible with existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost, TabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the target datasets, TabuLa-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN models that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16x more data. We release our model, code, and data along with the publication of this paper.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Amir Latifi, Hassan Ghassemian, Maryam Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hubert Plisiecki, Pawe{\l} Lenartowicz, Maria Flakus, Artur Pokropek</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the presence of political bias in emotion inference models used for sentiment analysis (SA) in social science research. Machine learning models often reflect biases in their training data, impacting the validity of their outcomes. While previous research has highlighted gender and race biases, our study focuses on political bias - an underexplored yet pervasive issue that can skew the interpretation of text data across a wide array of studies. We conducted a bias audit on a Polish sentiment analysis model developed in our lab. By analyzing valence predictions for names and sentences involving Polish politicians, we uncovered systematic differences influenced by political affiliations. Our findings indicate that annotations by human raters propagate political biases into the model's predictions. To mitigate this, we pruned the training dataset of texts mentioning these politicians and observed a reduction in bias, though not its complete elimination. Given the significant implications of political bias in SA, our study emphasizes caution in employing these models for social science research. We recommend a critical examination of SA results and propose using lexicon-based systems as a more ideologically neutral alternative. This paper underscores the necessity for ongoing scrutiny and methodological adjustments to ensure the reliability and impartiality of the use of machine learning in academic and applied contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhi Wang, Yixuan Li, Yanhong Zeng, Youqing Fang, Yuwei Guo, Wenran Liu, Jing Tan, Kai Chen, Tianfan Xue, Bo Dai, Dahua Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Human image animation involves generating videos from a character photo, allowing user control and unlocking the potential for video and movie production. While recent approaches yield impressive results using high-quality training data, the inaccessibility of these datasets hampers fair and transparent benchmarking. Moreover, these approaches prioritize 2D human motion and overlook the significance of camera motions in videos, leading to limited control and unstable video generation. To demystify the training data, we present HumanVid, the first large-scale high-quality dataset tailored for human image animation, which combines crafted real-world and synthetic data. For the real-world data, we compile a vast collection of real-world videos from the internet. We developed and applied careful filtering rules to ensure video quality, resulting in a curated collection of 20K high-resolution (1080P) human-centric videos. Human and camera motion annotation is accomplished using a 2D pose estimator and a SLAM-based method. To expand our synthetic dataset, we collected 10K 3D avatar assets and leveraged existing assets of body shapes, skin textures and clothings. Notably, we introduce a rule-based camera trajectory generation method, enabling the synthetic pipeline to incorporate diverse and precise camera motion annotation, which can rarely be found in real-world data. To verify the effectiveness of HumanVid, we establish a baseline model named CamAnimate, short for Camera-controllable Human Animation, that considers both human and camera motions as conditions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that such simple baseline training on our HumanVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling both human pose and camera motions, setting a new benchmark.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Chen, Yikai Wang, Yihao Luo, Zhengyi Wang, Zilong Chen, Jun Zhu, Chi Zhang, Guosheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Meshes are the de facto 3D representation in the industry but are labor-intensive to produce. Recently, a line of research has focused on autoregressively generating meshes. This approach processes meshes into a sequence composed of vertices and then generates them vertex by vertex, similar to how a language model generates text. These methods have achieved some success but still struggle to generate complex meshes. One primary reason for this limitation is their inefficient tokenization methods. To address this issue, we introduce MeshAnything V2, an advanced mesh generation model designed to create Artist-Created Meshes that align precisely with specified shapes. A key innovation behind MeshAnything V2 is our novel Adjacent Mesh Tokenization (AMT) method. Unlike traditional approaches that represent each face using three vertices, AMT optimizes this by employing a single vertex wherever feasible, effectively reducing the token sequence length by about half on average. This not only streamlines the tokenization process but also results in more compact and well-structured sequences, enhancing the efficiency of mesh generation. With these improvements, MeshAnything V2 effectively doubles the face limit compared to previous models, delivering superior performance without increasing computational costs. We will make our code and models publicly available. Project Page: https://buaacyw.github.io/meshanything-v2/</p>

<p>Abstract: The Rectified Power Unit (RePU) activation functions, unlike the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), have the advantage of being a differentiable function when constructing neural networks. However, it can be experimentally observed when deep layers are stacked, neural networks constructed with RePU encounter critical issues.

From the perspective of effective theory, we aim to identify the causes of this phenomenon and propose a new activation function that retains the advantages of RePU while overcoming its drawbacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengze Hong, Wailing Ng, Zichang Guo, Chen Jason Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), a neural network-based Siamese architecture, is gaining momentum in information retrieval and natural language processing. In order to train SEM in a supervised fashion for Web search, the search engine query log is typically utilized to automatically formulate pairwise judgments as training data. Despite the growing application of semantic embeddings in the search engine industry, little work has been done on formulating effective pairwise judgments for training SEM. In this paper, we make the first in-depth investigation of a wide range of strategies for generating pairwise judgments for SEM. An interesting (perhaps surprising) discovery reveals that the conventional pairwise judgment formulation strategy wildly used in the field of pairwise Learning-to-Rank (LTR) is not necessarily effective for training SEM. Through a large-scale empirical study based on query logs and click-through activities from a major commercial search engine, we demonstrate the effective strategies for SEM and highlight the advantages of a hybrid heuristic (i.e., Clicked > Non-Clicked) in comparison to the atomic heuristics (e.g., Clicked > Skipped) in LTR. We conclude with best practices for training SEM and offer promising insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengchao Huang, Bin Xia, Zicheng Lin, Zhun Mou, Wenming Yang, Jiaya Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake technologies has sparked widespread public concern, particularly as face forgery poses a serious threat to public information security. However, the unknown and diverse forgery techniques, varied facial features and complex environmental factors pose significant challenges for face forgery analysis. Existing datasets lack descriptive annotations of these aspects, making it difficult for models to distinguish between real and forged faces using only visual information amid various confounding factors. In addition, existing methods fail to yield user-friendly and explainable results, hindering the understanding of the model's decision-making process. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Open-World Face Forgery Analysis VQA (OW-FFA-VQA) task and its corresponding benchmark. To tackle this task, we first establish a dataset featuring a diverse collection of real and forged face images with essential descriptions and reliable forgery reasoning. Based on this dataset, we introduce FFAA: Face Forgery Analysis Assistant, consisting of a fine-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and Multi-answer Intelligent Decision System (MIDS). By integrating hypothetical prompts with MIDS, the impact of fuzzy classification boundaries is effectively mitigated, enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only provides user-friendly and explainable results but also significantly boosts accuracy and robustness compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Wang, Yuan Zuo, Fengzhi Li, Junjie Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06091">Scalable Multitask Learning Using Gradient-based Estimation of Task Affinity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyue Li, Aneesh Sharma, Hongyang R. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multitask learning is a widely used paradigm for training models on diverse tasks, with applications ranging from graph neural networks to language model fine-tuning. Since tasks may interfere with each other, a key notion for modeling their relationships is task affinity. This includes pairwise task affinity, computed among pairs of tasks, and higher-order affinity, computed among subsets of tasks. Naively computing either of them requires repeatedly training on data from various task combinations, which is computationally intensive. We present a new algorithm Grad-TAG that can estimate task affinities without this repeated training.
  The key idea of Grad-TAG is to train a "base" model for all tasks and then use a linearization technique to estimate the loss of the model for a specific task combination. The linearization works by computing a gradient-based approximation of the loss, using low-dimensional projections of gradients as features in a logistic regression to predict labels for the task combination. We show that the linearized model can provably approximate the loss when the gradient-based approximation is accurate, and also empirically verify that on several large models. Then, given the estimated task affinity, we design a semi-definite program for clustering similar tasks by maximizing the average density of clusters.
  We evaluate Grad-TAG's performance across seven datasets, including multi-label classification on graphs, and instruction fine-tuning of language models. Our task affinity estimates are within 2.7% distance to the true affinities while needing only 3% of FLOPs in full training. On our largest graph with 21M edges and 500 labeling tasks, our algorithm delivers estimates within 5% distance to the true affinities, using only 112 GPU hours. Our results show that Grad-TAG achieves excellent performance and runtime tradeoffs compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Denis Tarasov, Anja Surina, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning regularization techniques, such as dropout, layer normalization, or weight decay, are widely adopted in the construction of modern artificial neural networks, often resulting in more robust training processes and improved generalization capabilities. However, in the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the application of these techniques has been limited, usually applied to value function estimators (Hiraoka et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022), and may result in detrimental effects. This issue is even more pronounced in offline RL settings, which bear greater similarity to supervised learning but have received less attention. Recent work in continuous offline RL (Park et al., 2024) has demonstrated that while we can build sufficiently powerful critic networks, the generalization of actor networks remains a bottleneck. In this study, we empirically show that applying standard regularization techniques to actor networks in offline RL actor-critic algorithms yields improvements of 6% on average across two algorithms and three different continuous D4RL domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in leveraging diverse knowledge sources. This study investigates how nine widely used LLMs allocate knowledge between local context and global parameters when answering open-ended questions in knowledge-consistent scenarios. We introduce a novel dataset, WikiAtomic, and systematically vary context sizes to analyze how LLMs prioritize and utilize the provided information and their parametric knowledge in knowledge-consistent scenarios. Additionally, we also study their tendency to hallucinate under varying context sizes. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across models, including a consistent reliance on both contextual (around 70%) and parametric (around 30%) knowledge, and a decrease in hallucinations with increasing context. These insights highlight the importance of more effective context organization and developing models that use input more deterministically for robust performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unified language generation tasks and revolutionized human-machine interaction. However, in the realm of image generation, a unified model capable of handling various tasks within a single framework remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce OmniGen, a new diffusion model for unified image generation. OmniGen is characterized by the following features: 1) Unification: OmniGen not only demonstrates text-to-image generation capabilities but also inherently supports various downstream tasks, such as image editing, subject-driven generation, and visual-conditional generation. 2) Simplicity: The architecture of OmniGen is highly simplified, eliminating the need for additional plugins. Moreover, compared to existing diffusion models, it is more user-friendly and can complete complex tasks end-to-end through instructions without the need for extra intermediate steps, greatly simplifying the image generation workflow. 3) Knowledge Transfer: Benefit from learning in a unified format, OmniGen effectively transfers knowledge across different tasks, manages unseen tasks and domains, and exhibits novel capabilities. We also explore the model's reasoning capabilities and potential applications of the chain-of-thought mechanism. This work represents the first attempt at a general-purpose image generation model, and we will release our resources at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen to foster future advancements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional federated learning (FL) frameworks rely heavily on terrestrial networks, where coverage limitations and increasing bandwidth congestion significantly hinder model convergence. Fortunately, the advancement of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks offers promising new communication avenues to augment traditional terrestrial FL. Despite this potential, the limited satellite-ground communication bandwidth and the heterogeneous operating environments of ground devices-including variations in data, bandwidth, and computing power-pose substantial challenges for effective and robust satellite-assisted FL. To address these challenges, we propose SatFed, a resource-efficient satellite-assisted heterogeneous FL framework. SatFed implements freshness-based model prioritization queues to optimize the use of highly constrained satellite-ground bandwidth, ensuring the transmission of the most critical models. Additionally, a multigraph is constructed to capture real-time heterogeneous relationships between devices, including data distribution, terrestrial bandwidth, and computing capability. This multigraph enables SatFed to aggregate satellite-transmitted models into peer guidance, enhancing local training in heterogeneous environments. Extensive experiments with real-world LEO satellite networks demonstrate that SatFed achieves superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Senkang Hu, Hangcheng Cao, Yiqin Deng, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojian Yuan, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengfei Hu, Yuhang Qian, Tianyue Zheng, Ang Li, Zhe Chen, Yue Gao, Xiuzhen Cheng, Jun Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the wide adoption of multimodal sensors (e.g., camera, lidar, radar) by autonomous vehicles (AVs), deep analytics to fuse their outputs for a robust perception become imperative. However, existing fusion methods often make two assumptions rarely holding in practice: i) similar data distributions for all inputs and ii) constant availability for all sensors. Because, for example, lidars have various resolutions and failures of radars may occur, such variability often results in significant performance degradation in fusion. To this end, we present tREADi, an adaptive inference system that accommodates the variability of multimodal sensory data and thus enables robust and efficient perception. t-READi identifies variation-sensitive yet structure-specific model parameters; it then adapts only these parameters while keeping the rest intact. t-READi also leverages a cross-modality contrastive learning method to compensate for the loss from missing modalities. Both functions are implemented to maintain compatibility with existing multimodal deep fusion methods. The extensive experiments evidently demonstrate that compared with the status quo approaches, t-READi not only improves the average inference accuracy by more than 6% but also reduces the inference latency by almost 15x with the cost of only 5% extra memory overhead in the worst case under realistic data and modal variations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Differentiable Weightless Neural Network (DWN), a model based on interconnected lookup tables. Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Wang, Dong Gong, Sen Wang, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) has shown remarkable generalization ability in image classification. However, CLIP sometimes encounters performance drops on downstream datasets during zero-shot inference. Test-time adaptation methods attempt to mitigate this by adjusting normalization layers or tuning context prompts with large batch sizes and extensive augmentations; yet, these methods are computationally intensive. This raises an important question: Is there a training-free approach that can efficiently address CLIP's performance drop in such cases? To explore this, we benchmark token condensation techniques, originally designed to enhance the efficiency of vision transformers, on CLIP zero-shot inference tasks. We observe that although token condensation may compromise in-domain accuracy, it surprisingly enhances CLIP's performance on certain cross-dataset benchmarks. This motivates two key inquiries: (1) Can token condensation serve as a "free-lunch" solution for CLIP zero-shot inference? (2) What criteria should guide condensation -- how can essential tokens be identified and redundant ones eliminated? To address these questions, we propose Token Condensation as Adaptation (TCA), a training-free adaptation method for CLIP by pruning class-irrelevant visual tokens while merging class-ambiguous tokens. As the first approach for CLIP's token efficiency, TCA demonstrates superior performance across cross-dataset tasks, achieving up to a 21.4\% improvement over the strongest baseline while reducing GFLOPs by 12.2\% to 48.9\%, with minimized hyperparameter dependency.</p>

<p>Abstract: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding the semantic relationships between queries and documents, even with lengthy and complex long-tail queries. These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we re-formulate the model compression problem into the customized compensation problem: Given a compressed model, we aim to introduce residual low-rank paths to compensate for compression errors under customized requirements from users (e.g., tasks, compression ratios), resulting in greater flexibility in adjusting overall capacity without being constrained by specific compression formats. However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs in various capacity and efficiency requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Marmoset, a highly vocalized primate, has become a popular animal model for studying social-communicative behavior and its underlying mechanism comparing with human infant linguistic developments. In the study of vocal communication, it is vital to know the caller identities, call contents, and vocal exchanges. Previous work of a CNN has achieved a joint model for call segmentation, classification, and caller identification for marmoset vocalizations. However, the CNN has limitations in modeling long-range acoustic patterns; the Transformer architecture that has been shown to outperform CNNs, utilizes the self-attention mechanism that efficiently segregates information parallelly over long distances and captures the global structure of marmoset vocalization. We propose using the Transformer to jointly segment and classify the marmoset calls and identify the callers for each vocalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiong Wang, Yangze Li, Chaoyou Fu, Yunhang Shen, Lei Xie, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Long Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapidly developing large language models (LLMs) have brought tremendous intelligent applications. Especially, the GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve user-agent speech-to-speech conversations. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling both the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken response. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of dialogue ability between users and agents. In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great potential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by limited data and training resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sviatoslav Chalnev, Matthew Siu, Arthur Conmy</p>
<p>Abstract: To control the behavior of language models, steering methods attempt to ensure that outputs of the model satisfy specific pre-defined properties. Adding steering vectors to the model is a promising method of model control that is easier than finetuning, and may be more robust than prompting. However, it can be difficult to anticipate the effects of steering vectors produced by methods such as CAA [Panickssery et al., 2024] or the direct use of SAE latents [Templeton et al., 2024]. In our work, we address this issue by using SAEs to measure the effects of steering vectors, giving us a method that can be used to understand the causal effect of any steering vector intervention. We use this method for measuring causal effects to develop an improved steering method, SAE-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS), which finds steering vectors to target specific SAE features while minimizing unintended side effects. We show that overall, SAE-TS balances steering effects with coherence better than CAA and SAE feature steering, when evaluated on a range of tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcus Williams, Micah Carroll, Adhyyan Narang, Constantin Weisser, Brendan Murphy, Anca Dragan</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziheng Jia, Zicheng Zhang, Jiaying Qian, Haoning Wu, Wei Sun, Chunyi Li, Xiaohong Liu, Weisi Lin, Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent and proliferation of large multi-modal models (LMMs) have introduced new paradigms to computer vision, transforming various tasks into a unified visual question answering framework. Video Quality Assessment (VQA), a classic field in low-level visual perception, focused initially on quantitative video quality scoring. However, driven by advances in LMMs, it is now progressing toward more holistic visual quality understanding tasks. Recent studies in the image domain have demonstrated that Visual Question Answering (VQA) can markedly enhance low-level visual quality evaluation. Nevertheless, related work has not been explored in the video domain, leaving substantial room for improvement. To address this gap, we introduce the VQA2 Instruction Dataset - the first visual question answering instruction dataset that focuses on video quality assessment. This dataset consists of 3 subsets and covers various video types, containing 157,755 instruction question-answer pairs. Then, leveraging this foundation, we present the VQA2 series models. The VQA2 series models interleave visual and motion tokens to enhance the perception of spatial-temporal quality details in videos. We conduct extensive experiments on video quality scoring and understanding tasks, and results demonstrate that the VQA2series models achieve excellent performance in both tasks. Notably, our final model, the VQA2-Assistant, exceeds the renowned GPT-4o in visual quality understanding tasks while maintaining strong competitiveness in quality scoring tasks. Our work provides a foundation and feasible approach for integrating low-level video quality assessment and understanding with LMMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allaa Boutaleb, Jerome Picault, Guillaume Grosjean</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting and tracking emerging trends and weak signals in large, evolving text corpora is vital for applications such as monitoring scientific literature, managing brand reputation, surveilling critical infrastructure and more generally to any kind of text-based event detection. Existing solutions often fail to capture the nuanced context or dynamically track evolving patterns over time. BERTrend, a novel method, addresses these limitations using neural topic modeling in an online setting. It introduces a new metric to quantify topic popularity over time by considering both the number of documents and update frequency. This metric classifies topics as noise, weak, or strong signals, flagging emerging, rapidly growing topics for further investigation. Experimentation on two large real-world datasets demonstrates BERTrend's ability to accurately detect and track meaningful weak signals while filtering out noise, offering a comprehensive solution for monitoring emerging trends in large-scale, evolving text corpora. The method can also be used for retrospective analysis of past events. In addition, the use of Large Language Models together with BERTrend offers efficient means for the interpretability of trends of events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoling Yi, Ryan Antonio, Joren Dumoulin, Jiacong Sun, Josse Van Delm, Guilherme Paim, Marian Verhelst</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) face significant challenges when deployed on resource-constrained extreme edge devices due to their computational and data-intensive nature. While standalone accelerators tailored for specific application scenarios suffer from inflexible control and limited programmability, generic hardware acceleration platforms coupled with RISC-V CPUs can enable high reusability and flexibility, yet typically at the expense of system level efficiency and low utilization. To fill this gap, we propose OpenGeMM, an open-source acceleration platform, jointly demonstrating high efficiency and utilization, as well as ease of configurability and programmability. OpenGeMM encompasses a parameterized Chisel-coded GeMM accelerator, a lightweight RISC-V processor, and a tightly coupled multi-banked scratchpad memory. The GeMM core utilization and system efficiency are boosted through three mechanisms: configuration pre-loading, input pre-fetching with output buffering, and programmable strided memory access. Experimental results show that OpenGeMM can consistently achieve hardware utilization ranging from 81.89% to 99.34% across diverse CNN and Transformer workloads. Compared to the SotA open-source Gemmini accelerator, OpenGeMM demonstrates a 3.58x to 16.40x speedup on normalized throughput across a wide variety ofGeMM workloads, while achieving 4.68 TOPS/W system efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has transformed digital content creation and manipulation. Traditional visual editing tools require significant expertise, limiting accessibility. Recent strides in instruction-based editing have enabled intuitive interaction with visual content, using natural language as a bridge between user intent and complex editing operations. This survey provides an overview of these techniques, focusing on how LLMs and multimodal models empower users to achieve precise visual modifications without deep technical knowledge. By synthesizing over 100 publications, we explore methods from generative adversarial networks to diffusion models, examining multimodal integration for fine-grained content control. We discuss practical applications across domains such as fashion, 3D scene manipulation, and video synthesis, highlighting increased accessibility and alignment with human intuition. Our survey compares existing literature, emphasizing LLM-empowered editing, and identifies key challenges to stimulate further research. We aim to democratize powerful visual editing across various industries, from entertainment to education.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhao Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: The goal of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to detect and track all objects in a scene across frames, while maintaining a unique identity for each object. Most existing methods rely on the spatial-temporal motion features and appearance embedding features of the detected objects in consecutive frames. Effectively and robustly representing the spatial and appearance features of long trajectories has become a critical factor affecting the performance of MOT. We propose a novel approach for appearance and spatial-temporal motion feature representation, improving upon the hierarchical clustering association method MOT FCG. For spatialtemporal motion features, we first propose Diagonal Modulated GIoU, which more accurately represents the relationship between the position and shape of the objects. Second, Mean Constant Velocity Modeling is proposed to reduce the effect of observation noise on target motion state estimation. For appearance features, we utilize a dynamic appearance representation that incorporates confidence information, enabling the trajectory appearance features to be more robust and global. Based on the baseline model MOT FCG, we have realized further improvements in the performance of all. we achieved 63.1 HOTA, 76.9 MOTA and 78.2 IDF1 on the MOT17 test set, and also achieved competitive performance on the MOT20 and DanceTrack sets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for robot task planning, but challenges remain due to VLMs' tendency to generate incorrect action sequences. To address these limitations, we propose VeriGraph, a novel framework that integrates VLMs for robotic planning while verifying action feasibility. VeriGraph employs scene graphs as an intermediate representation, capturing key objects and spatial relationships to improve plan verification and refinement. The system generates a scene graph from input images and uses it to iteratively check and correct action sequences generated by an LLM-based task planner, ensuring constraints are respected and actions are executable. Our approach significantly enhances task completion rates across diverse manipulation scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by 58% for language-based tasks and 30% for image-based tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caspar Oesterheld, Emery Cooper, Miles Kodama, Linh Chi Nguyen, Ethan Perez</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a dataset of natural-language questions in the decision theory of so-called Newcomb-like problems. Newcomb-like problems include, for instance, decision problems in which an agent interacts with a similar other agent, and thus has to reason about the fact that the other agent will likely reason in similar ways. Evaluating LLM reasoning about Newcomb-like problems is important because interactions between foundation-model-based agents will often be Newcomb-like. Some ways of reasoning about Newcomb-like problems may allow for greater cooperation between models.
  Our dataset contains both capabilities questions (i.e., questions with a unique, uncontroversially correct answer) and attitude questions (i.e., questions about which decision theorists would disagree). We use our dataset for an investigation of decision-theoretical capabilities and expressed attitudes and their interplay in existing models (different models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, GDM, Reka, etc.), as well as models under simple prompt-based interventions. We find, among other things, that attitudes vary significantly between existing models; that high capabilities are associated with attitudes more favorable toward so-called evidential decision theory; and that attitudes are consistent across different types of questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Xu, Yiguan Lin, Yinghao Li, Yang Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate exceptional performance in simple code generation tasks but still face challenges in tackling complex problems. These challenges may stem from insufficient reasoning and problem decomposition capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a reasoning-augmented data generation process, SRA-MCTS, which guides the model to autonomously generate high-quality intermediate reasoning paths. This creates a positive feedback loop, enabling continuous improvement. Our method operates entirely through the model itself without requiring additional supervision. By synthesizing natural language reasoning paths and translating them into executable code, the approach ensures analytical accuracy and enhances the success rate in solving complex tasks. Experimental results show that, even without additional supervisory signals, our method achieves performance improvements across different model scales, demonstrating the significant potential of self-improvement in small models. Furthermore, the method remains robust when traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches exhibit performance degradation, with notable improvements observed in diversity metrics such as pass@10. We encourage further exploration of reasoning processes within training data to enhance the ability of language models to address complex problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claudia Biancotti, Carolina Camassa, Andrea Coletta, Oliver Giudice, Aldo Glielmo</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have renewed concerns about AI alignment - the consistency between human and AI goals and values. As various jurisdictions enact legislation on AI safety, the concept of alignment must be defined and measured across different domains. This paper proposes an experimental framework to assess whether LLMs adhere to ethical and legal standards in the relatively unexplored context of finance. We prompt nine LLMs to impersonate the CEO of a financial institution and test their willingness to misuse customer assets to repay outstanding corporate debt. Beginning with a baseline configuration, we adjust preferences, incentives and constraints, analyzing the impact of each adjustment with logistic regression. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the baseline propensity for unethical behavior of LLMs. Factors such as risk aversion, profit expectations, and regulatory environment consistently influence misalignment in ways predicted by economic theory, although the magnitude of these effects varies across LLMs. This paper highlights both the benefits and limitations of simulation-based, ex post safety testing. While it can inform financial authorities and institutions aiming to ensure LLM safety, there is a clear trade-off between generality and cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erica Coppolillo, Federico Cinus, Marco Minici, Francesco Bonchi, Giuseppe Manco</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant persuasion capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks remains underexplored. This study investigates the potential social impact of LLMs in these environments, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges. In particular, we address the following research question: can LLMs learn to generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?
  To answer this question, we define a pipeline to guide the LLM-based content generation which employs reinforcement learning with simulated feedback. In our framework, the reward is based on an engagement model borrowed from the literature on opinion dynamics and information propagation. Moreover, we force the text generated by the LLM to be aligned with a given topic and to satisfy a minimum fluency requirement.
  Using our framework, we analyze the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in tackling the given task, specifically considering the relative positions of the LLM as an agent within the social network and the distribution of opinions in the network on the given topic. Our findings show the full potential of LLMs in creating social engagement. Notable properties of our approach are that the learning procedure is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. In this regard, our approach can be easily refined for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.

<p>Abstract: Structure-based molecule optimization (SBMO) aims to optimize molecules with both continuous coordinates and discrete types against protein targets. A promising direction is to exert gradient guidance on generative models given its remarkable success in images, but it is challenging to guide discrete data and risks inconsistencies between modalities. To this end, we leverage a continuous and differentiable space derived through Bayesian inference, presenting Molecule Joint Optimization (MolJO), the first gradient-based SBMO framework that facilitates joint guidance signals across different modalities while preserving SE(3)-equivariance. We introduce a novel backward correction strategy that optimizes within a sliding window of the past histories, allowing for a seamless trade-off between explore-and-exploit during optimization. Our proposed MolJO achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 benchmark (Success Rate 51.3% , Vina Dock -9.05 and SA 0.78), more than 4x improvement in Success Rate compared to the gradient-based counterpart, and 2x "Me-Better" Ratio as much as 3D baselines. Furthermore, we extend MolJO to a wide range of optimization settings, including multi-objective optimization and challenging tasks in drug design such as R-group optimization and scaffold hopping, further underscoring its versatility and potential.</p>
