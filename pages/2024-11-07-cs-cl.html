<p><b>Authors:</b> Fali Wang, Zhiwei Zhang, Xianren Zhang, Zongyu Wu, Tzuhao Mo, Qiuhao Lu, Wanjing Wang, Rui Li, Junjie Xu, Xianfeng Tang, Qi He, Yao Ma, Ming Huang, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have demonstrated emergent abilities in text generation, question answering, and reasoning, facilitating various tasks and domains. Despite their proficiency in various tasks, LLMs like LaPM 540B and Llama-3.1 405B face limitations due to large parameter sizes and computational demands, often requiring cloud API use which raises privacy concerns, limits real-time applications on edge devices, and increases fine-tuning costs. Additionally, LLMs often underperform in specialized domains such as healthcare and law due to insufficient domain-specific knowledge, necessitating specialized models. Therefore, Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly favored for their low inference latency, cost-effectiveness, efficient development, and easy customization and adaptability. These models are particularly well-suited for resource-limited environments and domain knowledge acquisition, addressing LLMs' challenges and proving ideal for applications that require localized data handling for privacy, minimal inference latency for efficiency, and domain knowledge acquisition through lightweight fine-tuning. The rising demand for SLMs has spurred extensive research and development. However, a comprehensive survey investigating issues related to the definition, acquisition, application, enhancement, and reliability of SLM remains lacking, prompting us to conduct a detailed survey on these topics. The definition of SLMs varies widely, thus to standardize, we propose defining SLMs by their capability to perform specialized tasks and suitability for resource-constrained settings, setting boundaries based on the minimal size for emergent abilities and the maximum size sustainable under resource constraints. For other aspects, we provide a taxonomy of relevant models/methods and develop general frameworks for each category to enhance and utilize SLMs effectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shlomo Neuberger, Niv Eckhaus, Uri Berger, Amir Taubenfeld, Gabriel Stanovsky, Ariel Goldstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Many human interactions, such as political debates, are carried out in group settings, where there are arbitrarily many participants, each with different views and agendas. To explore such complex social settings, we present SAUCE: a customizable Python platform, allowing researchers to plug-and-play various LLMs participating in discussions on any topic chosen by the user. Our platform takes care of instantiating the models, scheduling their responses, managing the discussion history, and producing a comprehensive output log, all customizable through configuration files, requiring little to no coding skills. A novel feature of SAUCE is our asynchronous communication feature, where models decide when to speak in addition to what to say, thus modeling an important facet of human communication. We show SAUCE's attractiveness in two initial experiments, and invite the community to use it in simulating various group simulations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03417">Usefulness of LLMs as an Author Checklist Assistant for Scientific Papers: NeurIPS&#x27;24 Experiment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Goldberg, Ihsan Ullah, Thanh Gia Hieu Khuong, Benedictus Kent Rachmat, Zhen Xu, Isabelle Guyon, Nihar B. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a promising, but controversial, tool in aiding scientific peer review. This study evaluates the usefulness of LLMs in a conference setting as a tool for vetting paper submissions against submission standards. We conduct an experiment at the 2024 Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, where 234 papers were voluntarily submitted to an "LLM-based Checklist Assistant." This assistant validates whether papers adhere to the author checklist used by NeurIPS, which includes questions to ensure compliance with research and manuscript preparation standards. Evaluation of the assistant by NeurIPS paper authors suggests that the LLM-based assistant was generally helpful in verifying checklist completion. In post-usage surveys, over 70% of authors found the assistant useful, and 70% indicate that they would revise their papers or checklist responses based on its feedback. While causal attribution to the assistant is not definitive, qualitative evidence suggests that the LLM contributed to improving some submissions. Survey responses and analysis of re-submissions indicate that authors made substantive revisions to their submissions in response to specific feedback from the LLM. The experiment also highlights common issues with LLMs: inaccuracy (20/52) and excessive strictness (14/52) were the most frequent issues flagged by authors. We also conduct experiments to understand potential gaming of the system, which reveal that the assistant could be manipulated to enhance scores through fabricated justifications, highlighting potential vulnerabilities of automated review tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junior Cedric Tonga, Benjamin Clement, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: The automatic generation of hints by Large Language Models (LLMs) within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) has shown potential to enhance student learning. However, generating pedagogically sound hints that address student misconceptions and adhere to specific educational objectives remains challenging. This work explores using LLMs (GPT-4o and Llama-3-8B-instruct) as teachers to generate effective hints for students simulated through LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, or Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.3) tackling math exercises designed for human high-school students, and designed using cognitive science principles. We present here the study of several dimensions: 1) identifying error patterns made by simulated students on secondary-level math exercises; 2) developing various prompts for GPT-4o as a teacher and evaluating their effectiveness in generating hints that enable simulated students to self-correct; and 3) testing the best-performing prompts, based on their ability to produce relevant hints and facilitate error correction, with Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the teacher, allowing for a performance comparison with GPT-4o. The results show that model errors increase with higher temperature settings. Notably, when hints are generated by GPT-4o, the most effective prompts include prompts tailored to specific errors as well as prompts providing general hints based on common mathematical errors. Interestingly, Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a teacher showed better overall performance than GPT-4o. Also the problem-solving and response revision capabilities of the LLMs as students, particularly GPT-3.5-turbo, improved significantly after receiving hints, especially at lower temperature settings. However, models like Mistral-7B-Instruct demonstrated a decline in performance as the temperature increased.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03497">Uncertainty Quantification for Clinical Outcome Predictions with (Large) Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhang Chen, Peizhao Li, Xiaomeng Dong, Pengyu Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: To facilitate healthcare delivery, language models (LMs) have significant potential for clinical prediction tasks using electronic health records (EHRs). However, in these high-stakes applications, unreliable decisions can result in high costs due to compromised patient safety and ethical concerns, thus increasing the need for good uncertainty modeling of automated clinical predictions. To address this, we consider the uncertainty quantification of LMs for EHR tasks in white- and black-box settings. We first quantify uncertainty in white-box models, where we can access model parameters and output logits. We show that an effective reduction of model uncertainty can be achieved by using the proposed multi-tasking and ensemble methods in EHRs. Continuing with this idea, we extend our approach to black-box settings, including popular proprietary LMs such as GPT-4. We validate our framework using longitudinal clinical data from more than 6,000 patients in ten clinical prediction tasks. Results show that ensembling methods and multi-task prediction prompts reduce uncertainty across different scenarios. These findings increase the transparency of the model in white-box and black-box settings, thus advancing reliable AI healthcare.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03513">Change Is the Only Constant: Dynamic LLM Slicing based on Layer Redundancy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Razvan-Gabriel Dumitru, Paul-Ioan Clotan, Vikas Yadav, Darius Peteleaza, Mihai Surdeanu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model compression approach through dynamic layer-specific pruning in Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing the traditional methodology established by SliceGPT. By transitioning from constant to dynamic slicing, our method leverages the newly proposed Layer Redundancy (LR) score, which assesses how much change each layer changes its input by measuring the cosine similarity of the input to the output of the layer. We use this score to prune parts of individual layers based on redundancy in such a way that the average pruned percentage for all layers is a fixed value. We conducted extensive experiments using models like Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B on multiple datasets, evaluating different slicing bases and percentages to determine optimal configurations that balance efficiency and performance. Our findings show that our dynamic slicing approach not only maintains but, in many cases, enhances model performance compared to the baseline established by constant slicing methods. For instance, in several settings, we see performance improvements of up to 5% over the SliceGPT baseline. Additionally, a perplexity decrease by as much as 7% was observed across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geza Kovacs, Daniel Deutsch, Markus Freitag</p>
<p>Abstract: While Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding using metrics such as COMET or MetricX has outperformed traditional decoding methods such as greedy or beam search, it introduces a challenge we refer to as metric bias. As MBR decoding aims to produce translations that score highly according to a specific utility metric, this very process makes it impossible to use the same metric for both decoding and evaluation, as improvements might simply be due to reward hacking rather than reflecting real quality improvements. In this work we find that compared to human ratings, neural metrics not only overestimate the quality of MBR decoding when the same metric is used as the utility metric, but they also overestimate the quality of MBR/QE decoding with other neural utility metrics as well. We also show that the metric bias issue can be mitigated by using an ensemble of utility metrics during MBR decoding: human evaluations show that MBR decoding using an ensemble of utility metrics outperforms a single utility metric.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03542">Exploring the Benefits of Domain-Pretraining of Generative Large Language Models for Chemistry</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anurag Acharya, Shivam Sharma, Robin Cosbey, Megha Subramanian, Scott Howland, Maria Glenski</p>
<p>Abstract: A proliferation of Large Language Models (the GPT series, BLOOM, LLaMA, and more) are driving forward novel development of multipurpose AI for a variety of tasks, particularly natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models demonstrate strong performance on a range of tasks; however, there has been evidence of brittleness when applied to more niche or narrow domains where hallucinations or fluent but incorrect responses reduce performance. Given the complex nature of scientific domains, it is prudent to investigate the trade-offs of leveraging off-the-shelf versus more targeted foundation models for scientific domains. In this work, we examine the benefits of in-domain pre-training for a given scientific domain, chemistry, and compare these to open-source, off-the-shelf models with zero-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results show that not only do in-domain base models perform reasonably well on in-domain tasks in a zero-shot setting but that further adaptation using instruction fine-tuning yields impressive performance on chemistry-specific tasks such as named entity recognition and molecular formula generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Tang, Janet G. van Hell</p>
<p>Abstract: People tend to distribute information evenly in language production for better and clearer communication. In this study, we compared essays written by second language learners with various native language (L1) backgrounds to investigate how they distribute information in their non-native language (L2) production. Analyses of surprisal and constancy of entropy rate indicated that writers with higher L2 proficiency can reduce the expected uncertainty of language production while still conveying informative content. However, the uniformity of information distribution showed less variability among different groups of L2 speakers, suggesting that this feature may be universal in L2 essay writing and less affected by L2 writers' variability in L1 background and L2 proficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models for American Sign Language (ASL) could make language technologies substantially more accessible to those who sign. To train models on tasks such as isolated sign recognition (ISR) and ASL-to-English translation, datasets provide annotated video examples of ASL signs. To facilitate the generalizability and explainability of these models, we introduce the American Sign Language Knowledge Graph (ASLKG), compiled from twelve sources of expert linguistic knowledge. We use the ASLKG to train neuro-symbolic models for 3 ASL understanding tasks, achieving accuracies of 91% on ISR, 14% for predicting the semantic features of unseen signs, and 36% for classifying the topic of Youtube-ASL videos.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03590">From Medprompt to o1: Exploration of Run-Time Strategies for Medical Challenge Problems and Beyond</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsha Nori, Naoto Usuyama, Nicholas King, Scott Mayer McKinney, Xavier Fernandes, Sheng Zhang, Eric Horvitz</p>
<p>Abstract: Run-time steering strategies like Medprompt are valuable for guiding large language models (LLMs) to top performance on challenging tasks. Medprompt demonstrates that a general LLM can be focused to deliver state-of-the-art performance on specialized domains like medicine by using a prompt to elicit a run-time strategy involving chain of thought reasoning and ensembling. OpenAI's o1-preview model represents a new paradigm, where a model is designed to do run-time reasoning before generating final responses. We seek to understand the behavior of o1-preview on a diverse set of medical challenge problem benchmarks. Following on the Medprompt study with GPT-4, we systematically evaluate the o1-preview model across various medical benchmarks. Notably, even without prompting techniques, o1-preview largely outperforms the GPT-4 series with Medprompt. We further systematically study the efficacy of classic prompt engineering strategies, as represented by Medprompt, within the new paradigm of reasoning models. We found that few-shot prompting hinders o1's performance, suggesting that in-context learning may no longer be an effective steering approach for reasoning-native models. While ensembling remains viable, it is resource-intensive and requires careful cost-performance optimization. Our cost and accuracy analysis across run-time strategies reveals a Pareto frontier, with GPT-4o representing a more affordable option and o1-preview achieving state-of-the-art performance at higher cost. Although o1-preview offers top performance, GPT-4o with steering strategies like Medprompt retains value in specific contexts. Moreover, we note that the o1-preview model has reached near-saturation on many existing medical benchmarks, underscoring the need for new, challenging benchmarks. We close with reflections on general directions for inference-time computation with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yincen Qu, Chao Ma, Yiting Wu, Xiangying Dai, Hui Zhou, Hengyue Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the industry, numerous tasks are deployed online. Traditional approaches often tackle each task separately by its own network, which leads to excessive costs for developing and scaling models, especially in the context of large language models. Although multi-task methods can save costs through parameter sharing, they often struggle to outperform single-task methods in real-world applications. To tackle these challenges, we present a three-stage multi-task learning framework for large language models. It involves task filtering, followed by fine-tuning on high-resource tasks, and finally fine-tuning on all tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments in single-task and multi-task settings. Our approach, exemplified on different benchmarks, demonstrates that it is able to achieve performance comparable to the single-task method while reducing up to 90.9\% of its overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuelin Liu, Yanfei Zhu, Shucheng Zhu, Pengyuan Liu, Ying Liu, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Proper moral beliefs are fundamental for language models, yet assessing these beliefs poses a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel three-module framework to evaluate the moral beliefs of four prominent large language models. Initially, we constructed a dataset containing 472 moral choice scenarios in Chinese, derived from moral words. The decision-making process of the models in these scenarios reveals their moral principle preferences. By ranking these moral choices, we discern the varying moral beliefs held by different language models. Additionally, through moral debates, we investigate the firmness of these models to their moral choices. Our findings indicate that English language models, namely ChatGPT and Gemini, closely mirror moral decisions of the sample of Chinese university students, demonstrating strong adherence to their choices and a preference for individualistic moral beliefs. In contrast, Chinese models such as Ernie and ChatGLM lean towards collectivist moral beliefs, exhibiting ambiguity in their moral choices and debates. This study also uncovers gender bias embedded within the moral beliefs of all examined language models. Our methodology offers an innovative means to assess moral beliefs in both artificial and human intelligence, facilitating a comparison of moral values across different cultures.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large language models (LLMs) have become excellent writing assistants, they still struggle with quotation generation. This is because they either hallucinate when providing factual quotations or fail to provide quotes that exceed human expectations. To bridge the gap, we systematically study how to evaluate and improve LLMs' performance in quotation generation tasks. We first establish a holistic and automatic evaluation system for quotation generation task, which consists of five criteria each with corresponding automatic metric. To improve the LLMs' quotation generation abilities, we construct a bilingual knowledge base that is broad in scope and rich in dimensions, containing up to 32,022 quotes. Moreover, guided by our critiria, we further design a quotation-specific metric to rerank the retrieved quotations from the knowledge base. Extensive experiments show that our metrics strongly correlate with human preferences. Existing LLMs struggle to generate desired quotes, but our quotation knowledge base and reranking metric help narrow this gap.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anaelia Ovalle, Krunoslav Lehman Pavasovic, Louis Martin, Luke Zettlemoyer, Eric Michael Smith, Adina Williams, Levent Sagun</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural-language assistants are designed to provide users with helpful responses while avoiding harmful outputs, largely achieved through alignment to human preferences. Yet there is limited understanding of whether alignment techniques may inadvertently perpetuate or even amplify harmful biases inherited from their pre-aligned base models. This issue is compounded by the choice of bias evaluation benchmarks in popular preference-finetuned models, which predominantly focus on dominant social categories, such as binary gender, thereby limiting insights into biases affecting underrepresented groups. Towards addressing this gap, we center transgender, nonbinary, and other gender-diverse identities to investigate how alignment procedures interact with pre-existing gender-diverse bias in LLMs. Our key contributions include: 1) a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation modalities across leading preference-finetuned LLMs, highlighting critical gaps in gender-diverse representation, 2) systematic evaluation of gender-diverse biases across 12 models spanning Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) stages, uncovering harms popular bias benchmarks fail to detect, and 3) a flexible framework for measuring harmful biases in implicit reward signals applicable to other social contexts. Our findings reveal that DPO-aligned models are particularly sensitive to supervised finetuning (SFT), and can amplify two forms of real-world gender-diverse harms from their base models: stigmatization and gender non-affirmative language. We conclude with recommendations tailored to DPO and broader alignment practices, advocating for the adoption of community-informed bias evaluation frameworks to more effectively identify and address underrepresented harms in LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03766">Number Cookbook: Number Understanding of Language Models and How to Improve It</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotong Yang, Yi Hu, Shijia Kang, Zhouchen Lin, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can solve an increasing number of complex reasoning tasks while making surprising mistakes in basic numerical understanding and processing (such as 9.11 > 9.9). The latter ability is essential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves as a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little attention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer addition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical understanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a benchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct numerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful combinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary education curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding and processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and clear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many of the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and potential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as special tokenizers, PEs, and number formats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We also finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1) naive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2) surprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for finetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought techniques on NUPA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youssef Mohamed, Runjia Li, Ibrahim Said Ahmad, Kilichbek Haydarov, Philip Torr, Kenneth Ward Church, Mohamed Elhoseiny</p>
<p>Abstract: Research in vision and language has made considerable progress thanks to benchmarks such as COCO. COCO captions focused on unambiguous facts in English; ArtEmis introduced subjective emotions and ArtELingo introduced some multilinguality (Chinese and Arabic). However we believe there should be more multilinguality. Hence, we present ArtELingo-28, a vision-language benchmark that spans $\textbf{28}$ languages and encompasses approximately $\textbf{200,000}$ annotations ($\textbf{140}$ annotations per image). Traditionally, vision research focused on unambiguous class labels, whereas ArtELingo-28 emphasizes diversity of opinions over languages and cultures. The challenge is to build machine learning systems that assign emotional captions to images. Baseline results will be presented for three novel conditions: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot and One-vs-All Zero-Shot. We find that cross-lingual transfer is more successful for culturally-related languages. Data and code are provided at www.artelingo.org.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Li, Fang Li, Kirk Roberts, Licong Cui, Cui Tao, Hua Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating discharge summaries is a crucial yet time-consuming task in clinical practice, essential for conveying pertinent patient information and facilitating continuity of care. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capability in understanding and summarizing complex medical texts. This research aims to explore how LLMs can alleviate the burden of manual summarization, streamline workflow efficiencies, and support informed decision-making in healthcare settings. Clinical notes from a cohort of 1,099 lung cancer patients were utilized, with a subset of 50 patients for testing purposes, and 102 patients used for model fine-tuning. This study evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA 3 8b, in generating discharge summaries. Evaluation metrics included token-level analysis (BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L) and semantic similarity scores between model-generated summaries and physician-written gold standards. LLaMA 3 8b was further tested on clinical notes of varying lengths to examine the stability of its performance. The study found notable variations in summarization capabilities among LLMs. GPT-4o and fine-tuned LLaMA 3 demonstrated superior token-level evaluation metrics, while LLaMA 3 consistently produced concise summaries across different input lengths. Semantic similarity scores indicated GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 as leading models in capturing clinical relevance. This study contributes insights into the efficacy of LLMs for generating discharge summaries, highlighting LLaMA 3's robust performance in maintaining clarity and relevance across varying clinical contexts. These findings underscore the potential of automated summarization tools to enhance documentation precision and efficiency, ultimately improving patient care and operational capability in healthcare settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiu Ting Lau, Arkaitz Zubiaga</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Generation has been rapidly developing with the advent of large language models (LLMs). While their usage has sparked significant attention from the general public, it is important for readers to be aware when a piece of text is LLM-generated. This has brought about the need for building models that enable automated LLM-generated text detection, with the aim of mitigating potential negative outcomes of such content. Existing LLM-generated detectors show competitive performances in telling apart LLM-generated and human-written text, but this performance is likely to deteriorate when paraphrased texts are considered. In this study, we devise a new data collection strategy to collect Human & LLM Paraphrase Collection (HLPC), a first-of-its-kind dataset that incorporates human-written texts and paraphrases, as well as LLM-generated texts and paraphrases. With the aim of understanding the effects of human-written paraphrases on the performance of state-of-the-art LLM-generated text detectors OpenAI RoBERTa and watermark detectors, we perform classification experiments that incorporate human-written paraphrases, watermarked and non-watermarked LLM-generated documents from GPT and OPT, and LLM-generated paraphrases from DIPPER and BART. The results show that the inclusion of human-written paraphrases has a significant impact of LLM-generated detector performance, promoting TPR@1%FPR with a possible trade-off of AUROC and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erich Round, Louise Esher, Sacha Beniamine</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous morphology, such as inflection class systems and paradigmatic distribution patterns, is widespread and diachronically resilient in natural language. Why this should be so has remained unclear given that autonomous morphology imposes learning costs, offers no clear benefit relative to its absence and could easily be removed by the analogical forces which are constantly reshaping it. Here we propose an explanation for the resilience of autonomous morphology, in terms of a diachronic dynamic of attraction and repulsion between morphomic categories, which emerges spontaneously from a simple paradigm cell filling process. Employing computational evolutionary models, our key innovation is to bring to light the role of `dissociative evidence', i.e., evidence for inflectional distinctiveness which a rational reasoner will have access to during analogical inference. Dissociative evidence creates a repulsion dynamic which prevents morphomic classes from collapsing together entirely, i.e., undergoing complete levelling. As we probe alternative models, we reveal the limits of conditional entropy as a measure for predictability in systems that are undergoing change. Finally, we demonstrate that autonomous morphology, far from being `unnatural' (e.g. \citealt{Aronoff1994}), is rather the natural (emergent) consequence of a natural (rational) process of inference applied to inflectional systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masakazu Yoshimura, Teruaki Hayashi, Yota Maeda</p>
<p>Abstract: An ecosystem of Transformer-based models has been established by building large models with extensive data. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a crucial technology for deploying these models to downstream tasks with minimal cost while achieving effective performance. Recently, Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM)-based model, has attracted attention as a potential alternative to Transformers. While many large-scale Mamba-based models have been proposed, efficiently adapting pre-trained Mamba-based models to downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory analysis of PEFT methods for Mamba. We investigate the effectiveness of existing PEFT methods for Transformers when applied to Mamba. We also modify these methods to better align with the Mamba architecture. Additionally, we propose new Mamba-specific PEFT methods that leverage the distinctive structure of Mamba. Our experiments indicate that PEFT performs more effectively for Mamba than Transformers. Lastly, we demonstrate how to effectively combine multiple PEFT methods and provide a framework that outperforms previous works. To ensure reproducibility, we will release the code after publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that training a linear connector between speech foundation encoders and large language models (LLMs) enables this architecture to achieve strong ASR capabilities. Despite the impressive results, it remains unclear whether these simple approaches are robust enough across different scenarios and speech conditions, such as domain shifts and different speech perturbations. In this paper, we address these questions by conducting various ablation experiments using a recent and widely adopted approach called SLAM-ASR. We present novel empirical findings that offer insights on how to effectively utilize the SLAM-ASR architecture across a wide range of settings. Our main findings indicate that the SLAM-ASR exhibits poor performance in cross-domain evaluation settings. Additionally, speech perturbations within in-domain data, such as changes in speed or the presence of additive noise, can significantly impact performance. Our findings offer critical insights for fine-tuning and configuring robust LLM-based ASR models, tailored to different data characteristics and computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Cabello, Carmen Martin-Turrero, Uchenna Akujuobi, Anders S{\o}gaard, Carlos Bobed</p>
<p>Abstract: Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context and unstated, relevant domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), which underpin most contemporary question answering systems, struggle to induce how concepts relate in specialized domains such as medicine. Existing medical LLMs are also costly to train. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to integrate graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs greatly benefit from the factual grounding provided by knowledge graph embeddings. MEG attains an average of +10.2% accuracy over the Mistral-Instruct baseline, and +6.7% over specialized models like BioMistral. We also show results based on Llama-3. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Zhuo, Ya Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaoqing Li, Xun Zhou, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Duc Bui, Katharina von der Wense, Anne Lauscher</p>
<p>Abstract: Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting
  Hate speech moderation on global platforms poses unique challenges due to the multimodal and multilingual nature of content, along with the varying cultural perceptions. How well do current vision-language models (VLMs) navigate these nuances? To investigate this, we create the first multimodal and multilingual parallel hate speech dataset, annotated by a multicultural set of annotators, called Multi3Hate. It contains 300 parallel meme samples across 5 languages: English, German, Spanish, Hindi, and Mandarin. We demonstrate that cultural background significantly affects multimodal hate speech annotation in our dataset. The average pairwise agreement among countries is just 74%, significantly lower than that of randomly selected annotator groups. Our qualitative analysis indicates that the lowest pairwise label agreement-only 67% between the USA and India-can be attributed to cultural factors. We then conduct experiments with 5 large VLMs in a zero-shot setting, finding that these models align more closely with annotations from the US than with those from other cultures, even when the memes and prompts are presented in the dominant language of the other culture. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MinhDucBui/Multi3Hate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Allison Keith, Antonio Rojas Castro, Sebastian Pad\'o</p>
<p>Abstract: In theatre, playwrights use the portrayal of characters to explore culturally based gender norms. In this paper, we develop quantitative methods to study gender depiction in the non-religious works (comedias) of Pedro Calder\'on de la Barca, a prolific Spanish 17th century author. We gather insights from a corpus of more than 100 plays by using a gender classifier and applying model explainability (attribution) methods to determine which text features are most influential in the model's decision to classify speech as 'male' or 'female', indicating the most gendered elements of dialogue in Calder\'on's comedias in a human accessible manner. We find that female and male characters are portrayed differently and can be identified by the gender prediction model at practically useful accuracies (up to f=0.83). Analysis reveals semantic aspects of gender portrayal, and demonstrates that the model is even useful in providing a relatively accurate scene-by-scene prediction of cross-dressing characters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-time detection of out-of-context LLM outputs is crucial for enterprises looking to safely adopt RAG applications. In this work, we train lightweight models to discriminate LLM-generated text that is semantically out-of-context from retrieved text documents. We preprocess a combination of summarisation and semantic textual similarity datasets to construct training data using minimal resources. We find that DeBERTa is not only the best-performing model under this pipeline, but it is also fast and does not require additional text preprocessing or feature engineering. While emerging work demonstrates that generative LLMs can also be fine-tuned and used in complex data pipelines to achieve state-of-the-art performance, we note that speed and resource limits are important considerations for on-premise deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaditya K. Singh, Muhammed Yusuf Kocyigit, Andrew Poulton, David Esiobu, Maria Lomeli, Gergely Szilvasy, Dieuwke Hupkes</p>
<p>Abstract: Hampering the interpretation of benchmark scores, evaluation data contamination has become a growing concern in the evaluation of LLMs, and an active area of research studies its effects. While evaluation data contamination is easily understood intuitively, it is surprisingly difficult to define precisely which samples should be considered contaminated and, consequently, how it impacts benchmark scores. We propose that these questions should be addressed together and that contamination metrics can be assessed based on whether models benefit from the examples they mark contaminated. We propose a novel analysis method called ConTAM, and show with a large scale survey of existing and novel n-gram based contamination metrics across 13 benchmarks and 7 models from 2 different families that ConTAM can be used to better understand evaluation data contamination and its effects. We find that contamination may have a much larger effect than reported in recent LLM releases and benefits models differently at different scales. We also find that considering only the longest contaminated substring provides a better signal than considering a union of all contaminated substrings, and that doing model and benchmark specific threshold analysis greatly increases the specificity of the results. Lastly, we investigate the impact of hyperparameter choices, finding that, among other things, both using larger values of n and disregarding matches that are infrequent in the pre-training data lead to many false negatives. With ConTAM, we provide a method to empirically ground evaluation data contamination metrics in downstream effects. With our exploration, we shed light on how evaluation data contamination can impact LLMs and provide insight into the considerations important when doing contamination analysis. We end our paper by discussing these in more detail and providing concrete suggestions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The generic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation, Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been implemented in many ontology matching (OM) systems. However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on OM tasks at syntactic levels. Our experiments on 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) track repositories with 49 distinct alignments indicate: (1) Tokenisation and Normalisation are currently more effective than Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation; and (2) The selection of Lemmatisation and Stemming is task-specific. We recommend standalone Lemmatisation or Stemming with post-hoc corrections. We find that (3) Porter Stemmer and Snowball Stemmer perform better than Lancaster Stemmer; and that (4) Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging does not help Lemmatisation. To repair less effective Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation used in OM tasks, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that significantly improves matching correctness and overall matching performance. We also discuss the use of text preprocessing pipeline in the new era of large language models (LLMs).</p>

<p>Abstract: Commonsense datasets have been well developed in Natural Language Processing, mainly through crowdsource human annotation. However, there are debates on the genuineness of commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In specific, a significant portion of instances in some commonsense benchmarks do not concern commonsense knowledge. That problem would undermine the measurement of the true commonsense reasoning ability of evaluated models. It is also suggested that the problem originated from a blurry concept of commonsense knowledge, as distinguished from other types of knowledge. To demystify all of the above claims, in this study, we survey existing definitions of commonsense knowledge, ground into the three frameworks for defining concepts, and consolidate them into a multi-framework unified definition of commonsense knowledge (so-called consolidated definition). We then use the consolidated definition for annotations and experiments on the CommonsenseQA and CommonsenseQA 2.0 datasets to examine the above claims. Our study shows that there exists a large portion of non-commonsense-knowledge instances in the two datasets, and a large performance gap on these two subsets where Large Language Models (LLMs) perform worse on commonsense-knowledge instances.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anxiety, the anticipatory unease about a potential negative outcome, is a common and beneficial human emotion. However, there is still much that is not known, such as how anxiety relates to our body and how it manifests in language. This is especially pertinent given the increasing impact of anxiety-related disorders. In this work, we introduce WorryWords, the first large-scale repository of manually derived word--anxiety associations for over 44,450 English words. We show that the anxiety associations are highly reliable. We use WorryWords to study the relationship between anxiety and other emotion constructs, as well as the rate at which children acquire anxiety words with age. Finally, we show that using WorryWords alone, one can accurately track the change of anxiety in streams of text. The lexicon enables a wide variety of anxiety-related research in psychology, NLP, public health, and social sciences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Identification (LI) is crucial for various natural language processing tasks, serving as a foundational step in applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval. In multilingual societies like India, particularly among the youth engaging on social media, text often exhibits code-mixing, blending local languages with English at different linguistic levels. This phenomenon presents formidable challenges for LI systems, especially when languages intermingle within single words. Dravidian languages, prevalent in southern India, possess rich morphological structures yet suffer from under-representation in digital platforms, leading to the adoption of Roman or hybrid scripts for communication. This paper introduces a prompt based method for a shared task aimed at addressing word-level LI challenges in Dravidian languages. In this work, we leveraged GPT-3.5 Turbo to understand whether the large language models is able to correctly classify words into correct categories. Our findings show that the Kannada model consistently outperformed the Tamil model across most metrics, indicating a higher accuracy and reliability in identifying and categorizing Kannada language instances. In contrast, the Tamil model showed moderate performance, particularly needing improvement in precision and recall.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has increased the volume of machine-generated texts (MGTs) and blurred text authorship in various domains. However, most existing MGT benchmarks include single-author texts (human-written and machine-generated). This conventional design fails to capture more practical multi-author scenarios, where the user refines the LLM response for natural flow, coherence, and factual correctness. Our paper introduces the Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs (Beemo), which includes 6.5k texts written by humans, generated by ten instruction-finetuned LLMs, and edited by experts for various use cases, ranging from creative writing to summarization. Beemo additionally comprises 13.1k machine-generated and LLM-edited texts, allowing for diverse MGT detection evaluation across various edit types. We document Beemo's creation protocol and present the results of benchmarking 33 configurations of MGT detectors in different experimental setups. We find that expert-based editing evades MGT detection, while LLM-edited texts are unlikely to be recognized as human-written. Beemo and all materials are publicly available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for evaluating foundation models mainly focus on single-document, text-only tasks. However, they often fail to fully capture the complexity of research workflows, which typically involve interpreting non-textual data and gathering information across multiple documents. To address this gap, we introduce M3SciQA, a multi-modal, multi-document scientific question answering benchmark designed for a more comprehensive evaluation of foundation models. M3SciQA consists of 1,452 expert-annotated questions spanning 70 natural language processing paper clusters, where each cluster represents a primary paper along with all its cited documents, mirroring the workflow of comprehending a single paper by requiring multi-modal and multi-document data. With M3SciQA, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 foundation models. Our results indicate that current foundation models still significantly underperform compared to human experts in multi-modal information retrieval and in reasoning across multiple scientific documents. Additionally, we explore the implications of these findings for the future advancement of applying foundation models in multi-modal scientific literature analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Content moderation typically combines the efforts of human moderators and machine learning models.However, these systems often rely on data where significant disagreement occurs during moderation, reflecting the subjective nature of toxicity perception.Rather than dismissing this disagreement as noise, we interpret it as a valuable signal that highlights the inherent ambiguity of the content,an insight missed when only the majority label is considered.In this work, we introduce a novel content moderation framework that emphasizes the importance of capturing annotation disagreement. Our approach uses multitask learning, where toxicity classification serves as the primary task and annotation disagreement is addressed as an auxiliary task.Additionally, we leverage uncertainty estimation techniques, specifically Conformal Prediction, to account for both the ambiguity in comment annotations and the model's inherent uncertainty in predicting toxicity and disagreement.The framework also allows moderators to adjust thresholds for annotation disagreement, offering flexibility in determining when ambiguity should trigger a review.We demonstrate that our joint approach enhances model performance, calibration, and uncertainty estimation, while offering greater parameter efficiency and improving the review process in comparison to single-task methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Deas, Kathleen McKeown</p>
<p>Abstract: Global partisan hostility and polarization has increased, and this polarization is heightened around presidential elections. Models capable of generating accurate summaries of diverse perspectives can help reduce such polarization by exposing users to alternative perspectives. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset and task for independently summarizing each political perspective in a set of passages from opinionated news articles. For this task, we propose a framework for evaluating different dimensions of perspective summary performance. We benchmark 10 models of varying sizes and architectures through both automatic and human evaluation. While recent models like GPT-4o perform well on this task, we find that all models struggle to generate summaries faithful to the intended perspective. Our analysis of summaries focuses on how extraction behavior depends on the features of the input documents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Archiki Prasad, Weizhe Yuan, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Jing Xu, Maryam Fazel-Zarandi, Mohit Bansal, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Jane Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-alignment, whereby models learn to improve themselves without human annotation, is a rapidly growing research area. However, existing techniques often fail to improve complex reasoning tasks due to the difficulty of assigning correct rewards. An orthogonal approach that is known to improve correctness is self-consistency, a method applied at inference time based on multiple sampling in order to find the most consistent answer. In this work, we extend the self-consistency concept to help train models. We thus introduce self-consistency preference optimization (ScPO), which iteratively trains consistent answers to be preferred over inconsistent ones on unsupervised new problems. We show ScPO leads to large improvements over conventional reward model training on reasoning tasks such as GSM8K and MATH, closing the gap with supervised training with gold answers or preferences, and that combining ScPO with standard supervised learning improves results even further. On ZebraLogic, ScPO finetunes Llama-3 8B to be superior to Llama-3 70B, Gemma-2 27B, and Claude-3 Haiku.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel P. Jeong, Saurabh Garg, Zachary C. Lipton, Michael Oberst</p>
<p>Abstract: Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance, across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 38.2% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxiao Yu, Zhaotian Weng, Zheng Li, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) accurately predict election outcomes? While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains, including healthcare, legal analysis, and creative tasks, their ability to forecast elections remains unknown. Election prediction poses unique challenges, such as limited voter-level data, rapidly changing political landscapes, and the need to model complex human behavior. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-step reasoning framework designed for political analysis. Our approach is validated on real-world data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2016 and 2020, as well as synthetic personas generated by the leading machine learning framework, offering scalable datasets for voter behavior modeling. To capture temporal dynamics, we incorporate candidates' policy positions and biographical details, ensuring that the model adapts to evolving political contexts. Drawing on Chain of Thought prompting, our multi-step reasoning pipeline systematically integrates demographic, ideological, and time-dependent factors, enhancing the model's predictive power. Additionally, we apply our framework to predict the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election in advance, demonstrating the adaptability of LLMs to unseen political data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Humphries, Lianne C. Leddy, Quinn Downton, Meredith Legace, John McConnell, Isabella Murray, Elizabeth Spence</p>
<p>Abstract: This study demonstrates that Large Language Models (LLMs) can transcribe historical handwritten documents with significantly higher accuracy than specialized Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) software, while being faster and more cost-effective. We introduce an open-source software tool called Transcription Pearl that leverages these capabilities to automatically transcribe and correct batches of handwritten documents using commercially available multimodal LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. In tests on a diverse corpus of 18th/19th century English language handwritten documents, LLMs achieved Character Error Rates (CER) of 5.7 to 7% and Word Error Rates (WER) of 8.9 to 15.9%, improvements of 14% and 32% respectively over specialized state-of-the-art HTR software like Transkribus. Most significantly, when LLMs were then used to correct those transcriptions as well as texts generated by conventional HTR software, they achieved near-human levels of accuracy, that is CERs as low as 1.8% and WERs of 3.5%. The LLMs also completed these tasks 50 times faster and at approximately 1/50th the cost of proprietary HTR programs. These results demonstrate that when LLMs are incorporated into software tools like Transcription Pearl, they provide an accessible, fast, and highly accurate method for mass transcription of historical handwritten documents, significantly streamlining the digitization process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathalie Maria Kirch, Severin Field, Stephen Casper</p>
<p>Abstract: While `jailbreaks' have been central to research on the safety and reliability of LLMs (large language models), the underlying mechanisms behind these attacks are not well understood. Some prior works have used linear methods to analyze jailbreak prompts or model refusal. Here, however, we compare linear and nonlinear methods to study the features in prompts that contribute to successful jailbreaks. We do this by probing for jailbreak success based only on the portions of the latent representations corresponding to prompt tokens. First, we introduce a dataset of 10,800 jailbreak attempts from 35 attack methods. We then show that different jailbreaking methods work via different nonlinear features in prompts. Specifically, we find that while probes can distinguish between successful and unsuccessful jailbreaking prompts with a high degree of accuracy, they often transfer poorly to held-out attack methods. We also show that nonlinear probes can be used to mechanistically jailbreak the LLM by guiding the design of adversarial latent perturbations. These mechanistic jailbreaks are able to jailbreak Gemma-7B-IT more reliably than 34 of the 35 techniques that it was trained on. Ultimately, our results suggest that jailbreaks cannot be thoroughly understood in terms of universal or linear prompt features alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have gained attention for their ability to enhance LLMs' reasoning by incorporating external knowledge but suffer from limited contextual window size, leading to insufficient information injection. To this end, we propose a novel framework, RuAG, to automatically distill large volumes of offline data into interpretable first-order logic rules, which are injected into LLMs to boost their reasoning capabilities. Our method begins by formulating the search process relying on LLMs' commonsense, where LLMs automatically define head and body predicates. Then, RuAG applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address the combinational searching space and efficiently discover logic rules from data. The resulting logic rules are translated into natural language, allowing targeted knowledge injection and seamless integration into LLM prompts for LLM's downstream task reasoning. We evaluate our framework on public and private industrial tasks, including natural language processing, time-series, decision-making, and industrial tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM's capability over diverse tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in encoding clinical knowledge and responding to complex medical queries with appropriate clinical reasoning. However, their applicability in subspecialist or complex medical settings remains underexplored. In this work, we probe the performance of AMIE, a research conversational diagnostic AI system, in the subspecialist domain of breast oncology care without specific fine-tuning to this challenging domain. To perform this evaluation, we curated a set of 50 synthetic breast cancer vignettes representing a range of treatment-naive and treatment-refractory cases and mirroring the key information available to a multidisciplinary tumor board for decision-making (openly released with this work). We developed a detailed clinical rubric for evaluating management plans, including axes such as the quality of case summarization, safety of the proposed care plan, and recommendations for chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and hormonal therapy. To improve performance, we enhanced AMIE with the inference-time ability to perform web search retrieval to gather relevant and up-to-date clinical knowledge and refine its responses with a multi-stage self-critique pipeline. We compare response quality of AMIE with internal medicine trainees, oncology fellows, and general oncology attendings under both automated and specialist clinician evaluations. In our evaluations, AMIE outperformed trainees and fellows demonstrating the potential of the system in this challenging and important domain. We further demonstrate through qualitative examples, how systems such as AMIE might facilitate conversational interactions to assist clinicians in their decision making. However, AMIE's performance was overall inferior to attending oncologists suggesting that further research is needed prior to consideration of prospective uses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural networks can conceal malicious Trojan backdoors that allow a trigger to covertly change the model behavior. Detecting signs of these backdoors, particularly without access to any triggered data, is the subject of ongoing research and open challenges. In one common formulation of the problem, we are given a set of clean and poisoned models and need to predict whether a given test model is clean or poisoned. In this paper, we introduce a detector that works remarkably well across many of the existing datasets and domains. It is obtained by training a binary classifier on a large number of models' weights after performing a few different pre-processing steps including feature selection and standardization, reference model weights subtraction, and model alignment prior to detection. We evaluate this algorithm on a diverse set of Trojan detection benchmarks and domains and examine the cases where the approach is most and least effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manar Abdelatty, Jingxiao Ma, Sherief Reda</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to various hardware design tasks, including Verilog code generation, EDA tool scripting, and RTL bug fixing. Despite this extensive exploration, LLMs are yet to be used for the task of post-synthesis metric reasoning and estimation of HDL designs. In this paper, we assess the ability of LLMs to reason about post-synthesis metrics of Verilog designs. We introduce MetRex, a large-scale dataset comprising 25,868 Verilog HDL designs and their corresponding post-synthesis metrics, namely area, delay, and static power. MetRex incorporates a Chain of Thought (CoT) template to enhance LLMs' reasoning about these metrics. Extensive experiments show that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) boosts the LLM's reasoning capabilities on average by 37.0\%, 25.3\%, and 25.7\% on the area, delay, and static power, respectively. While SFT improves performance on our benchmark, it remains far from achieving optimal results, especially on complex problems. Comparing to state-of-the-art regression models, our approach delivers accurate post-synthesis predictions for 17.4\% more designs (within a 5\% error margin), in addition to offering a 1.7x speedup by eliminating the need for pre-processing. This work lays the groundwork for advancing LLM-based Verilog code metric reasoning.</p>

This distribution-based nature offers an alternative perspective for analyzing algorithmic fidelity, complementing the approach used in silicon sampling. We demonstrate the use of distribution-based prediction in the context of recent United States presidential election, showing that this method can be used to determine task specific bias, prompt noise, and algorithmic fidelity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Surya Duvvuri, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have had tremendous impact for several sequence related tasks, largely due to their ability to retrieve from any part of the sequence via softmax based dot-product attention. This mechanism plays a crucial role in Transformer's performance. We analyze the gradients backpropagated through the softmax operation in the attention mechanism and observe that these gradients can often be small. This poor gradient signal backpropagation can lead to inefficient learning of parameters preceeding the attention operations. To this end, we introduce a new attention mechanism called LASER, which we analytically show to admit a larger gradient signal. We show that LASER Attention can be implemented by making small modifications to existing attention implementations. We conduct experiments on autoregressive large language models (LLMs) with upto 2.2 billion parameters where we show upto 3.38% and an average of ~1% improvement over standard attention on downstream evaluations. Using LASER gives the following relative improvements in generalization performance across a variety of tasks (vision, text and speech): 4.67% accuracy in Vision Transformer (ViT) on Imagenet, 2.25% error rate in Conformer on the Librispeech speech-to-text and 0.93% fraction of incorrect predictions in BERT with 2.2 billion parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information. With the advent of LLMs that support increasingly longer context lengths, there is a growing interest in understanding how these models perform in RAG scenarios. Can these new long context models improve RAG performance? This paper presents a comprehensive study of the impact of increased context length on RAG performance across 20 popular open source and commercial LLMs. We ran RAG workflows while varying the total context length from 2,000 to 128,000 tokens (and 2 million tokens when possible) on three domain-specific datasets, and report key insights on the benefits and limitations of long context in RAG applications. Our findings reveal that while retrieving more documents can improve performance, only a handful of the most recent state of the art LLMs can maintain consistent accuracy at long context above 64k tokens. We also identify distinct failure modes in long context scenarios, suggesting areas for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in their reservoir of knowledge and understanding capabilities, but they have also been shown to be prone to illegal or unethical reactions when subjected to jailbreak attacks. To ensure their responsible deployment in critical applications, it is crucial to understand the safety capabilities and vulnerabilities of LLMs. Previous works mainly focus on jailbreak in single-round dialogue, overlooking the potential jailbreak risks in multi-round dialogues, which are a vital way humans interact with and extract information from LLMs. Some studies have increasingly concentrated on the risks associated with jailbreak in multi-round dialogues. These efforts typically involve the use of manually crafted templates or prompt engineering techniques. However, due to the inherent complexity of multi-round dialogues, their jailbreak performance is limited. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-round dialogue jailbreaking agent, emphasizing the importance of stealthiness in identifying and mitigating potential threats to human values posed by LLMs. We propose a risk decomposition strategy that distributes risks across multiple rounds of queries and utilizes psychological strategies to enhance attack strength. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method surpasses other attack methods and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate. We will make the corresponding code and dataset available for future research. The code will be released soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: The outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) render them a crucial component in various autonomous agent systems. While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Maria Schmidt, Mohammad Fazleh Elahi, Philipp Cimiano</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we examine the impact of lexicalization on Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD). It is well known that one of the key challenges in interpreting natural language questions with respect to SPARQL lies in bridging the lexical gap, that is mapping the words in the query to the correct vocabulary elements. We argue in this paper that lexicalization, that is explicit knowledge about the potential interpretations of a word with respect to the given vocabulary, significantly eases the task and increases the performance of QA systems. Towards this goal, we present a compositional QA system that can leverage explicit lexical knowledge in a compositional manner to infer the meaning of a question in terms of a SPARQL query. We show that such a system, given lexical knowledge, has a performance well beyond current QA systems, achieving up to a $35.8\%$ increase in the micro $F_1$ score compared to the best QA system on QALD-9. This shows the importance and potential of including explicit lexical knowledge. In contrast, we show that LLMs have limited abilities to exploit lexical knowledge, with only marginal improvements compared to a version without lexical knowledge. This shows that LLMs have no ability to compositionally interpret a question on the basis of the meaning of its parts, a key feature of compositional approaches. Taken together, our work shows new avenues for QALD research, emphasizing the importance of lexicalization and compositionality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khasmamad Shabanovi, Lukas Wiest, Vladimir Golkov, Daniel Cremers, Thomas Pfeil</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training quantization is widely employed to reduce the computational demands of neural networks. Typically, individual substructures, such as layers or blocks of layers, are quantized with the objective of minimizing quantization errors in their pre-activations by fine-tuning the corresponding weights. Deriving this local objective from the global objective of minimizing task loss involves two key simplifications: assuming substructures are mutually independent and ignoring the knowledge of subsequent substructures as well as the task loss. In this work, we assess the effects of these simplifications on weight-only quantization of large language models. We introduce two multi-block fine-tuning strategies and compare them against the baseline of fine-tuning single transformer blocks. The first captures correlations of weights across blocks by jointly optimizing multiple quantized blocks. The second incorporates knowledge of subsequent blocks by minimizing the error in downstream pre-activations rather than focusing solely on the quantized block. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific network model, with no impact on some models but demonstrating significant benefits for others.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown amazing performance on tasks that require planning and reasoning. Motivated by this, we investigate the internal mechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logical reasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem that serves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially, this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve, but we can train a small transformer to achieve perfect accuracy. Building on our set-up, we then pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layer transformer, trained from scratch, solves this problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning" circuits in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attention blocks to implement the desired logic. To expand our findings, we then study a larger model, Mistral 7B. Using activation patching, we characterize internal components that are critical in solving our logic problem. Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.</p>

<p>Abstract: Free-text radiology reports present a rich data source for various medical tasks, but effectively labeling these texts remains challenging. Traditional rule-based labeling methods fall short of capturing the nuances of diverse free-text patterns. Moreover, models using expert-annotated data are limited by data scarcity and pre-defined classes, impacting their performance, flexibility and scalability. To address these issues, our study offers three main contributions: 1) We demonstrate the potential of GPT as an adept labeler using carefully designed prompts. 2) Utilizing only the data labeled by GPT, we trained a BERT-based labeler, CheX-GPT, which operates faster and more efficiently than its GPT counterpart. 3) To benchmark labeler performance, we introduced a publicly available expert-annotated test set, MIMIC-500, comprising 500 cases from the MIMIC validation set. Our findings demonstrate that CheX-GPT not only excels in labeling accuracy over existing models, but also showcases superior efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, supported by our introduction of the MIMIC-500 dataset for robust benchmarking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Behzad Shayegh, Yuqiao Wen, Lili Mou</p>
<p>Abstract: We address unsupervised discontinuous constituency parsing, where we observe a high variance in the performance of the only previous model in the literature. We propose to build an ensemble of different runs of the existing discontinuous parser by averaging the predicted trees, to stabilize and boost performance. To begin with, we provide comprehensive computational complexity analysis (in terms of P and NP-complete) for tree averaging under different setups of binarity and continuity. We then develop an efficient exact algorithm to tackle the task, which runs in a reasonable time for all samples in our experiments. Results on three datasets show our method outperforms all baselines in all metrics; we also provide in-depth analyses of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one core principle for large-scale pretraining. The existing scaling law demonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training flops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for large language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's compression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with the ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works attempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as hyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic differences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the aforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of model capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through this analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar training dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion parameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and OpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers valuable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification and exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we provide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different models and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training phases. Based on these findings, we provide a more user-friendly strategy for evaluating the optimization state, offering guidance for establishing a stable pretraining process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kosuke Takahashi, Takahiro Omi, Kosuke Arima, Tatsuya Ishigaki</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various languages has been advancing, but the combination of non-English languages with domain-specific contexts remains underexplored. This paper presents our findings from training and evaluating a Japanese business domain-specific LLM designed to better understand business-related documents, such as the news on current affairs, technical reports, and patents. Additionally, LLMs in this domain require regular updates to incorporate the most recent knowledge. Therefore, we also report our findings from the first experiments and evaluations involving updates to this LLM using the latest article data, which is an important problem setting that has not been addressed in previous research. From our experiments on a newly created benchmark dataset for question answering in the target domain, we found that (1) our pretrained model improves QA accuracy without losing general knowledge, and (2) a proper mixture of the latest and older texts in the training data for the update is necessary. Our pretrained model and business domain benchmark are publicly available to support further studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhao Zhu, Shujian Huang, Fei Yuan, Cheng Chen, Jiajun Chen, Alexandra Birch</p>
<p>Abstract: Bridging the significant gap between large language model's English and non-English performance presents a great challenge. While some previous studies attempt to mitigate this gap with translated training data, the recently proposed question alignment framework leverages the model's English expertise to improve multilingual performance with minimum usage of expensive, error-prone translation. In this paper, we explore how broadly this method can be applied by examining its effects in reasoning with and without chain-of-thought, as well as with program-of-thought. We also explore applying this framework to extremely large language models in an efficient manner, such as through proxy-tuning. Experiment results on multilingual reasoning benchmarks mGSM, mSVAMP, xCSQA and xNLI demonstrate that we can extend question alignment framework to boost multilingual performance across diverse reasoning scenarios, model families, and sizes. For instance, when applied to the LLaMA2 models, it brings an average accuracy improvements of 12.2% on mGSM even with the 70B model. To understand the mechanism of its success, we analyze representation space, generated response and data scales, and reveal how question translation training strengthens language alignment within LLMs and shapes their working patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wu, Lutao Yan, Leixian Shen, Yunhai Wang, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart question answering (ChartQA) tasks play a critical role in interpreting and extracting insights from visualization charts. While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o have shown promise in high-level ChartQA tasks, such as chart captioning, their effectiveness in low-level ChartQA tasks (e.g., identifying correlations) remains underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating MLLMs on low-level ChartQA using a newly curated dataset, ChartInsights, which consists of 22,347 (chart, task, query, answer) covering 10 data analysis tasks across 7 chart types. We systematically evaluate 19 advanced MLLMs, including 12 open-source and 7 closed-source models. The average accuracy rate across these models is 39.8%, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy at 69.17%. To further explore the limitations of MLLMs in low-level ChartQA, we conduct experiments that alter visual elements of charts (e.g., changing color schemes, adding image noise) to assess their impact on the task effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose a new textual prompt strategy, Chain-of-Charts, tailored for low-level ChartQA tasks, which boosts performance by 14.41%, achieving an accuracy of 83.58%. Finally, incorporating a visual prompt strategy that directs attention to relevant visual elements further improves accuracy to 84.32%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Belouadi, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Steffen Eger</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating high-quality scientific figures can be time-consuming and challenging, even though sketching ideas on paper is relatively easy. Furthermore, recreating existing figures that are not stored in formats preserving semantic information is equally complex. To tackle this problem, we introduce DeTikZify, a novel multimodal language model that automatically synthesizes scientific figures as semantics-preserving TikZ graphics programs based on sketches and existing figures. To achieve this, we create three new datasets: DaTikZv2, the largest TikZ dataset to date, containing over 360k human-created TikZ graphics; SketchFig, a dataset that pairs hand-drawn sketches with their corresponding scientific figures; and MetaFig, a collection of diverse scientific figures and associated metadata. We train DeTikZify on MetaFig and DaTikZv2, along with synthetically generated sketches learned from SketchFig. We also introduce an MCTS-based inference algorithm that enables DeTikZify to iteratively refine its outputs without the need for additional training. Through both automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that DeTikZify outperforms commercial Claude 3 and GPT-4V in synthesizing TikZ programs, with the MCTS algorithm effectively boosting its performance. We make our code, models, and datasets publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuri Kuratov, Aydar Bulatov, Petr Anokhin, Ivan Rodkin, Dmitry Sorokin, Artyom Sorokin, Mikhail Burtsev</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the input context sizes of large language models (LLMs) have increased dramatically. However, existing evaluation methods have not kept pace, failing to comprehensively assess the efficiency of models in handling long contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce the BABILong benchmark, designed to test language models' ability to reason across facts distributed in extremely long documents. BABILong includes a diverse set of 20 reasoning tasks, including fact chaining, simple induction, deduction, counting, and handling lists/sets. These tasks are challenging on their own, and even more demanding when the required facts are scattered across long natural text. Our evaluations show that popular LLMs effectively utilize only 10-20\% of the context and their performance declines sharply with increased reasoning complexity. Among alternatives to in-context reasoning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods achieve a modest 60\% accuracy on single-fact question answering, independent of context length. Among context extension methods, the highest performance is demonstrated by recurrent memory transformers after fine-tuning, enabling the processing of lengths up to 50 million tokens. The BABILong benchmark is extendable to any length to support the evaluation of new upcoming models with increased capabilities, and we provide splits up to 10 million token lengths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuying Wei, Skander Moalla, Razvan Pascanu, Caglar Gulcehre</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art results in large language models (LLMs) often rely on scale, which becomes computationally expensive. This has sparked a research agenda to reduce these models' parameter counts and computational costs without significantly impacting their performance. Our study focuses on transformer-based LLMs, specifically targeting the computationally intensive feedforward networks (FFNs), which are less studied than attention blocks. We consider three structured linear parameterizations of the FFN using efficient low-rank and block-diagonal matrices. In contrast to many previous works that examined these approximations, our study i) explores these structures from a training-from-scratch perspective, ii) scales up to 1.3B parameters, and iii) is conducted within recent Transformer-based LLMs rather than convolutional architectures. We demonstrate that these structures can lead to actual computational gains in various scenarios, including online decoding when using a pre-merge technique. Additionally, we propose a novel training regime, called \textit{self-guided training}, aimed at improving the poor training dynamics that these approximations exhibit when used from initialization. Interestingly, the scaling performance of structured matrices is explored, revealing steeper curves in scaling training FLOPs, along with a favorable scaling trend in the overtraining regime. Specifically, we show that wide and structured networks can utilize training FLOPs more efficiently, with fewer parameters and lower loss than dense models at their optimal trade-off.

Our evaluation framework includes an evaluation dataset and two evaluation modes. The evaluation dataset is constructed using an LLM-human cooperative approach and simulates an authentic workflow by leveraging consecutive and interactive IPython sessions. The two evaluation modes assess LLMs' ability with and without human assistance. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the ability of 24 LLMs on CIBench and provide valuable insights for future LLMs in code interpreter utilization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate nutrition estimation helps people make informed dietary choices and is essential in the prevention of serious health complications. We present NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal description nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 11,857 meal descriptions generated from real-world global dietary intake data. The data is human-verified and annotated with macro-nutrient labels, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. We conduct an extensive evaluation of NutriBench on the task of carbohydrate estimation, testing twelve leading Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Llama3.1, Qwen2, Gemma2, and OpenBioLLM models, using standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies. Additionally, we present a study involving professional nutritionists, finding that LLMs can provide more accurate and faster estimates. Finally, we perform a real-world risk assessment by simulating the effect of carbohydrate predictions on the blood glucose levels of individuals with diabetes. Our work highlights the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation, demonstrating their potential to aid professionals and laypersons and improve health outcomes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silviu Pitis, Ziang Xiao, Nicolas Le Roux, Alessandro Sordoni</p>
<p>Abstract: While finetuning language models from pairwise preferences has proven remarkably effective, the underspecified nature of natural language presents critical challenges. Direct preference feedback is uninterpretable, difficult to provide where multidimensional criteria may apply, and often inconsistent, either because it is based on incomplete instructions or provided by diverse principals. To address these challenges, we consider the two-step preference modeling procedure that first resolves the under-specification by selecting a context, and then evaluates preference with respect to the chosen context. We decompose reward modeling error according to these two steps, which suggests that supervising context in addition to context-specific preference may be a viable approach to aligning models with diverse human preferences. For this to work, the ability of models to evaluate context-specific preference is critical. To this end, we contribute context-conditioned preference datasets and accompanying experiments that investigate the ability of language models to evaluate context-specific preference. We use our datasets to (1) show that existing preference models benefit from, but fail to fully consider, added context, (2) finetune a context-aware reward model with context-specific performance exceeding that of GPT-4 and Llama 3 70B on tested datasets, and (3) investigate the value of context-aware preference modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shantanu Ghosh, Rayan Syed, Chenyu Wang, Clare B. Poynton, Shyam Visweswaran, Kayhan Batmanghelich</p>
<p>Abstract: Error slice discovery associates structured patterns with model errors. Existing methods discover error slices by clustering the error-prone samples with similar patterns or assigning discrete attributes to each sample for post-hoc analysis. While these methods aim for interpretability and easier mitigation through reweighting or rebalancing, they may not capture the full complexity of error patterns due to incomplete or missing attributes. Contrary to the existing approach, this paper utilizes the reasoning capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze complex error patterns and generate testable hypotheses. This paper proposes LADDER: Language Driven slice Discovery and Error Rectification. It first projects the model's representation into a language-aligned feature space (eg CLIP) to preserve semantics in the original model feature space. This ensures the accurate retrieval of sentences that highlight the model's errors. Next, the LLM utilizes the sentences and generates hypotheses to discover error slices. Finally, we mitigate the error by fine-tuning the classification head by creating a group-balanced dataset using the hypotheses. Our entire method does not require any attribute annotation, either explicitly or through external tagging models. We validate our method with \textbf{five} image classification datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hasan Iqbal, Yuxia Wang, Minghan Wang, Georgi Georgiev, Jiahui Geng, Iryna Gurevych, Preslav Nakov</p>
<p>Abstract: The increased use of large language models (LLMs) across a variety of real-world applications calls for automatic tools to check the factual accuracy of their outputs, as LLMs often hallucinate. This is difficult as it requires assessing the factuality of free-form open-domain responses. While there has been a lot of research on this topic, different papers use different evaluation benchmarks and measures, which makes them hard to compare and hampers future progress. To mitigate these issues, we developed OpenFactCheck, a unified framework, with three modules: (i) RESPONSEEVAL, which allows users to easily customize an automatic fact-checking system and to assess the factuality of all claims in an input document using that system, (ii) LLMEVAL, which assesses the overall factuality of an LLM, and (iii) CHECKEREVAL, a module to evaluate automatic fact-checking systems. OpenFactCheck is open-sourced (https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/openfactcheck) and publicly released as a Python library (https://pypi.org/project/openfactcheck/) and also as a web service (http://app.openfactcheck.com).

We conduct extensive experiments on long context benchmarks, i.e., NaturalQuestions, LongBench, and MuSiQue.

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various natural language generation and understanding tasks. However, their linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael JQ Zhang, Zhilin Wang, Jena D. Hwang, Yi Dong, Olivier Delalleau, Yejin Choi, Eunsol Choi, Xiang Ren, Valentina Pyatkin</p>
<p>Abstract: We examine diverging preferences in human-labeled preference datasets. We develop a taxonomy of disagreement sources spanning 10 categories across four high-level classes -- task underspecification, response style, refusals, and annotation errors. We find that the majority of disagreements are in opposition with standard reward modeling approaches, which are designed with the assumption that annotator disagreement is noise. We then explore how these findings impact two areas of LLM development: reward modeling and evaluation. In our experiments, we demonstrate how standard reward modeling methods, like the Bradley-Terry model, fail to differentiate whether a given preference judgment is the result of unanimous agreement among annotators or the majority opinion among diverging user preferences. We also find that these tendencies are also echoed by popular LLM-as-Judge evaluation methods, which consistently identify a winning response in cases of diverging preferences. These findings highlight remaining challenges in LLM evaluations, which are greatly influenced by divisive features like response style, and in developing pluralistically aligned LLMs. To address these issues, we develop methods for identifying diverging preferences to mitigate their influence on evaluation and training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengyuan Zhang, Chenming Shang, Sizhe Wang, Dongdong Zhang, Renliang Sun, Yiyao Yu, Yujiu Yang, Furu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Although fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multilingual data can rapidly enhance the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit a performance gap between the dominant language (e.g., English) and non-dominant ones due to the imbalance of training data across languages. To further enhance the performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based Contrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of other languages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the representations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace, allowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model parameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their original language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace distance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations and employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the alignment of representations within this area. Experiments demonstrate that our ShifCon framework significantly enhances the performance of non-dominant languages, particularly for low-resource ones. Further analysis offers extra insights to verify the effectiveness of ShifCon and propel future research</p>

<p>Abstract: The massive population election simulation aims to model the preferences of specific groups in particular election scenarios. It has garnered significant attention for its potential to forecast real-world social trends. Traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) methods are constrained by their ability to incorporate complex individual background information and provide interactive prediction results. In this paper, we introduce ElectionSim, an innovative election simulation framework based on large language models, designed to support accurate voter simulations and customized distributions, together with an interactive platform to dialogue with simulated voters. We present a million-level voter pool sampled from social media platforms to support accurate individual simulation. We also introduce PPE, a poll-based presidential election benchmark to assess the performance of our framework under the U.S. presidential election scenario. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework in U.S. presidential election simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sumit Asthana, Hannah Rashkin, Elizabeth Clark, Fantine Huot, Mirella Lapata</p>
<p>Abstract: One useful application of NLP models is to support people in reading complex text from unfamiliar domains (e.g., scientific articles). Simplifying the entire text makes it understandable but sometimes removes important details. On the contrary, helping adult readers understand difficult concepts in context can enhance their vocabulary and knowledge. In a preliminary human study, we first identify that lack of context and unfamiliarity with difficult concepts is a major reason for adult readers' difficulty with domain-specific text. We then introduce "targeted concept simplification," a simplification task for rewriting text to help readers comprehend text containing unfamiliar concepts. We also introduce WikiDomains, a new dataset of 22k definitions from 13 academic domains paired with a difficult concept within each definition. We benchmark the performance of open-source and commercial LLMs and a simple dictionary baseline on this task across human judgments of ease of understanding and meaning preservation. Interestingly, our human judges preferred explanations about the difficult concept more than simplification of the concept phrase. Further, no single model achieved superior performance across all quality dimensions, and automated metrics also show low correlations with human evaluations of concept simplification ($\sim0.2$), opening up rich avenues for research on personalized human reading comprehension support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Wang, Yao Lu, Maurice Weber, Max Ryabinin, Yihong Chen, Raphael Tang, Pontus Stenetorp</p>
<p>Abstract: English, as a very high-resource language, enables the pretraining of high-quality large language models (LLMs). The same cannot be said for most other languages, as leading LLMs still underperform for non-English languages, likely due to a gap in the quality and diversity of the available multilingual pretraining corpora. In this work, we find that machine-translated text from a single high-quality source language can contribute significantly to the pretraining of multilingual LLMs. We translate FineWeb-Edu, a high-quality English web dataset, into French, German, and Spanish, resulting in a final 300B-token dataset, which we call TransWeb-Edu, and pretrain a 1.3B-parameter model, CuatroLLM, from scratch on this dataset. Across five non-English reasoning tasks, we show that CuatroLLM matches or outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual models trained using closed data, such as Llama3.2 and Gemma2, despite using an order of magnitude less data, such as about 6% of the tokens used for Llama3.2's training. We further demonstrate that with additional domain-specific pretraining, amounting to less than 1% of TransWeb-Edu, CuatroLLM surpasses the state of the art in multilingual reasoning. To promote reproducibility, we release our corpus, models, and training pipeline under open licenses at hf.co/britllm/CuatroLLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhili Feng, Tanya Marwah, Nicolo Fusi, David Alvarez-Melis, Lester Mackey</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern large language models use a fixed tokenizer to effectively compress text drawn from a source domain. However, applying the same tokenizer to a new target domain often leads to inferior compression, more costly inference, and reduced semantic alignment. To address this deficiency, we introduce Sparse Sinkhorn Token Translation (S2T2). S2T2 trains a tailored tokenizer for the target domain and learns to translate between target and source tokens, enabling more effective reuse of the pre-trained next-source-token predictor. In our experiments with finetuned English language models, S2T2 improves both the perplexity and the compression of out-of-domain protein sequences, outperforming direct finetuning with either the source or target tokenizer. In addition, we find that token translations learned for smaller, less expensive models can be directly transferred to larger, more powerful models to reap the benefits of S2T2 at lower cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gagan Bhatia, El Moatez Billah Nagoudi, Abdellah El Mekki, Fakhraddin Alwajih, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce {\bf Swan}, a family of embedding models centred around the Arabic language, addressing both small-scale and large-scale use cases. Swan includes two variants: Swan-Small, based on ARBERTv2, and Swan-Large, built on ArMistral, a pretrained Arabic large language model. To evaluate these models, we propose ArabicMTEB, a comprehensive benchmark suite that assesses cross-lingual, multi-dialectal, multi-domain, and multi-cultural Arabic text embedding performance, covering eight diverse tasks and spanning 94 datasets. Swan-Large achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming Multilingual-E5-large in most Arabic tasks, while the Swan-Small consistently surpasses Multilingual-E5-base. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that Swan models are both dialectally and culturally aware, excelling across various Arabic domains while offering significant monetary efficiency. This work significantly advances the field of Arabic language modelling and provides valuable resources for future research and applications in Arabic natural language processing. Our models and benchmark will be made publicly accessible for research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baizhou Huang, Xiao Pu, Xiaojun Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a prominent technique for LLM-generated content detection by embedding imperceptible patterns. Despite supreme performance, its robustness against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. Previous work typically considers a grey-box attack setting, where the specific type of watermark is already known. Some even necessitates knowledge about hyperparameters of the watermarking method. Such prerequisites are unattainable in real-world scenarios. Targeting at a more realistic black-box threat model with fewer assumptions, we here propose $\mathcal{B}^4$, a black-box scrubbing attack on watermarks. Specifically, we formulate the watermark scrubbing attack as a constrained optimization problem by capturing its objectives with two distributions, a Watermark Distribution and a Fidelity Distribution. This optimization problem can be approximately solved using two proxy distributions. Experimental results across 12 different settings demonstrate the superior performance of $\mathcal{B}^4$ compared with other baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liat Bezalel, Eyal Orgad, Amir Globerson</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle when prompted to generate content under specific constraints. However, in such cases it is often easy to check whether these constraints are satisfied or violated. Recent works have shown that LLMs can benefit from such "corrective feedback". Here we claim that this skill of LLMs can be significantly enhanced via training. We introduce an RL framework for teaching models to use such rewards, by simulating interaction sessions, and rewarding the model according to its ability to satisfy the constraints. We refer to our method as CORGI (Controlled Generation with RL for Guided Interaction), and evaluate it on a variety of controlled generation tasks using unlabeled training data. We find that CORGI consistently outperforms the baseline reinforcement learning method that does not incorporate conversational feedback. Furthermore, CORGI's interactive framework enables meta-learning, allowing the LLM to generalize better to guided interaction in new tasks. Our results clearly show that conversational optimization, when combined with reinforcement learning, significantly improves the effectiveness of LLMs in controlled generation contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hunyuan-Large, which is currently the largest open-source Transformer-based mixture of experts model, with a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion activation parameters, capable of handling up to 256K tokens. We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior performance across various benchmarks including language understanding and generation, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding, long-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and exhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger LLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale synthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed expert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an expert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the scaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing valuable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization. The code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future innovations and applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Nie, Xiaotian Hou, Shuhang Lin, James Zou, Huaxiu Yao, Linjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hallucinations and non-factual content undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where rigorous control over Type I errors (the conditional probability of incorrectly classifying hallucinations as truthful content) is essential. Despite its importance, formal verification of LLM factuality with such guarantees remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactTest, a novel framework that statistically assesses whether an LLM can confidently provide correct answers to given questions with high-probability correctness guarantees. We formulate factuality testing as hypothesis testing problem to enforce an upper bound of Type I errors at user-specified significance levels. Notably, we prove that our framework also ensures strong Type II error control under mild conditions and can be extended to maintain its effectiveness when covariate shifts exist. %These analyses are amenable to the principled NP framework. Our approach is distribution-free and works for any number of human-annotated samples. It is model-agnostic and applies to any black-box or white-box LM. Extensive experiments on question-answering (QA) and multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that \approach effectively detects hallucinations and improves the model's ability to abstain from answering unknown questions, leading to an over 40% accuracy improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Victor S. Sheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an innovative token representation and update method in a new ultra-small language model: the Wave network. Specifically, we use a complex vector to represent each token, encoding both global and local semantics of the input text. A complex vector consists of two components: a magnitude vector representing the global semantics of the input text, and a phase vector capturing the relationships between individual tokens and global semantics. Experiments on the AG News text classification task demonstrate that, when generating complex vectors from randomly initialized token embeddings, our single-layer Wave Network achieves 90.91% accuracy with wave interference and 91.66% with wave modulation - outperforming a single Transformer layer using BERT pre-trained embeddings by 19.23% and 19.98%, respectively, and approaching the accuracy of the pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT base model (94.64%). Additionally, compared to BERT base, the Wave Network reduces video memory usage and training time by 77.34% and 85.62% during wave modulation. In summary, we used a 2.4-million-parameter small language model to achieve accuracy comparable to a 100-million-parameter BERT model in text classification.</p>

However, applying RAG models in Persian language as a low-resource language, poses distinct challenges.

In this paper, we address the challenges towards implementing a real-world RAG system for Persian language called PersianRAG.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yangning Li, Yinghui Li, Xinyu Wang, Yong Jiang, Zhen Zhang, Xinran Zheng, Hui Wang, Hai-Tao Zheng, Pengjun Xie, Philip S. Yu, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (mRAG) plays an important role in mitigating the "hallucination" issue inherent in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically predefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws cannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question answering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily obtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we first construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of "dynamic" questions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in query, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2) Questions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments on Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient and precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid retrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning agent for multimodal retrieval, OmniSearch. The underlying idea is to emulate the human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex multimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our OmniSearch, also provide direction for advancing mRAG. The code and dataset will be open-sourced at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/OmniSearch.</p>

However, obtaining keyphrase-labeled documents can be challenging and costly. To address this issue, we present a self-compositional data augmentation method. More specifically, we measure the relatedness of training documents based on their shared keyphrases, and combine similar documents to generate synthetic samples. The advantage of our method lies in its ability to create additional training samples that keep domain coherence, without relying on external data or resources. Our results on multiple datasets spanning three different domains, demonstrate that our method consistently improves keyphrase generation. A qualitative analysis of the generated keyphrases for the Computer Science domain confirms this improvement towards their representativity property.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Goitom Ybrah Hailu, Hadush Hailu, Shishay Welay</p>
<p>Abstract: University students often spend a considerable amount of time seeking answers to common questions from administrators or teachers. This can become tedious for both parties, leading to a need for a solution. In response, this paper proposes a chatbot model that utilizes natural language processing and deep learning techniques to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) in the Amharic language. Chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), acting as a virtual assistant to handle questions and other tasks. The proposed chatbot program employs tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, and stemming to analyze and categorize Amharic input sentences. Three machine learning model algorithms were used to classify tokens and retrieve appropriate responses: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Na\"ive Bayes, and deep neural networks implemented through TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK. The deep learning model achieved the best results with 91.55% accuracy and a validation loss of 0.3548 using an Adam optimizer and SoftMax activation function. The chatbot model was integrated with Facebook Messenger and deployed on a Heroku server for 24-hour accessibility. The experimental results demonstrate that the chatbot framework achieved its objectives and effectively addressed challenges such as Amharic Fidel variation, morphological variation, and lexical gaps. Future research could explore the integration of Amharic WordNet to narrow the lexical gap and support more complex questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunghyeon Woo, Baeseong Park, Byeongwook Kim, Minjung Jo, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsuk Jeon, Dongsoo Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, training these LLMs typically involves substantial memory and computational costs during both forward and backward propagation. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory associated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational costs and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward Propagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs and activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers during backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training shallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections. Additionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an appropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not only applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated with all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation. Specifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy to the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5x, and enable training with a sequence length 6.2x larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU. Furthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100 GPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU. The code is available at https://github.com/WooSunghyeon/dropbp.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in executing complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks and can be manipulated to produce harmful outputs. Recently, a growing body of research has categorized jailbreak attacks into token-level and prompt-level attacks. However, previous work primarily overlooks the diverse key factors of jailbreak attacks, with most studies concentrating on LLM vulnerabilities and lacking exploration of defense-enhanced LLMs. To address these issues, we introduced $\textbf{JailTrickBench}$ to evaluate the impact of various attack settings on LLM performance and provide a baseline for jailbreak attacks, encouraging the adoption of a standardized evaluation framework. Specifically, we evaluate the eight key factors of implementing jailbreak attacks on LLMs from both target-level and attack-level perspectives. We further conduct seven representative jailbreak attacks on six defense methods across two widely used datasets, encompassing approximately 354 experiments with about 55,000 GPU hours on A800-80G. Our experimental results highlight the need for standardized benchmarking to evaluate these attacks on defense-enhanced LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/JailTrickBench.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LiveMind, a novel low-latency inference framework for large language model (LLM) inference which enables LLMs to perform inferences with incomplete user input. By reallocating computational processes to the input phase, a substantial reduction in latency is achieved, thereby significantly enhancing the interactive experience for users of LLMs. The framework adeptly manages the visibility of the streaming input to the model, allowing it to infer from incomplete user input or await additional content. Compared with traditional inference methods on complete user input, our approach demonstrates an average reduction in response latency of 84.0% on the MMLU dataset and 71.6% on the MMLU-Pro dataset, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Additionally, our framework facilitates collaborative inference and output across different models. By employing an large LLM for inference and a small LLM for output, we achieve an average 37% reduction in response latency, alongside a 4.30% improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro dataset compared with the baseline. The proposed LiveMind framework advances the field of human-AI interaction by enabling more responsive and efficient communication between users and AI systems.</p>

The evaluation targets three main aspects: speech understanding, audio scene understanding, and voice understanding (paralinguistic). Despite recent advancements, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark for AudioLLMs on instruction following capabilities conditioned on audio signals. AudioBench addresses this gap by setting up datasets as well as desired evaluation metrics. Besides, we also evaluated the capabilities of five popular models and found that no single model excels consistently across all tasks. We outline the research outlook for AudioLLMs and anticipate that our open-sourced evaluation toolkit, data, and leaderboard will offer a robust testbed for future model developments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Walter Simoncini, Spyros Gidaris, Andrei Bursuc, Yuki M. Asano</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces FUNGI, Features from UNsupervised GradIents, a method to enhance the features of transformer encoders by leveraging self-supervised gradients. Our method is simple: given any pretrained model, we first compute gradients from various self-supervised objectives for each input. These gradients are projected to a lower dimension and then concatenated with the model's output embedding. The resulting features are evaluated on k-nearest neighbor classification over 11 datasets from vision, 5 from natural language processing, and 2 from audio. Across backbones spanning various sizes and pretraining strategies, FUNGI features provide consistent performance improvements over the embeddings. We also show that using FUNGI features can benefit linear classification, clustering and image retrieval, and that they significantly improve the retrieval-based in-context scene understanding abilities of pretrained models, for example improving upon DINO by +17% for semantic segmentation - without any training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Peng, Lei Cui, Wei Cai, Zhenquan Ding, Zhiyu Hao, Xiaochun Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is the task of identifying the application or service associated with encrypted network traffic. One effective approach for this task is to use deep learning methods to encode the raw traffic bytes directly and automatically extract features for classification (byte-based models). However, current byte-based models input raw traffic bytes, whether plaintext or encrypted text, for automated feature extraction, neglecting the distinct impacts of plaintext and encrypted text on downstream tasks. Additionally, these models primarily focus on improving classification accuracy, with little emphasis on the efficiency of models. In this paper, for the first time, we analyze the impact of plaintext and encrypted text on the model's effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our observations and findings, we propose a two-phase approach to balance the trade-off between plaintext and encrypted text in traffic classification. Specifically, Stage one is to Determine whether the Plain text is enough to be accurately Classified (DPC) using the proposed DPC Selector. This stage quickly identifies samples that can be classified using plaintext, leveraging explicit byte features in plaintext to enhance model's efficiency. Stage two aims to adaptively make a classification with the result from stage one. This stage incorporates encrypted text information for samples that cannot be classified using plaintext alone, ensuring the model's effectiveness on traffic classification tasks. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivi Chatzi, Nina Corvelo Benz, Eleni Straitouri, Stratis Tsirtsis, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: "Sure, I am happy to generate a story for you: Captain Lyra stood at the helm of her trusty ship, the Maelstrom's Fury, gazing out at the endless sea. [...] Lyra's eyes welled up with tears as she realized the bitter truth - she had sacrificed everything for fleeting riches, and lost the love of her crew, her family, and herself." Although this story, generated by a large language model, is captivating, one may wonder -- how would the story have unfolded if the model had chosen "Captain Maeve" as the protagonist instead? We cannot know. State-of-the-art large language models are stateless -- they maintain no internal memory or state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as an output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reason about counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. In this work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we develop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Our model allows any large language model to perform counterfactual token generation at almost no cost in comparison with vanilla token generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not require any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama 3 8B-Instruct and Ministral-8B-Instruct and conduct a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of counterfactually generated text. We conclude with a demonstrative application of counterfactual token generation for bias detection, unveiling interesting insights about the model of the world constructed by large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Chen, Xianghu Yue, Xiaoxue Gao, Chen Zhang, Luis Fernando D'Haro, Robby T. Tan, Haizhou Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Various audio-LLMs (ALLMs) have been explored recently for tackling different audio tasks simultaneously using a single, unified model. While existing evaluations of ALLMs primarily focus on single-audio tasks, real-world applications often involve processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines and achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without requiring human annotations. The proposed MALLM opens the door for ALLMs towards multi-audio processing era and brings us closer to replicating human auditory capabilities in machines.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08081">Packing Analysis: Packing Is More Appropriate for Large Models or Datasets in Supervised Fine-tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhe Wang, Guoyin Wang, Yizhong Wang, Jiwei Li, Eduard Hovy, Chen Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Packing, initially utilized in the pre-training phase, is an optimization technique designed to maximize hardware resource efficiency by combining different training sequences to fit the model's maximum input length. Although it has demonstrated effectiveness during pre-training, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage on the following points: (1) whether packing can effectively enhance training efficiency while maintaining performance, (2) the suitable size of the model and dataset for fine-tuning with the packing method, and (3) whether packing unrelated or related training samples might cause the model to either excessively disregard or over-rely on the context.
  In this paper, we perform extensive comparisons between SFT methods using padding and packing, covering SFT datasets ranging from 69K to 1.2M and models from 8B to 70B. This provides the first comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of packing versus padding, as well as practical considerations for implementing packing in various training scenarios. Our analysis covers various benchmarks, including knowledge, reasoning, and coding, as well as GPT-based evaluations, time efficiency, and other fine-tuning parameters. We also open-source our code for fine-tuning and evaluation and provide checkpoints fine-tuned on datasets of different sizes, aiming to advance future research on packing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junpeng Liu, Tianyue Ou, Yifan Song, Yuxiao Qu, Wai Lam, Chenyan Xiong, Wenhu Chen, Graham Neubig, Xiang Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-rich visual understanding-the ability to process environments where dense textual content is integrated with visuals-is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interact effectively with structured environments. To enhance this capability, we propose synthesizing general multimodal instructions from webpage UIs using text-based large language models (LLMs). Despite lacking direct visual input, text-based LLMs are able to process structured text representations from webpage accessibility trees. These instructions are then paired with UI screenshots to train multimodal models. We introduce MultiUI, a dataset containing 7.3 million samples from 1 million websites, covering diverse multimodal tasks and UI layouts. Models trained on MultiUI not only excel in web UI tasks-achieving up to a 48% improvement on VisualWebBench and a 19.1% boost in element accuracy on a web agent dataset Mind2Web-but also generalize surprisingly well to non-web UI tasks and even to non-UI domains, such as document understanding, OCR, and chart interpretation. These results highlight the broad applicability of web UI data for advancing text-rich visual understanding across various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longxuan Yu, Delin Chen, Siheng Xiong, Qingyang Wu, Qingzhen Liu, Dawei Li, Zhikai Chen, Xiaoze Liu, Liangming Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal reasoning (CR) is a crucial aspect of intelligence, essential for problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding the world. While large language models (LLMs) can generate rationales for their outputs, their ability to reliably perform causal reasoning remains uncertain, often falling short in tasks requiring a deep understanding of causality. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of research aimed at enhancing LLMs for causal reasoning. We categorize existing methods based on the role of LLMs: either as reasoning engines or as helpers providing knowledge or data to traditional CR methods, followed by a detailed discussion of the methodologies in each category. We then evaluate the performance of LLMs on various causal reasoning tasks, providing key findings and in-depth analysis. Finally, we provide insights from current studies and highlight promising directions for future research. We aim for this work to serve as a comprehensive resource, fostering further advancements in causal reasoning with LLMs. Resources are available at https://github.com/chendl02/Awesome-LLM-causal-reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.</p>
