<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesse Atuhurra, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Hiroki Ouchi, Hiroyuki Shindo, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting named entity recognition (NER) methods to new domains poses significant challenges. We introduce RapidNER, a framework designed for the rapid deployment of NER systems through efficient dataset construction. RapidNER operates through three key steps: (1) extracting domain-specific sub-graphs and triples from a general knowledge graph, (2) collecting and leveraging texts from various sources to build the NERsocial dataset, which focuses on entities typical in human-robot interaction, and (3) implementing an annotation scheme using Elasticsearch (ES) to enhance efficiency. NERsocial, validated by human annotators, includes six entity types, 153K tokens, and 99.4K sentences, demonstrating RapidNER's capability to expedite dataset creation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09722">GReaTer: Gradients over Reasoning Makes Smaller Language Models Strong Prompt Optimizers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Ryo Kamoi, Bo Pang, Yusen Zhang, Caiming Xiong, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to the design of prompts, making prompt optimization essential for enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Many existing approaches to automating prompt engineering rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining prompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally expensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality feedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover, these methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such as gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce GReaTer, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates gradient information over task-specific reasoning. By utilizing task loss gradients, GReaTer enables self-optimization of prompts for open-source, lightweight language models without the need for costly closed-source LLMs. This allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive LLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning often needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse reasoning tasks including BBH, GSM8k, and FOLIO demonstrate that GReaTer consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, even those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, GReaTer-optimized prompts frequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task performance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger language models, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt optimization guided by gradients over reasoning. Code of GReaTer is available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/GreaTer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent-Pierre Berges, Barlas O\u{g}uz, Daniel Haziza, Wen-tau Yih, Luke Zettlemoyer, Gargi Gosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory layers use a trainable key-value lookup mechanism to add extra parameters to a model without increasing FLOPs. Conceptually, sparsely activated memory layers complement compute-heavy dense feed-forward layers, providing dedicated capacity to store and retrieve information cheaply. This work takes memory layers beyond proof-of-concept, proving their utility at contemporary scale. On downstream tasks, language models augmented with our improved memory layer outperform dense models with more than twice the computation budget, as well as mixture-of-expert models when matched for both compute and parameters. We find gains are especially pronounced for factual tasks. We provide a fully parallelizable memory layer implementation, demonstrating scaling laws with up to 128B memory parameters, pretrained to 1 trillion tokens, comparing to base models with up to 8B parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhao Lin, Yifei Wang, Yanwu Xu, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite multimodal sentiment analysis being a fertile research ground that merits further investigation, current approaches take up high annotation cost and suffer from label ambiguity, non-amicable to high-quality labeled data acquisition. Furthermore, choosing the right interactions is essential because the significance of intra- or inter-modal interactions can differ among various samples. To this end, we propose Semi-IIN, a Semi-supervised Intra-inter modal Interaction learning Network for multimodal sentiment analysis. Semi-IIN integrates masked attention and gating mechanisms, enabling effective dynamic selection after independently capturing intra- and inter-modal interactive information. Combined with the self-training approach, Semi-IIN fully utilizes the knowledge learned from unlabeled data. Experimental results on two public datasets, MOSI and MOSEI, demonstrate the effectiveness of Semi-IIN, establishing a new state-of-the-art on several metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyao Wang, Shiwen Ni, Huaren Liu, Shule Lu, Guhong Chen, Xi Feng, Chi Wei, Qiang Qu, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Yuan Lin, Min Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, the field of patent processing has garnered increased attention within the natural language processing community. However, the majority of research has been concentrated on classification tasks, such as patent categorization and examination, or on short text generation tasks like patent summarization and patent quizzes. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical task known as Draft2Patent, along with its corresponding D2P benchmark, which challenges LLMs to generate full-length patents averaging 17K tokens based on initial drafts. Patents present a significant challenge to LLMs due to their specialized nature, standardized terminology, and extensive length. We propose a multi-agent framework called AutoPatent which leverages the LLM-based planner agent, writer agents, and examiner agent with PGTree and RRAG to generate lengthy, intricate, and high-quality complete patent documents. The experimental results demonstrate that our AutoPatent framework significantly enhances the ability to generate comprehensive patents across various LLMs. Furthermore, we have discovered that patents generated solely with the AutoPatent framework based on the Qwen2.5-7B model outperform those produced by larger and more powerful LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-72B, and LLAMA3.1-70B, in both objective metrics and human evaluations. We will make the data and code available upon acceptance at \url{https://github.com/QiYao-Wang/AutoPatent}.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09807">LLM Distillation for Efficient Few-Shot Multiple Choice Question Answering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Sutanto, Joan Santoso</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is an important problem with numerous real-world applications, such as medicine, law, and education. The high cost of building MCQA datasets makes few-shot learning pivotal in this domain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can enable few-shot learning, their direct application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by their high computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that uses LLMs for data generation and scoring. Our approach utilizes LLMs to create MCQA data which contains questions and choices, and to assign probability scores to the generated choices. We then use the generated data and LLM-assigned scores to finetune a smaller and more efficient encoder-only model, DeBERTa-v3-base by leveraging distillation loss. Extensive experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark demonstrate that our method improves accuracy from 28.9% to 39.3%, representing a gain of over 10% compared to a baseline finetuned directly on 5-shot examples. This shows the effectiveness of LLM-driven data generation and knowledge distillation for few-shot MCQA.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09812">ScaleOT: Privacy-utility-scalable Offsite-tuning with Dynamic LayerReplace and Selective Rank Compression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yao, Zhaorui Tan, Tiandi Ye, Lichun Li, Yuan Zhao, Wenyan Liu, Wei Wang, Jianke Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Offsite-tuning is a privacy-preserving method for tuning large language models (LLMs) by sharing a lossy compressed emulator from the LLM owners with data owners for downstream task tuning. This approach protects the privacy of both the model and data owners. However, current offsite tuning methods often suffer from adaptation degradation, high computational costs, and limited protection strength due to uniformly dropping LLM layers or relying on expensive knowledge distillation. To address these issues, we propose ScaleOT, a novel privacy-utility-scalable offsite-tuning framework that effectively balances privacy and utility. ScaleOT introduces a novel layerwise lossy compression algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to obtain the importance of each layer. It employs lightweight networks, termed harmonizers, to replace the raw LLM layers. By combining important original LLM layers and harmonizers in different ratios, ScaleOT generates emulators tailored for optimal performance with various model scales for enhanced privacy protection. Additionally, we present a rank reduction method to further compress the original LLM layers, significantly enhancing privacy with negligible impact on utility. Comprehensive experiments show that ScaleOT can achieve nearly lossless offsite tuning performance compared with full fine-tuning while obtaining better model privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changqun Li, Chaofan Ding, Kexin Luan, Xinhan Di</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. LoRA is one of the most widely used methods, which assumes that the optimization process is essentially low dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, there remains a significant performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning when learning new tasks. In this work, we propose Low-Rank Adaptation with Task-Relevant Feature Enhancement(LoRATRF) for enhancing task-relevant features from the perspective of editing neural network representations. To prioritize task-relevant features, a task-aware filter that selectively extracts valuable knowledge from hidden representations for the target or current task is designed. As the experiments on a vareity of datasets including NLU, commonsense reasoning and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrates, our method reduces 33.71% parameters and achieves better performance on a variety of datasets in comparison with SOTA low-rank methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first FLOP controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cassie Huang, Li Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to fail to create executable and verifiable plans in grounded environments. An emerging line of work shows success in using LLM as a formalizer to generate a formal representation (e.g., PDDL) of the planning domain, which can be deterministically solved to find a plan. We systematically evaluate this methodology while bridging some major gaps. While previous work only generates a partial PDDL representation given templated and thus unrealistic environment descriptions, we generate the complete representation given descriptions of various naturalness levels. Among an array of observations critical to improve LLMs' formal planning ability, we note that large enough models can effectively formalize descriptions as PDDL, outperforming those directly generating plans, while being robust to lexical perturbation. As the descriptions become more natural-sounding, we observe a decrease in performance and provide detailed error analysis.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09884">Benchmarking Table Comprehension In The Wild</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikang Pan, Yi Zhu, Rand Xie, Yizhi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), while being increasingly dominant on a myriad of knowledge-intensive activities, have only had limited success understanding lengthy table-text mixtures, such as academic papers and financial reports. Recent advances of long-context LLMs have opened up new possibilities for this field. Nonetheless, we identify two roadblocks: (1) Prior benchmarks of table question answering (TableQA) have focused on isolated tables without context, making it hard to evaluate models in real-world scenarios. (2) Prior benchmarks have focused on some narrow skill sets of table comprehension such as table recognition, data manipulation/calculation, table summarization etc., while a skilled human employs those skills collectively. In this work, we introduce TableQuest, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the holistic table comprehension capabilities of LLMs in the natural table-rich context of financial reports. We employ a rigorous data processing and filtering procedure to ensure that the question-answer pairs are logical, reasonable, and diverse. We experiment with 7 state-of-the-art models, and find that despite reasonable accuracy in locating facts, they often falter when required to execute more sophisticated reasoning or multi-step calculations. We conclude with a qualitative study of the failure modes and discuss the challenges of constructing a challenging benchmark. We make the evaluation data, judging procedure and results of this study publicly available to facilitate research in this field.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09906">Enhancing the Reasoning Capabilities of Small Language Models via Solution Guidance Fine-Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Bi, Yuting Wu, Weiwei Xing, Zhenjie Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Advances in prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques have further enhanced their ability to address complex reasoning challenges. However, these advanced capabilities are often exclusive to models exceeding 100 billion parameters. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning methods have been explored for smaller models (under 10 billion parameters), they typically depend on extensive CoT training data, which can introduce inconsistencies and limit effectiveness in low-data settings. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduce a new reasoning strategy Solution Guidance (SG) and a plug-and-play training paradigm Solution-Guidance Fine-Tuning (SGFT) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models. SG focuses on problem understanding and decomposition at the semantic and logical levels, rather than specific computations, which can effectively improve the SLMs' generalization and reasoning abilities. With only a small amount of SG training data, SGFT can fine-tune a SLM to produce accurate problem-solving guidances, which can then be flexibly fed to any SLM as prompts, enabling it to generate correct answers directly. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of SLMs on various reasoning tasks, enhancing both their practicality and efficiency within resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxu Mao, Peipei Liu, Tiehan Cui, Congying Liu, Datao You</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, text classification methods based on neural networks and pre-trained models have gained increasing attention and demonstrated excellent performance. However, these methods still have some limitations in practical applications: (1) They typically focus only on the matching similarity between sentences. However, there exists implicit high-value information both within sentences of the same class and across different classes, which is very crucial for classification tasks. (2) Existing methods such as pre-trained language models and graph-based approaches often consume substantial memory for training and text-graph construction. (3) Although some low-resource methods can achieve good performance, they often suffer from excessively long processing times. To address these challenges, we propose a low-resource and fast text classification model called LFTC. Our approach begins by constructing a compressor list for each class to fully mine the regularity information within intra-class data. We then remove redundant information irrelevant to the target classification to reduce processing time. Finally, we compute the similarity distance between text pairs for classification. We evaluate LFTC on 9 publicly available benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate significant improvements in performance and processing time, especially under limited computational and data resources, highlighting its superior advantages.</p>

In this work, we propose \texttt{SuperNUGGETS}, an improved variant of \texttt{NUGGETS} optimised for efficiency and performance. Our \texttt{SuperNUGGETS} uses a small language model (SLM) instead of a large language model (LLM) to filter the data for outstanding one-shot instances and refines the predefined set of tests. The experimental results show that the performance of \texttt{SuperNUGGETS} only decreases by 1-2% compared to \texttt{NUGGETS}, but the efficiency can be increased by a factor of 58. Compared to the original \texttt{NUGGETS}, our \texttt{SuperNUGGETS} has a higher utility value due to the significantly lower resource consumption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Rezaeimanesh, Faezeh Hosseini, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown superior capabilities in translating figurative language compared to neural machine translation (NMT) systems. However, the impact of different prompting methods and LLM-NMT combinations on idiom translation has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This paper introduces two parallel datasets of sentences containing idiomatic expressions for Persian$\rightarrow$English and English$\rightarrow$Persian translations, with Persian idioms sampled from our PersianIdioms resource, a collection of 2,200 idioms and their meanings. Using these datasets, we evaluate various open- and closed-source LLMs, NMT models, and their combinations. Translation quality is assessed through idiom translation accuracy and fluency. We also find that automatic evaluation methods like LLM-as-a-judge, BLEU and BERTScore are effective for comparing different aspects of model performance. Our experiments reveal that Claude-3.5-Sonnet delivers outstanding results in both translation directions. For English$\rightarrow$Persian, combining weaker LLMs with Google Translate improves results, while Persian$\rightarrow$English translations benefit from single prompts for simpler models and complex prompts for advanced ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohui Rao, Haoze Li, Xiaofang Lin, Lijuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: In reading garden-path sentences, people must resolve competing interpretations, though initial misinterpretations can linger despite reanalysis. This study examines the role of inhibitory control (IC) in managing these misinterpretations among Chinese-English bilinguals. Using self-paced reading tasks, we investigated how IC influences recovery from garden-path sentences in Chinese (L1) and its interaction with language proficiency during English (L2) processing. Results indicate that IC does not affect garden-path recovery in Chinese, suggesting reliance on semantic context may reduce the need for IC. In contrast, findings for English L2 learners reveal a complex relationship between language proficiency and IC: Participants with low L2 proficiency but high IC showed lingering misinterpretations, while those with high proficiency exhibited none. These results support and extend the Model of Cognitive Control (Ness et al., 2023). Moreover, our comparison of three Stroop task versions identifies L1 colour-word Stroop task as the preferred measure of IC in bilingual research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anastasia Zhukova, Christian E. Matt, Bela Gipp</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain-specific languages that use a lot of specific terminology often fall into the category of low-resource languages. Collecting test datasets in a narrow domain is time-consuming and requires skilled human resources with domain knowledge and training for the annotation task. This study addresses the challenge of automated collecting test datasets to evaluate semantic search in low-resource domain-specific German language of the process industry. Our approach proposes an end-to-end annotation pipeline for automated query generation to the score reassessment of query-document pairs. To overcome the lack of text encoders trained in the German chemistry domain, we explore a principle of an ensemble of "weak" text encoders trained on common knowledge datasets. We combine individual relevance scores from diverse models to retrieve document candidates and relevance scores generated by an LLM, aiming to achieve consensus on query-document alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that the ensemble method significantly improves alignment with human-assigned relevance scores, outperforming individual models in both inter-coder agreement and accuracy metrics. These findings suggest that ensemble learning can effectively adapt semantic search systems for specialized, low-resource languages, offering a practical solution to resource limitations in domain-specific contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debarghya Datta, Soumajit Pramanik</p>
<p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of natural language processing and information retrieval, the need for robust and domain-specific entity linking algorithms has become increasingly apparent. It is crucial in a considerable number of fields such as humanities, technical writing and biomedical sciences to enrich texts with semantics and discover more knowledge. The use of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) in such domains requires handling noisy texts, low resource settings and domain-specific KBs. Existing approaches are mostly inappropriate for such scenarios, as they either depend on training data or are not flexible enough to work with domain-specific KBs. Thus in this work, we present an unsupervised approach leveraging the concept of Group Steiner Trees (GST), which can identify the most relevant candidates for entity disambiguation using the contextual similarities across candidate entities for all the mentions present in a document. We outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by more than 40\% (in avg.) in terms of Precision@1 across various domain-specific datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10056">GAOKAO-Eval: Does high scores truly reflect strong capabilities in LLMs?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhikai Lei, Tianyi Liang, Hanglei Hu, Jin Zhang, Yunhua Zhou, Yunfan Shao, Linyang Li, Chenchui Li, Changbo Wang, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated using human-crafted benchmarks, under the premise that higher scores implicitly reflect stronger human-like performance. However, there is growing concern that LLMs may ``game" these benchmarks due to data leakage, achieving high scores while struggling with tasks simple for humans. To substantively address the problem, we create GAOKAO-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark based on China's National College Entrance Examination (Gaokao), and conduct ``closed-book" evaluations for representative models released prior to Gaokao. Contrary to prevailing consensus, even after addressing data leakage and comprehensiveness, GAOKAO-Eval reveals that high scores still fail to truly reflect human-aligned capabilities. To better understand this mismatch, We introduce the Rasch model from cognitive psychology to analyze LLM scoring patterns and identify two key discrepancies: 1) anomalous consistent performance across various question difficulties, and 2) high variance in performance on questions of similar difficulty. In addition, We identified inconsistent grading of LLM-generated answers among teachers and recurring mistake patterns. we find that the phenomenons are well-grounded in the motivations behind OpenAI o1, and o1's reasoning-as-difficulties can mitigate the mismatch. These results show that GAOKAO-Eval can reveal limitations in LLM capabilities not captured by current benchmarks and highlight the need for more LLM-aligned difficulty analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Arthur Baker, Ankush Raut, Sagi Shaier, Lawrence E Hunter, Katharina von der Wense</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous work finds that recent long-context language models fail to make equal use of information in the middle of their inputs, preferring pieces of information located at the tail ends which creates an undue bias in situations where we would like models to be equally capable of using different parts of the input. Thus far, the problem has mainly only been considered in settings with single pieces of critical information, leading us to question what happens when multiple necessary pieces of information are spread out over the inputs. Here, we demonstrate the effects of the "lost in the middle" problem in the multi-hop question answering setting -- in which multiple reasoning "hops" over disconnected documents are required -- and show that performance degrades not only with respect to the distance of information from the edges of the context, but also between pieces of information. Additionally, we experiment with means of alleviating the problem by reducing superfluous document contents through knowledge graph triple extraction and summarization, and prompting models to reason more thoroughly using chain-of-thought prompting.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we present our submission for the NorSID Shared Task as part of the 2025 VarDial Workshop (Scherrer et al., 2025), consisting of three tasks: Intent Detection, Slot Filling and Dialect Identification, evaluated using data in different dialects of the Norwegian language. For Intent Detection and Slot Filling, we have fine-tuned a multitask model in a cross-lingual setting, to leverage the xSID dataset available in 17 languages. In the case of Dialect Identification, our final submission consists of a model fine-tuned on the provided development set, which has obtained the highest scores within our experiments. Our final results on the test set show that our models do not drop in performance compared to the development set, likely due to the domain-specificity of the dataset and the similar distribution of both subsets. Finally, we also report an in-depth analysis of the provided datasets and their artifacts, as well as other sets of experiments that have been carried out but did not yield the best results. Additionally, we present an analysis on the reasons why some methods have been more successful than others; mainly the impact of the combination of languages and domain-specificity of the training data on the results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyuan Gao, Shubhi Bansal, Kushaan Gowda, Zhu Li, Shekhar Nayak, Nagendra Kumar, Matt Coler</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting sarcasm effectively requires a nuanced understanding of context, including vocal tones and facial expressions. The progression towards multimodal computational methods in sarcasm detection, however, faces challenges due to the scarcity of data. To address this, we present AMuSeD (Attentive deep neural network for MUltimodal Sarcasm dEtection incorporating bi-modal Data augmentation). This approach utilizes the Multimodal Sarcasm Detection Dataset (MUStARD) and introduces a two-phase bimodal data augmentation strategy. The first phase involves generating varied text samples through Back Translation from several secondary languages. The second phase involves the refinement of a FastSpeech 2-based speech synthesis system, tailored specifically for sarcasm to retain sarcastic intonations. Alongside a cloud-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) service, this Fine-tuned FastSpeech 2 system produces corresponding audio for the text augmentations. We also investigate various attention mechanisms for effectively merging text and audio data, finding self-attention to be the most efficient for bimodal integration. Our experiments reveal that this combined augmentation and attention approach achieves a significant F1-score of 81.0% in text-audio modalities, surpassing even models that use three modalities from the MUStARD dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhensheng Wang, Wenmian Yang, Kun Zhou, Yiquan Zhang, Weijia Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: The real estate market relies heavily on structured data, such as property details, market trends, and price fluctuations. However, the lack of specialized Tabular Question Answering datasets in this domain limits the development of automated question-answering systems. To fill this gap, we introduce RETQA, the first large-scale open-domain Chinese Tabular Question Answering dataset for Real Estate. RETQA comprises 4,932 tables and 20,762 question-answer pairs across 16 sub-fields within three major domains: property information, real estate company finance information and land auction information. Compared with existing tabular question answering datasets, RETQA poses greater challenges due to three key factors: long-table structures, open-domain retrieval, and multi-domain queries. To tackle these challenges, we propose the SLUTQA framework, which integrates large language models with spoken language understanding tasks to enhance retrieval and answering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLUTQA significantly improves the performance of large language models on RETQA by in-context learning. RETQA and SLUTQA provide essential resources for advancing tabular question answering research in the real estate domain, addressing critical challenges in open-domain and long-table question-answering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagi Shaier, George Arthur Baker, Chiranthan Sridhar, Lawrence E Hunter, Katharina von der Wense</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) have excelled in various broad domains. However, to ensure their safe and effective integration into real-world educational settings, they must demonstrate proficiency in specific, granular areas of knowledge. Existing cloze-style benchmarks, commonly used to evaluate LMs' knowledge, have three major limitations. They: 1) do not cover the educational domain; 2) typically focus on low-complexity, generic knowledge or broad domains, which do not adequately assess the models' knowledge in specific subjects; and 3) often rely on templates that can bias model predictions. Here, we introduce MALAMUTE, a multilingual, template-free, and highly granular probing dataset comprising expert-written, peer-reviewed probes from 71 university-level textbooks across three languages (English, Spanish, and Polish). MALAMUTE is the first education-based cloze-style dataset. It covers eight domains, each with up to 14 subdomains, further broken down into concepts and concept-based prompts, totaling 33,361 university curriculum concepts and 116,887 prompts. MALAMUTE's fine granularity, educational focus, and inclusion of both sentence-level and paragraph-level prompts make it an ideal tool for evaluating LMs' course-related knowledge. Our evaluation of masked and causal LMs on MALAMUTE shows that despite overall proficiency, they have significant gaps in knowledge when examined closely on specific subjects, hindering their safe use in classrooms and underscoring the need for further development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghua Hou, Shuhui Cao, Deqiang Ouyang, Ning Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: As an algorithmic framework for learning to learn, meta-learning provides a promising solution for few-shot text classification. However, most existing research fail to give enough attention to class labels. Traditional basic framework building meta-learner based on prototype networks heavily relies on inter-class variance, and it is easily influenced by noise. To address these limitations, we proposes a simple and effective few-shot text classification framework. In particular, the corresponding label templates are embed into input sentences to fully utilize the potential value of class labels, guiding the pre-trained model to generate more discriminative text representations through the semantic information conveyed by labels. With the continuous influence of label semantics, supervised contrastive learning is utilized to model the interaction information between support samples and query samples. Furthermore, the averaging mechanism is replaced with an attention mechanism to highlight vital semantic information. To verify the proposed scheme, four typical datasets are employed to assess the performance of different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance enhancements and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on few-shot text classification tasks.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10121">Familiarity: Better Evaluation of Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition by Quantifying Label Shifts in Synthetic Training Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Golde, Patrick Haller, Max Ploner, Fabio Barth, Nicolaas Jedema, Alan Akbik</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot named entity recognition (NER) is the task of detecting named entities of specific types (such as 'Person' or 'Medicine') without any training examples. Current research increasingly relies on large synthetic datasets, automatically generated to cover tens of thousands of distinct entity types, to train zero-shot NER models. However, in this paper, we find that these synthetic datasets often contain entity types that are semantically highly similar to (or even the same as) those in standard evaluation benchmarks. Because of this overlap, we argue that reported F1 scores for zero-shot NER overestimate the true capabilities of these approaches. Further, we argue that current evaluation setups provide an incomplete picture of zero-shot abilities since they do not quantify the label shift (i.e., the similarity of labels) between training and evaluation datasets. To address these issues, we propose Familiarity, a novel metric that captures both the semantic similarity between entity types in training and evaluation, as well as their frequency in the training data, to provide an estimate of label shift. It allows researchers to contextualize reported zero-shot NER scores when using custom synthetic training datasets. Further, it enables researchers to generate evaluation setups of various transfer difficulties for fine-grained analysis of zero-shot NER.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyan Hu, Xue Xiao, Mengqi Zhang, Xiao Chen, Zhaochun Ren, Zhumin Chen, Pengjie Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, traditional full fine-tuning becomes increasingly impractical due to its high computational and storage costs. Although popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, have significantly reduced the number of tunable parameters, there is still room for further optimization. In this work, we propose ASLoRA, a cross-layer parameter-sharing strategy combining global sharing with partial adaptive sharing. Specifically, we share the low-rank matrix A across all layers and adaptively merge matrix B during training. This sharing mechanism not only mitigates overfitting effectively but also captures inter-layer dependencies, significantly enhancing the model's representational capability. We conduct extensive experiments on various NLP tasks, showing that ASLoRA outperforms LoRA while using less than 25% of the parameters, highlighting its flexibility and superior parameter efficiency. Furthermore, in-depth analyses of the adaptive sharing strategy confirm its significant advantages in enhancing both model flexibility and task adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehong Wang, Sidney Liu, Zheyuan Zhang, Tianyi Ma, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous data structures found in numerous real-world applications, such as drug discovery, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to learn node embeddings through message passing on these structures. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to multiple graphs with different feature spaces, as existing GNN architectures are not designed for cross-graph feature alignment. To address this, recent approaches introduce text-attributed graphs, where each node is associated with a textual description, enabling the use of a shared textual encoder to project nodes from different graphs into a unified feature space. While promising, this method relies heavily on the availability of text-attributed data, which can be difficult to obtain in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method named Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs. The key idea is to integrate topological information with each node's properties, enhancing the LLMs' ability to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. We evaluate our TANS on text-rich, text-limited, and text-free graphs, demonstrating that it enables a single GNN to operate across diverse graphs. Notably, on text-free graphs, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches that manually design node features, showcasing the potential of LLMs for preprocessing graph-structured data, even in the absence of textual information.

<p>Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) facilitated by large language models (LLMs), the latest state-of-the-art techniques are still trapped in the in-context learning of closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), which limits their applicability in open scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel RObust mUltitask Tuning and collaboration mEthod (ROUTE) to improve the comprehensive capabilities of open-source LLMs for Text2SQL, thereby providing a more practical solution. Our approach begins with multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using various synthetic training data related to SQL generation. Unlike existing SFT-based Text2SQL methods, we introduced several additional SFT tasks, including schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing. Engaging in a variety of SQL generation tasks enhances the model's understanding of SQL syntax and improves its ability to generate high-quality SQL queries. Additionally, inspired by the collaborative modes of LLM agents, we introduce a Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy. This strategy leverages collaboration across several SQL-related tasks to reduce hallucinations during SQL generation, thereby maximizing the potential of enhancing Text2SQL performance through explicit multitask capabilities. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses have been performed on eight open-source LLMs and five widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the latest Text2SQL methods and yields leading performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingru Li, Han Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The capacity of LLMs to carry out automated qualitative analysis has been questioned by corpus linguists, and it has been argued that corpus-based discourse analysis incorporating LLMs is hindered by issues of unsatisfying performance, hallucination, and irreproducibility. Our proposed method, TACOMORE, aims to address these concerns by serving as an effective prompting framework in this domain. The framework consists of four principles, i.e., Task, Context, Model and Reproducibility, and specifies five fundamental elements of a good prompt, i.e., Role Description, Task Definition, Task Procedures, Contextual Information and Output Format. We conduct experiments on three LLMs, i.e., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro and Gemini-1.5.Flash, and find that TACOMORE helps improve LLM performance in three representative discourse analysis tasks, i.e., the analysis of keywords, collocates and concordances, based on an open corpus of COVID-19 research articles. Our findings show the efficacy of the proposed prompting framework TACOMORE in corpus-based discourse analysis in terms of Accuracy, Ethicality, Reasoning, and Reproducibility, and provide novel insights into the application and evaluation of LLMs in automated qualitative studies.</p>

In this paper, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) for this task and introduce Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing (RASP), a simple yet effective approach that integrates external lexical knowledge into the parsing process. Our experiments not only show that LLMs outperform previous encoder-decoder baselines for semantic parsing, but that RASP further enhances their ability to predict unseen concepts, nearly doubling the performance of previous models on out-of-distribution concepts. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging large language models and retrieval mechanisms for robust and open-domain semantic parsing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arijit Nag, Soumen Chakrabarti, Animesh Mukherjee, Niloy Ganguly</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-source Large Language models (OsLLMs) propel the democratization of natural language research by giving the flexibility to augment or update model parameters for performance improvement. Nevertheless, like proprietary LLMs, Os-LLMs offer poorer performance on low-resource languages (LRLs) than high-resource languages (HRLs), owing to smaller amounts of training data and underrepresented vocabulary. On the other hand, continual pre-training (CPT) with large amounts of language-specific data is a costly proposition in terms of data acquisition and computational resources. Our goal is to drastically reduce CPT cost. To that end, we first develop a new algorithm to select a subset of texts from a larger corpus. We show the effectiveness of our technique using very little CPT data. In search of further improvement, we design a new algorithm to select tokens to include in the LLM vocabulary. We experiment with the recent Llama-3 model and nine Indian languages with diverse scripts and extent of resource availability. For evaluation, we use IndicGenBench, a generation task benchmark dataset for Indic languages. We experiment with various CPT corpora and augmented vocabulary size and offer insights across language families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry J. Davies, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo P. Mandic</p>
<p>Abstract: The sheer scale of data required to train modern large language models (LLMs) poses significant risks, as models are likely to gain knowledge of sensitive topics such as bio-security, as well the ability to replicate copyrighted works. Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt directions, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model performance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS) method of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the LLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a selected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then refines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high probability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and transforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward weight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation space, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are then replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the concept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method allows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the famous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is demonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced to 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the knowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across all languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has minimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse concepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token probabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.002).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqing Yuan, Ruijie Xi, Munindar P. Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Stance detection is crucial for fostering a human-centric Web by analyzing user-generated content to identify biases and harmful narratives that undermine trust. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing approaches treat stance detection as a classification problem, providing robust methodologies for modeling complex group interactions and advancing capabilities in natural language tasks. However, these methods often lack interpretability, limiting their ability to offer transparent and understandable justifications for predictions. This study adopts a generative approach, where stance predictions include explicit, interpretable rationales, and integrates them into smaller language models through single-task and multitask learning. We find that incorporating reasoning into stance detection enables the smaller model (FlanT5) to outperform GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance, achieving an improvement of up to 9.57%. Moreover, our results show that reasoning capabilities enhance multitask learning performance but may reduce effectiveness in single-task settings. Crucially, we demonstrate that faithful rationales improve rationale distillation into SLMs, advancing efforts to build interpretable, trustworthy systems for addressing discrimination, fostering trust, and promoting equitable engagement on social media.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanzhu Guo, Guokan Shang, Chlo\'e Clavel</p>
<p>Abstract: The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily focused on their task-solving capabilities, with recent models even surpassing human performance in some areas. However, this focus often neglects whether machine-generated language matches the human level of diversity, in terms of vocabulary choice, syntactic construction, and expression of meaning, raising questions about whether the fundamentals of language generation have been fully addressed. This paper emphasizes the importance of examining the preservation of human linguistic richness by language models, given the concerning surge in online content produced or aided by LLMs. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs from various linguistic diversity perspectives including lexical, syntactic, and semantic dimensions. Using this framework, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs across all diversity dimensions, and conduct an in-depth case study for syntactic diversity. Finally, we analyze how different development and deployment choices impact the linguistic diversity of LLM outputs.</p>

This study examines who the LLMs view as the most prominent figures across various fields, using prompts in ten different languages to explore the influence of linguistic diversity. Our findings reveal low diversity in responses, with a small number of figures dominating recognition across languages (also known as the "superstar effect").

<p>Abstract: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Coleman Haley, Sharon Goldwater, Edoardo Ponti</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a grounded approach to meaning in language typology. We treat data from perceptual modalities, such as images, as a language-agnostic representation of meaning. Hence, we can quantify the function--form relationship between images and captions across languages. Inspired by information theory, we define "groundedness", an empirical measure of contextual semantic contentfulness (formulated as a difference in surprisal) which can be computed with multilingual multimodal language models. As a proof of concept, we apply this measure to the typology of word classes. Our measure captures the contentfulness asymmetry between functional (grammatical) and lexical (content) classes across languages, but contradicts the view that functional classes do not convey content. Moreover, we find universal trends in the hierarchy of groundedness (e.g., nouns > adjectives > verbs), and show that our measure partly correlates with psycholinguistic concreteness norms in English. We release a dataset of groundedness scores for 30 languages. Our results suggest that the grounded typology approach can provide quantitative evidence about semantic function in language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masoud Bashiri, Kamran Kowsari</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools has revolutionized various facets of our lives, particularly in the realm of social media. For students, these advancements have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for learning, collaboration, and personal growth. AI-driven applications are transforming how students interact with social media, offering personalized content and recommendations, and enabling smarter, more efficient communication. Recent studies utilizing data from UniversityCube underscore the profound impact of AI tools on students' academic and social experiences. These studies reveal that students engaging with AI-enhanced social media platforms report higher academic performance, enhanced critical thinking skills, and increased engagement in collaborative projects.
  Moreover, AI tools assist in filtering out distracting content, allowing students to concentrate more on educational materials and pertinent discussions. The integration of LLMs in social media has further facilitated improved peer-to-peer communication and mentorship opportunities. AI algorithms effectively match students based on shared academic interests and career goals, fostering a supportive and intellectually stimulating online community, thereby contributing to increased student satisfaction and retention rates.
  In this article, we delve into the data provided by UniversityCube to explore how LLMs and AI tools are specifically transforming social media for students. Through case studies and statistical analyses, we offer a comprehensive understanding of the educational and social benefits these technologies offer. Our exploration highlights the potential of AI-driven tools to create a more enriched, efficient, and supportive educational environment for students in the digital age.</p>

<p>Abstract: [Study in German language.] This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhang, Shulin Tian, Ziqi Huang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of how large language models (LLMs) contribute to solving planning problems. In particular, we examine how LLMs perform when they are used as problem solver, solution verifier, and heuristic guidance to improve intermediate solutions. Our analysis reveals that although it is difficult for LLMs to generate correct plans out-of-the-box, LLMs are much better at providing feedback signals to intermediate/incomplete solutions in the form of comparative heuristic functions. This evaluation framework provides insights into how future work may design better LLM-based tree-search algorithms to solve diverse planning and reasoning problems. We also propose a novel benchmark to evaluate LLM's ability to learn user preferences on the fly, which has wide applications in practical settings.</p>

We show that the construction is functorial with respect to the category of finite state automata with transducers as morphisms. Certain classes of subregular languages correspond to additional cohomological structures on the associated TQFTs. We also show that the construction generalizes to context-free grammars through a categorical version of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem, due to Melli\`es and Zeilberger. The corresponding TQFTs are then described as morphisms of colored operads on an operad of cobordisms with defects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Moe{\ss}ner, Heike Adel</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of publicly available AI-based text-to-image systems, the process of creating photorealistic but fully synthetic images has been largely democratized. This can pose a threat to the public through a simplified spread of disinformation. Machine detectors and human media expertise can help to differentiate between AI-generated (fake) and real images and counteract this danger. Although AI generation models are highly prompt-dependent, the impact of the prompt on the fake detection performance has rarely been investigated yet. This work therefore examines the influence of the prompt's level of detail on the detectability of fake images, both with an AI detector and in a user study. For this purpose, we create a novel dataset, COCOXGEN, which consists of real photos from the COCO dataset as well as images generated with SDXL and Fooocus using prompts of two standardized lengths. Our user study with 200 participants shows that images generated with longer, more detailed prompts are detected significantly more easily than those generated with short prompts. Similarly, an AI-based detection model achieves better performance on images generated with longer prompts. However, humans and AI models seem to pay attention to different details, as we show in a heat map analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Zhang, Fanshuo Zeng, Yihao Quan, Zheng Hui, Jiawei Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models have experienced rapid growth, and numerous different models have emerged. The interpretability of LVLMs remains an under-explored area. Especially when faced with more complex tasks such as chain-of-thought reasoning, its internal mechanisms still resemble a black box that is difficult to decipher. By studying the interaction and information flow between images and text, we noticed that in models such as LLaVA1.5, image tokens that are semantically related to text are more likely to have information flow convergence in the LLM decoding layer, and these image tokens receive higher attention scores. However, those image tokens that are less relevant to the text do not have information flow convergence, and they only get very small attention scores. To efficiently utilize the image information, we propose a new image token reduction method, Simignore, which aims to improve the complex reasoning ability of LVLMs by computing the similarity between image and text embeddings and ignoring image tokens that are irrelevant and unimportant to the text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for complex reasoning tasks.

General-purpose language models are too general for sentiment analysis in finance.

We hypothesize that using actual and synthetic data can improve performance. We introduce BertNSP-finance to concatenate shorter financial sentences into longer financial sentences, and finbert-lc to determine sentiment from digital text.

<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms play a crucial role in decision making across diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and law enforcement. Despite their widespread adoption, these systems raise ethical and social concerns due to potential biases and fairness issues. This study focuses on evaluating and improving the fairness of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models applied to unstructured datasets, emphasizing how biased predictions can reinforce existing systemic inequalities. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle was utilized to simulate a practical scenario for examining fairness in ML workflows. To address and mitigate biases, the study employed two leading fairness libraries: Fairlearn by Microsoft, and AIF360 by IBM. These tools offer comprehensive frameworks for fairness analysis, including metrics evaluation, result visualization, and bias mitigation techniques. The research aims to measure bias levels in ML models, compare the effectiveness of these fairness libraries, and provide actionable recommendations for practitioners. The results demonstrate that each library possesses distinct strengths and limitations in evaluating and mitigating fairness. By systematically analyzing these tools, the study contributes valuable insights to the growing field of ML fairness, offering practical guidance for integrating fairness solutions into real world applications. This research underscores the importance of building more equitable and responsible machine learning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL, through two key major upgrades. For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models.

<p>Abstract: A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the select-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed to a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Zhu, Brandon Amos, Yuandong Tian, Chuan Guo, Ivan Evtimov</p>
<p>Abstract: Many jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) rely on a common objective: making the model respond with the prefix "Sure, here is (harmful request)". While straightforward, this objective has two limitations: limited control over model behaviors, often resulting in incomplete or unrealistic responses, and a rigid format that hinders optimization. To address these limitations, we introduce AdvPrefix, a new prefix-forcing objective that enables more nuanced control over model behavior while being easy to optimize. Our objective leverages model-dependent prefixes, automatically selected based on two criteria: high prefilling attack success rates and low negative log-likelihood. It can further simplify optimization by using multiple prefixes for a single user request. AdvPrefix can integrate seamlessly into existing jailbreak attacks to improve their performance for free. For example, simply replacing GCG attack's target prefixes with ours on Llama-3 improves nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, suggesting that current alignment struggles to generalize to unseen prefixes. Our work demonstrates the importance of jailbreak objectives in achieving nuanced jailbreaks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Tikhonov, Nikita Sorokin, Dmitry Abulkhanov, Irina Piontkovskaya, Sergey Nikolenko, Valentin Malykh</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the well-known and important tasks of clone detection and information retrieval for source code. The most standard setup is to search clones inside the same language code snippets. But it is also useful to find code snippets with identical behaviour in different programming languages. Nevertheless multi- and cross-lingual clone detection has been little studied in literature. We present a novel training procedure, cross-consistency training (CCT) leveraging cross-lingual similarity, that we apply to train language models on source code in various programming languages. We show that this training is effective both for encoder- and decoder-based models. The trained encoder-based CCT-LM model achieves a new state of the art on POJ-104 (monolingual C++ clone detection benchmark) with 96.73\% MAP and AdvTest (monolingual Python code search benchmark) with 47.18\% MRR. The decoder-based CCT-LM model shows comparable performance in these tasks. In addition, we formulate the multi- and cross-lingual clone detection problem and present XCD, a new benchmark dataset produced from CodeForces submissions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Sengupta, Connor Heaton, Suhan Cui, Soumalya Sarkar, Prasenjit Mitra</p>
<p>Abstract: In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is the task of answering a question based on a given context. To handle questions in the medical domain, modern language models such as BioBERT, SciBERT and even ChatGPT are trained on vast amounts of in-domain medical corpora. However, in-domain pre-training is expensive in terms of time and resources. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient approach for injecting domain knowledge into a model without relying on such domain-specific pre-training.
  Knowledge graphs are powerful resources for accessing medical information. Building on existing work, we introduce a method using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for aligning and integrating embeddings extracted from medical knowledge graphs with the embedding spaces of pre-trained language models (LMs). The aligned embeddings are fused with open-domain LMs BERT and RoBERTa that are fine-tuned for two MRC tasks, span detection (COVID-QA) and multiple-choice questions (PubMedQA). We compare our method to prior techniques that rely on a vocabulary overlap for embedding alignment and show how our method circumvents this requirement to deliver better performance. On both datasets, our method allows BERT/RoBERTa to either perform on par (occasionally exceeding) with stronger domain-specific models or show improvements in general over prior techniques. With the proposed approach, we signal an alternative method to in-domain pre-training to achieve domain proficiency. Our code is available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhui Pang, Fanghua Ye, Longyue Wang, Dian Yu, Derek F. Wong, Shuming Shi, Zhaopeng Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field. This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search. Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase. Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words. However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist. While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung Quoc Luong, Xinbo Zhang, Zhanming Jie, Peng Sun, Xiaoran Jin, Hang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: One way to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. This approach does not show sufficiently strong generalization ability, however, because the training only relies on the given CoT data. In math problem-solving, for example, there is usually only one annotated reasoning path for each question in the training data. Intuitively, it would be better for the algorithm to learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths given a question. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the generalizability of learning LLMs for reasoning, with math problem-solving as an example. ReFT first warmups the model with SFT, and then employs on-line reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm in this paper, to further fine-tune the model, where an abundance of reasoning paths are automatically sampled given the question and the rewards are naturally derived from the ground-truth answers. Extensive experiments on GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP datasets show that ReFT significantly outperforms SFT, and the performance can be potentially further boosted by combining inference-time strategies such as majority voting and re-ranking. Note that ReFT obtains the improvement by learning from the same training questions as SFT, without relying on extra or augmented training questions. This indicates a superior generalization ability for ReFT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Yunshi Lan, Chao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, numerous new benchmarks have been established to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) via either computing a holistic score or employing another LLM as a judge. However, these approaches suffer from data leakage due to the open access of the benchmark and inflexible evaluation process. To address this issue, we introduce $\textbf{TreeEval}$, a benchmark-free evaluation method for LLMs that let a high-performance LLM host an irreproducible evaluation session and essentially avoids the data leakage. Moreover, this LLM performs as an examiner to raise up a series of questions under a topic with a tree planing strategy, which considers the current evaluation status to decide the next question generation and ensures the completeness and efficiency of the evaluation process. We evaluate $6$ models of different parameter sizes, including $7$B, $13$B, and $33$B, and ultimately achieved the highest correlation coefficient with AlpacaEval2.0 using only around $45$ questions. We also conduct more analysis to show the robustness and reliability of TreeEval. Our code can be accessed via the provided https://github.com/Ashura5/TreeEval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengkai Huang, Yu Xia, Rui Wang, Kaige Xie, Tong Yu, Julian McAuley, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) have been remarkably competent in various NLP tasks. However, it was observed by previous works that retrieval is not always helpful, especially when the LLM is already knowledgeable on the query to answer. Motivated by this, Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ARAG) studies retrieving only when the knowledge asked by the query is absent in the LLM. Previous works of ARAG either require accessing the pre-training corpus or prompting with additional model inferences. Aiming to avoid such drawbacks, we propose to determine whether the model is knowledgeable on a query via inspecting the (contextualized) pre-trained token embeddings of LLMs. We hypothesize that such embeddings capture rich information on the model's intrinsic knowledge base, which enables an efficient way of judging the necessity to retrieve from an external corpus. Extensive experiments demonstrate our ARAG approach's superior performance across various benchmarks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03626">Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, Alex Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cuong Nhat Vo, Khanh Bao Huynh, Son T. Luu, Trong-Hop Do</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth of social networks makes toxic content spread rapidly. Hate speech detection is a task to help decrease the number of harmful comments. With the diversity in the hate speech created by users, it is necessary to interpret the hate speech besides detecting it. Hence, we propose a methodology to construct a system for targeted hate speech detection from online streaming texts from social media. We first introduce the ViTHSD - a targeted hate speech detection dataset for Vietnamese Social Media Texts. The dataset contains 10K comments, each comment is labeled to specific targets with three levels: clean, offensive, and hate. There are 5 targets in the dataset, and each target is labeled with the corresponding level manually by humans with strict annotation guidelines. The inter-annotator agreement obtained from the dataset is 0.45 by Cohen's Kappa index, which is indicated as a moderate level. Then, we construct a baseline for this task by combining the Bi-GRU-LSTM-CNN with the pre-trained language model to leverage the power of text representation of BERTology. Finally, we suggest a methodology to integrate the baseline model for targeted hate speech detection into the online streaming system for practical application in preventing hateful and offensive content on social media.</p>

However, the manual collection of role-specific script data and the evaluation of model performance are resource-intensive processes. This paper introduces a prompt-based framework designed to leverage GPT's capabilities for the generation of role-playing dialogue datasets and the evaluation of role-playing performance. To validate the effectiveness of the GPT-based generation and evaluation, we further incorporate the recall-oriented Rouge-L metric, providing an additional quantitative measure of performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taiming Lu, Philipp Koehn</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the propagation of harmful information in multilingual large language models (LLMs) and evaluates the efficacy of various unlearning methods. We demonstrate that fake information, regardless of the language it is in, once introduced into these models through training data, can spread across different languages, compromising the integrity and reliability of the generated content. Our findings reveal that standard unlearning techniques, which typically focus on English data, are insufficient in mitigating the spread of harmful content in multilingual contexts and could inadvertently reinforce harmful content across languages. We show that only by addressing harmful responses in both English and the original language of the harmful data can we effectively eliminate generations for all languages. This underscores the critical need for comprehensive unlearning strategies that consider the multilingual nature of modern LLMs to enhance their safety and reliability across diverse linguistic landscapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Zhang, Long Jin, Yushan Zhu, Jiaoyan Chen, Zhiwei Huang, Junjie Wang, Yin Hua, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language question answering (QA) over structured data sources such as tables and knowledge graphs have been widely investigated, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years. The main solutions include question to formal query parsing and retrieval-based answer generation. However, current methods of the former often suffer from weak generalization, failing to dealing with multi-types of sources, while the later is limited in trustfulness. In this paper, we propose TrustUQA, a trustful QA framework that can simultaneously support multiple types of structured data in a unified way. To this end, it adopts an LLM-friendly and unified knowledge representation method called Condition Graph(CG), and uses an LLM and demonstration-based two-level method for CG querying. For enhancement, it is also equipped with dynamic demonstration retrieval. We have evaluated TrustUQA with 5 benchmarks covering 3 types of structured data. It outperforms 2 existing unified structured data QA methods. In comparison with the baselines that are specific to one data type, it achieves state-of-the-art on 2 of the datasets. Further more, we have demonstrated the potential of our method for more general QA tasks, QA over mixed structured data and QA across structured data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tamzeed Mahfuz, Satak Kumar Dey, Ruwad Naswan, Hasnaen Adil, Khondker Salman Sayeed, Haz Sameen Shahgir</p>
<p>Abstract: Each new generation of English-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibits enhanced cross-lingual transfer capabilities and significantly outperforms older LLMs on low-resource languages. This prompts the question: Is there a need for LLMs dedicated to a particular low-resource language? We aim to explore this question for Bengali, a low-to-moderate resource Indo-Aryan language native to the Bengal region of South Asia.
  We compare the performance of open-weight and closed-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3 and GPT-4 against fine-tuned encoder-decoder models across a diverse set of Bengali downstream tasks, including translation, summarization, paraphrasing, question-answering, and natural language inference. Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally excel in reasoning tasks, their performance in tasks requiring Bengali script generation is inconsistent. Key challenges include inefficient tokenization of Bengali script by existing LLMs, leading to increased computational costs and potential performance degradation. Additionally, we highlight biases in machine-translated datasets commonly used for Bengali NLP tasks. We conclude that there is a significant need for a Bengali-oriented LLM, but the field currently lacks the high-quality pretraining and instruction-tuning datasets necessary to develop a highly effective model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has put forward the study of biases as a crucial field. It is important to assess the influence of different types of biases embedded in LLMs to ensure fair use in sensitive fields. Although there have been extensive works on bias assessment in English, such efforts are rare and scarce for a major language like Bangla. In this work, we examine two types of social biases in LLM generated outputs for Bangla language. Our main contributions in this work are: (1) bias studies on two different social biases for Bangla, (2) a curated dataset for bias measurement benchmarking and (3) testing two different probing techniques for bias detection in the context of Bangla. This is the first work of such kind involving bias assessment of LLMs for Bangla to the best of our knowledge. All our code and resources are publicly available for the progress of bias related research in Bangla NLP.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform, interpret, and comprehend vast quantities of heterogeneous data presents a significant opportunity to enhance data-driven care delivery. However, the sensitive nature of protected health information (PHI) raises valid concerns about data privacy and trust in remote LLM platforms. In addition, the cost associated with cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services continues to impede widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a shift in the LLM execution environment from opaque, centralized cloud providers to a decentralized and dynamic fog computing architecture. By executing open-weight LLMs in more trusted environments, such as the user's edge device or a fog layer within a local network, we aim to mitigate the privacy, trust, and financial challenges associated with cloud-based LLMs. We further present SpeziLLM, an open-source framework designed to facilitate rapid and seamless leveraging of different LLM execution layers and lowering barriers to LLM integration in digital health applications. We demonstrate SpeziLLM's broad applicability across six digital health applications, showcasing its versatility in various healthcare settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts exhibit recognition errors and various spoken language phenomena such as disfluencies, ungrammatical sentences, and incomplete sentences, hence suffering from poor readability. To improve readability, we propose a Contextualized Spoken-to-Written conversion (CoS2W) task to address ASR and grammar errors and also transfer the informal text into the formal style with content preserved, utilizing contexts and auxiliary information. This task naturally matches the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate comprehensive comparisons of various LLMs, we construct a document-level Spoken-to-Written conversion of ASR Transcripts Benchmark (SWAB) dataset. Using SWAB, we study the impact of different granularity levels on the CoS2W performance, and propose methods to exploit contexts and auxiliary information to enhance the outputs. Experimental results reveal that LLMs have the potential to excel in the CoS2W task, particularly in grammaticality and formality, our methods achieve effective understanding of contexts and auxiliary information by LLMs. We further investigate the effectiveness of using LLMs as evaluators and find that LLM evaluators show strong correlations with human evaluations on rankings of faithfulness and formality, which validates the reliability of LLM evaluators for the CoS2W task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingkang Yang, Dongling Xiao, Jinjie Wei, Mingcheng Li, Zhaoyu Chen, Ke Li, Lihua Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generate responses that contradict verifiable facts, i.e., unfaithful hallucination content. Existing efforts generally focus on optimizing model parameters or editing semantic representations, which compromise the internal factual knowledge of target LLMs. In addition, hallucinations typically exhibit multifaceted patterns in downstream tasks, limiting the model's holistic performance across tasks. In this paper, we propose a Comparator-driven Decoding-Time (CDT) framework to alleviate the response hallucination. Firstly, we construct hallucinatory and truthful comparators with multi-task fine-tuning samples. In this case, we present an instruction prototype-guided mixture of experts strategy to enhance the ability of the corresponding comparators to capture different hallucination or truthfulness patterns in distinct task instructions. CDT constrains next-token predictions to factuality-robust distributions by contrasting the logit differences between the target LLMs and these comparators. Systematic experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that our framework can significantly improve the model performance and response factuality.</p>

We also explore the capability of several popular open-access large language model systems and open-source models at comprehending and playing the game in two different languages. Results highlight the struggles of certain models to maintain correct guess length and generate repetitions, as well as hallucinations of non-existent words and inflections.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel analysis that leverages linguistic minimal pairs to probe the internal linguistic representations of Large Language Models (LLMs). By measuring the similarity between LLM activation differences across minimal pairs, we quantify the and gain insight into the linguistic knowledge captured by LLMs. Our large-scale experiments, spanning 100+ LLMs and 150k minimal pairs in three languages, reveal properties of linguistic similarity from four key aspects: consistency across LLMs, relation to theoretical categorizations, dependency to semantic context, and cross-lingual alignment of relevant phenomena. Our findings suggest that 1) linguistic similarity is significantly influenced by training data exposure, leading to higher cross-LLM agreement in higher-resource languages. 2) Linguistic similarity strongly aligns with fine-grained theoretical linguistic categories but weakly with broader ones. 3) Linguistic similarity shows a weak correlation with semantic similarity, showing its context-dependent nature. 4) LLMs exhibit limited cross-lingual alignment in their understanding of relevant linguistic phenomena. This work demonstrates the potential of minimal pairs as a window into the neural representations of language in LLMs, shedding light on the relationship between LLMs and linguistic theory.

In this investigation, we compare the performance of SFT and DPO for five common natural language tasks in medicine: Classification with text data, Classification with numeric data, Clinical Reasoning, Summarization, and Clinical Triage. We find that SFT alone is sufficient for Classification with text data, whereas DPO improves performance for the more complex tasks of Clinical Reasoning, Summarization and Clinical Triage. Our results establish the role and importance of DPO fine tuning within medicine, and consequently call attention to current software gaps that prevent widespread deployment of this technique.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyeongman Park, Minbeom Kim, Kyomin Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: Creative story generation has long been a goal of NLP research. While existing methodologies have aimed to generate long and coherent stories, they fall significantly short of human capabilities in terms of diversity and character depth. To address this, we introduce a novel story generation framework called CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via Imagination). CCI features two modules for creative story generation: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) and MW (Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we utilize a text-to-image model to create visual representations of key story elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and main plots, in a more novel and concrete manner than text-only approaches. The MW module uses these story elements to generate multiple persona-description candidates and selects the best one to insert into the story, thereby enhancing the richness and depth of the narrative. We compared the stories generated by CCI and baseline models through statistical analysis, as well as human and LLM evaluations. The results showed that the IG and MW modules significantly improve various aspects of the stories' creativity. Furthermore, our framework enables interactive multi-modal story generation with users, opening up new possibilities for human-LLM integration in cultural development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Gramacki, Bruno Martins, Piotr Szyma\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Software development support tools have been studied for a long time, with recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. These models can generate Python code for data science and machine learning applications. LLMs are helpful for software engineers because they increase productivity in daily work. An LLM can also serve as a "mentor" for inexperienced software developers, and be a viable learning support. High-quality code generation with LLMs can also be beneficial in geospatial data science. However, this domain poses different challenges, and code generation LLMs are typically not evaluated on geospatial tasks. Here, we show how we constructed an evaluation benchmark for code generation models, based on a selection of geospatial tasks. We categorised geospatial tasks based on their complexity and required tools. Then, we created a dataset with tasks that test model capabilities in spatial reasoning, spatial data processing, and geospatial tools usage. The dataset consists of specific coding problems that were manually created for high quality. For every problem, we proposed a set of test scenarios that make it possible to automatically check the generated code for correctness. In addition, we tested a selection of existing code generation LLMs for code generation in the geospatial domain. We share our dataset and reproducible evaluation code on a public GitHub repository, arguing that this can serve as an evaluation benchmark for new LLMs in the future. Our dataset will hopefully contribute to the development new models capable of solving geospatial coding tasks with high accuracy. These models will enable the creation of coding assistants tailored for geospatial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nedjma Ousidhoum, Meriem Beloucif, Saif M. Mohammad</p>
<p>Abstract: Language is a symbolic capital that affects people's lives in many ways (Bourdieu, 1977, 1991). It is a powerful tool that accounts for identities, cultures, traditions, and societies in general. Hence, data in a given language should be viewed as more than a collection of tokens. Good data collection and labeling practices are key to building more human-centered and socially aware technologies. While there has been a rising interest in mid- to low-resource languages within the NLP community, work in this space has to overcome unique challenges such as data scarcity and access to suitable annotators. In this paper, we collect feedback from those directly involved in and impacted by NLP artefacts for mid- to low-resource languages. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the responses and highlight the main issues related to (1) data quality such as linguistic and cultural data suitability; and (2) the ethics of common annotation practices such as the misuse of online community services. Based on these findings, we make several recommendations for the creation of high-quality language artefacts that reflect the cultural milieu of its speakers, while simultaneously respecting the dignity and labor of data workers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuzheng Si, Haozhe Zhao, Gang Chen, Yunshui Li, Kangyang Luo, Chuancheng Lv, Kaikai An, Fanchao Qi, Baobao Chang, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models to handle instructions with extremely long contexts has yet to be fully investigated. Previous studies attempt to scale up the available data volume by synthesizing long instruction-following samples, as constructing such a dataset tends to be challenging for annotators. However, a lack of a well-defined strategy for ensuring data quality may introduce low-quality samples and restrict the model performance. Thus, we propose GATEAU, a novel framework to address the unique challenge of long context alignment by identifying the influential samples enriched with long-range dependency relations. Specifically, GATEAU measures the long-range dependencies from two essential aspects: the difficulty of generating target responses due to the long-range dependencies, and the difficulty of understanding long inputs due to such dependencies. Comprehensive experiments indicate that GATEAU effectively identifies influential samples and the model trained on these selected samples exhibits better instruction-following and long-context understanding capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao, Kevin Tang, Dinah Baer-Henney</p>
<p>Abstract: The present paper evaluates the learning behaviour of a transformer-based neural network with regard to an irregular inflectional paradigm. We apply the paradigm cell filling problem to irregular patterns. We approach this problem using the morphological reinflection task and model it as a character sequence-to-sequence learning problem. The test case under investigation are irregular verbs in Spanish. Besides many regular verbs in Spanish L-shaped verbs the first person singular indicative stem irregularly matches the subjunctive paradigm, while other indicative forms remain unaltered. We examine the role of frequency during learning and compare models under differing input frequency conditions. We train the model on a corpus of Spanish with a realistic distribution of regular and irregular verbs to compare it with models trained on input with augmented distributions of (ir)regular words. We explore how the neural models learn this L-shaped pattern using post-hoc analyses. Our experiments show that, across frequency conditions, the models are surprisingly capable of learning the irregular pattern. Furthermore, our post-hoc analyses reveal the possible sources of errors. All code and data are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/modeling_spanish_acl-7567/} under MIT license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shan Zhong, Jiahao Zeng, Yongxin Yu, Bohong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for text classification tasks, effectively addressing the challenge of vast datasets with limited labeled examples. By integrating multi-level similarity based data augmentation techniques from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to Large Language Model (LLM) rewriting and traditional word substitution-we constructed an intelligent augmentation pipeline. This framework innovatively employs the selection of representative landmarks through clustering, which serve as intermediaries in the retrieval and rewriting processes, ensuring that the augmented data maintains a distribution similar to the original dataset. Empirical results show that even in complex text document classification scenarios with over 100 categories, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 95.41% and 82.43% on the Reuters and Web of Science datasets, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our semi-supervised learning approach for text classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wang, Aman Rangapur, Xiongxiao Xu, Yueqing Liang, Haroon Gharwi, Carl Yang, Kai Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing claim verification datasets often do not require systems to perform complex reasoning or effectively interpret multimodal evidence. To address this, we introduce a new task: multi-hop multimodal claim verification. This task challenges models to reason over multiple pieces of evidence from diverse sources, including text, images, and tables, and determine whether the combined multimodal evidence supports or refutes a given claim. To study this task, we construct MMCV, a large-scale dataset comprising 15k multi-hop claims paired with multimodal evidence, generated and refined using large language models, with additional input from human feedback. We show that MMCV is challenging even for the latest state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, especially as the number of reasoning hops increases. Additionally, we establish a human performance benchmark on a subset of MMCV. We hope this dataset and its evaluation task will encourage future research in multimodal multi-hop claim verification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Narayan Sankaran, Reza Farahbakhsh, Noel Crespi</p>
<p>Abstract: Online abusive content detection, particularly in low-resource settings and within the audio modality, remains underexplored. We investigate the potential of pre-trained audio representations for detecting abusive language in low-resource languages, in this case, in Indian languages using Few Shot Learning (FSL). Leveraging powerful representations from models such as Wav2Vec and Whisper, we explore cross-lingual abuse detection using the ADIMA dataset with FSL. Our approach integrates these representations within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework to classify abusive language in 10 languages. We experiment with various shot sizes (50-200) evaluating the impact of limited data on performance. Additionally, a feature visualization study was conducted to better understand model behaviour. This study highlights the generalization ability of pre-trained models in low-resource scenarios and offers valuable insights into detecting abusive language in multilingual contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Kouwenhoven, Max Peeperkorn, Tessa Verhoef</p>
<p>Abstract: Human languages have evolved to be structured through repeated language learning and use. These processes introduce biases that operate during language acquisition and shape linguistic systems toward communicative efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether the same happens if artificial languages are optimised for implicit biases of Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we simulate a classical referential game in which LLMs learn and use artificial languages. Our results show that initially unstructured holistic languages are indeed shaped to have some structural properties that allow two LLM agents to communicate successfully. Similar to observations in human experiments, generational transmission increases the learnability of languages, but can at the same time result in non-humanlike degenerate vocabularies. Taken together, this work extends experimental findings, shows that LLMs can be used as tools in simulations of language evolution, and opens possibilities for future human-machine experiments in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihan Tan, Taro Miyazaki, Nabeela Khan, Kazuhiro Nakadai</p>
<p>Abstract: Current sign language translation (SLT) approaches often rely on gloss-based supervision with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), limiting their ability to handle non-monotonic alignments between sign language video and spoken text. In this work, we propose a novel method combining joint CTC/Attention and transfer learning. The joint CTC/Attention introduces hierarchical encoding and integrates CTC with the attention mechanism during decoding, effectively managing both monotonic and non-monotonic alignments. Meanwhile, transfer learning helps bridge the modality gap between vision and language in SLT. Experimental results on two widely adopted benchmarks, RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 T and CSL-Daily, show that our method achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art and outperforms the pure-attention baseline. Additionally, this work opens a new door for future research into gloss-free SLT using text-based CTC alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourav Banerjee, Anush Mahajan, Ayushi Agarwal, Eishkaran Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks require identifying the relationship between sentence pairs, typically classified as entailment, contradiction, or neutrality. While the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, Entailment Few-Shot Learning (EFL), achieves a 93.1% accuracy on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, further advancements are constrained by the dataset's limitations. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging synthetic data augmentation to enhance dataset diversity and complexity. We present UnitedSynT5, an advanced extension of EFL that leverages a T5-based generator to synthesize additional premise-hypothesis pairs, which are rigorously cleaned and integrated into the training data. These augmented examples are processed within the EFL framework, embedding labels directly into hypotheses for consistency. We train a GTR-T5-XL model on this expanded dataset, achieving a new benchmark of 94.7% accuracy on the SNLI dataset, 94.0% accuracy on the E-SNLI dataset, and 92.6% accuracy on the MultiNLI dataset, surpassing the previous SOTA models. This research demonstrates the potential of synthetic data augmentation in improving NLI models, offering a path forward for further advancements in natural language understanding tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs can generate human-like dialogues, yet their ability to simulate early child-adult interactions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans. The broader goal of this work is to initiate the development of a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs in child-oriented applications.</p>

Additionally, developing NLP tools for Luxembourgish is a difficult task given the lack of annotated and parallel data, which is exacerbated by ongoing standardization. In this paper, we propose the first sequence-to-sequence normalization models using the ByT5 and mT5 architectures with training data obtained from word-level real-life variation data. We perform a fine-grained, linguistically-motivated evaluation to test byte-based, word-based and pipeline-based models for their strengths and weaknesses in text normalization. We show that our sequence model using real-life variation data is an effective approach for tailor-made normalization in Luxembourgish.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeongjae Cho, Taehee Kim, Heejun Shin, Sungzoon Cho, Dongmyung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Difference visual question answering (diff-VQA) is a challenging task that requires answering complex questions based on differences between a pair of images. This task is particularly important in reading chest X-ray images because radiologists often compare multiple images of the same patient taken at different times to track disease progression and changes in its severity in their clinical practice. However, previous works focused on designing specific network architectures for the diff-VQA task, missing opportunities to enhance the model's performance using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Here, we introduce a novel VLM called PLURAL, which is pretrained on natural and longitudinal chest X-ray data for the diff-VQA task. The model is developed using a step-by-step approach, starting with being pretrained on natural images and texts, followed by being trained using longitudinal chest X-ray data. The longitudinal data consist of pairs of X-ray images, along with question-answer sets and radiologist's reports that describe the changes in lung abnormalities and diseases over time. Our experimental results show that the PLURAL model outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only in diff-VQA for longitudinal X-rays but also in conventional VQA for a single X-ray image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VLM architecture and pretraining method in improving the model's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Mohamed Abdalla, Bela Gipp, Saif M. Mohammad</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines the tendency to cite older work across 20 fields of study over 43 years (1980--2023). We put NLP's propensity to cite older work in the context of these 20 other fields to analyze whether NLP shows similar temporal citation patterns to these other fields over time or whether differences can be observed. Our analysis, based on a dataset of approximately 240 million papers, reveals a broader scientific trend: many fields have markedly declined in citing older works (e.g., psychology, computer science). We term this decline a 'citation age recession', analogous to how economists define periods of reduced economic activity. The trend is strongest in NLP and ML research (-12.8% and -5.5% in citation age from previous peaks). Our results suggest that citing more recent works is not directly driven by the growth in publication rates (-3.4% across fields; -5.2% in humanities; -5.5% in formal sciences) -- even when controlling for an increase in the volume of papers. Our findings raise questions about the scientific community's engagement with past literature, particularly for NLP, and the potential consequences of neglecting older but relevant research. The data and a demo showcasing our results are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Yang, Renzhi Chen, Ke Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The alignment between RNA sequences and structures in foundation models (FMs) has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Existing FMs have struggled to establish sequence-structure alignment, hindering the free flow of genomic information between RNA sequences and structures. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, an RNA FM trained to align RNA sequences with respect to secondary structures based on structure-contextualised modelling. The alignment enables free and bidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the flexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output modalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate the Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2 benchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only solved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure alignment. We leverage four comprehensive in-silico genome modelling benchmarks to evaluate performance across a diverse set of genome downstream tasks, where the results show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on RNA and DNA benchmarks, even without any training on DNA genomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvind Krishna Sridhar, Yinyi Guo, Erik Visser</p>
<p>Abstract: The Audio Question Answering (AQA) task includes audio event classification, audio captioning, and open-ended reasoning. Recently, AQA has garnered attention due to the advent of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). Current literature focuses on constructing LALMs by integrating audio encoders with text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) through a projection module. While LALMs excel in general audio understanding, they are limited in temporal reasoning, which may hinder their commercial applications and on-device deployment. This paper addresses these challenges and limitations in audio temporal reasoning. First, we introduce a data augmentation technique for generating reliable audio temporal questions and answers using an LLM. Second, we perform a further fine-tuning of an existing baseline using curriculum learning strategy to specialize in temporal reasoning without compromising performance on fine-tuned tasks. We demonstrate the performance of our model using state-of-the-art LALMs on public audio benchmark datasets. Third, we implement our AQA model on-device locally and investigate its CPU inference for edge applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangqi Duan, Nigel Fernandez, Alexander Hicks, Andrew Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended coding tasks, which ask students to construct programs according to certain specifications, are common in computer science education. Student modeling can be challenging since their open-ended nature means that student code can be diverse. Traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models that only analyze response correctness may not fully capture nuances in student knowledge from student code. In this paper, we introduce Test case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding (TIKTOC), a framework to simultaneously analyze and predict both open-ended student code and whether the code passes each test case. We augment the existing CodeWorkout dataset with the test cases used for a subset of the open-ended coding questions, and propose a multi-task learning KT method to simultaneously analyze and predict 1) whether a student's code submission passes each test case and 2) the student's open-ended code, using a large language model as the backbone. We quantitatively show that these methods outperform existing KT methods for coding that only use the overall score a code submission receives. We also qualitatively demonstrate how test case information, combined with open-ended code, helps us gain fine-grained insights into student knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.
  Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.</p>

This study provided evidence that NLP can be used to improve the mapping process. As part of this investigation, the nominal classifications of standards and items specifications were used to examine construct equivalence. In the current paper, we determine the strength of empirical support for the semantic distinctiveness of these classifications, which are known as "domains" for Common Core standards, and "strands" for National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) item specifications. This is accomplished by separate k-means clustering for standards and specifications of their corresponding embedding vectors. We then briefly illustrate an application of these findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for automatically generating data-cleaning workflows. To evaluate LLMs' ability to complete data-cleaning tasks, we implemented a pipeline for LLM-based Auto Data Cleaning Workflow (AutoDCWorkflow), prompting LLMs on data cleaning operations to repair three types of data quality issues: duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data formats. Given a dirty table and a purpose (expressed as a query), this pipeline generates a minimal, clean table sufficient to address the purpose and the data cleaning workflow used to produce the table. The planning process involves three main LLM-driven components: (1) Select Target Columns: Identifies a set of target columns related to the purpose. (2) Inspect Column Quality: Assesses the data quality for each target column and generates a Data Quality Report as operation objectives. (3) Generate Operation & Arguments: Predicts the next operation and arguments based on the data quality report results. Additionally, we propose a data cleaning benchmark to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to automatically generate workflows that address data cleaning purposes of varying difficulty levels. The benchmark comprises the annotated datasets as a collection of purpose, raw table, clean table, data cleaning workflow, and answer set. In our experiments, we evaluated three LLMs that auto-generate purpose-driven data cleaning workflows. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in planning and generating data-cleaning workflows without the need for fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Li, Ruoyuan Gong, Hao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting roll call votes through modeling political actors has emerged as a focus in quantitative political science and computer science. Widely used embedding-based methods generate vectors for legislators from diverse data sets to predict legislative behaviors. However, these methods often contend with challenges such as the need for manually predefined features, reliance on extensive training data, and a lack of interpretability. Achieving more interpretable predictions under flexible conditions remains an unresolved issue. This paper introduces the Political Actor Agent (PAA), a novel agent-based framework that utilizes Large Language Models to overcome these limitations. By employing role-playing architectures and simulating legislative system, PAA provides a scalable and interpretable paradigm for predicting roll-call votes. Our approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also offers multi-view, human-understandable decision reasoning, providing new insights into political actor behaviors. We conducted comprehensive experiments using voting records from the 117-118th U.S. House of Representatives, validating the superior performance and interpretability of PAA. This study not only demonstrates PAA's effectiveness but also its potential in political science research.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08038">Bootstrapping Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning via Large Language Models: A Generalized Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Gao, Chenhao Zhang, Fengge Wu, Junsuo Zhao, Changwen Zheng, Huaping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanze Lin, Yunsheng Li, Dongdong Chen, Weijian Xu, Ronald Clark, Philip H. S. Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Olympus, a new approach that transforms Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into a unified framework capable of handling a wide array of computer vision tasks. Utilizing a controller MLLM, Olympus delegates over 20 specialized tasks across images, videos, and 3D objects to dedicated modules. This instruction-based routing enables complex workflows through chained actions without the need for training heavy generative models. Olympus easily integrates with existing MLLMs, expanding their capabilities with comparable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Olympus achieves an average routing accuracy of 94.75% across 20 tasks and precision of 91.82% in chained action scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness as a universal task router that can solve a diverse range of computer vision tasks.
