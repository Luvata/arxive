<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinwoo Park, Yo-Sub Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Distinguishing human-written Korean text from fluent LLM outputs remains difficult even for linguistically trained readers, who can over-trust surface well-formedness. We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors. Our findings suggest that rubric-scaffolded expert judgment can serve as an interpretable complement to automated detectors for non-English settings, and we release the full rubric and a taxonomy of calibrated detection signatures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxwell Crouse, Ibrahim Abdelaziz, Kshitij Fadnis, Siva Sankalp Patel, Kinjal Basu, Chulaka Gunasekara, Sadhana Kumaravel, Asim Munawar, Pavan Kapanipathi</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic data has proven itself to be a valuable resource for tuning smaller, cost-effective language models to handle the complexities of multi-turn tool calling conversations. While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request. We validate our approach on standard tool calling benchmarks and demonstrate that, even in stateful problem settings, our approach results in strong performance gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Tarau</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Arrow Language Model}, a neural architecture derived from an intuitionistic-logic interpretation of next-token prediction. Instead of representing tokens as additive embeddings mixed by attention, we encode a prefix as a \emph{left-nested implication chain} whose structure preserves order through non-commutative composition. Next-token prediction corresponds to \emph{modus ponens}, and sequence processing becomes constructive proof extension under the Curry--Howard correspondence. Our Prolog-based specialized theorem provers validate fundamental properties of the neural models, among which relations between commutative vs. non-commutative sequencing and single-token vs. multi-token prediction choices. We show that a neural architecture equivalent to multiplicative RNNs arises naturally from a proof-theoretic interpretation of next-token prediction as nested intuitionistic implication, we present a practical low-rank neural realization and position the model relative to Transformers and state-space models.
  Keywords: logic-based derivation of neural architectures, intuitionistic implicational logic, token-as-operator neural models, state-space models, alternatives to transformer-based foundational models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songjun Tu, Yiwen Ma, Jiahao Lin, Qichao Zhang, Xiangyuan Lan, Junfeng. Li, Nan Xu, Linjing Li, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models can generate fluent peer reviews, yet their assessments often lack sufficient critical rigor when substantive issues are subtle and distributed across a paper. In this paper, we introduce PaperAudit-Bench, which consists of two components: (1) PaperAudit-Dataset, an error dataset covering both errors identifiable within individual sections and those requiring cross-section reasoning, designed for controlled evaluation under long-context settings; and (2) PaperAudit-Review, an automated review framework that integrates structured error detection with evidence-aware review generation to support critical assessment. Experiments on PaperAudit-Bench reveal large variability in error detectability across models and detection depths, highlighting the difficulty of identifying such errors under long-context settings. Relative to representative automated reviewing baselines, incorporating explicit error detection into the review workflow produces systematically stricter and more discriminative evaluations, demonstrating its suitability for peer review. Finally, we show that the dataset supports training lightweight LLM detectors via SFT and RL, enabling effective error detection at reduced computational cost.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19917">PILOT: Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zheng, Yun Zhu, Yuqian Yuan, Bo Yuan, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Jun Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Strategic planning is critical for multi-step reasoning, yet compact Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the capacity to formulate global strategies, leading to error propagation in long-horizon tasks. Our analysis reveals that LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked when conditioned on explicit plans from a teacher model; however, runtime reliance on external guidance is often impractical due to latency and availability constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose PILOT (Planning via Internalized Latent Optimization Trajectories), a non-invasive framework designed to internalize the strategic oversight of large models into intrinsic Latent Guidance. Instead of altering backbone weights, PILOT employs a lightweight Hyper-Network to synthesize a query-conditioned Latent Guidance vector. This vector acts as an internal steering mechanism, guiding the model's representations toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on mathematical and coding benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT effectively stabilizes reasoning trajectories, consistently outperforming strong baselines (e.g., +8.9% on MATH500) with negligible inference latency.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19918">Lowest Span Confidence: A Zero-Shot Metric for Efficient and Black-Box Hallucination Detection in LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitong Qiao, Licheng Pan, Yu Mi, Lei Liu, Yue Shen, Fei Sun, Zhixuan Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., the tendency to generate plausible but non-factual content, pose a significant challenge for their reliable deployment in high-stakes environments. However, existing hallucination detection methods generally operate under unrealistic assumptions, i.e., either requiring expensive intensive sampling strategies for consistency checks or white-box LLM states, which are unavailable or inefficient in common API-based scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient zero-shot metric called Lowest Span Confidence (LSC) for hallucination detection under minimal resource assumptions, only requiring a single forward with output probabilities. Concretely, LSC evaluates the joint likelihood of semantically coherent spans via a sliding window mechanism. By identifying regions of lowest marginal confidence across variable-length n-grams, LSC could well capture local uncertainty patterns strongly correlated with factual inconsistency. Importantly, LSC can mitigate the dilution effect of perplexity and the noise sensitivity of minimum token probability, offering a more robust estimate of factual uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and diverse benchmarks show that LSC consistently outperforms existing zero-shot baselines, delivering strong detection performance even under resource-constrained conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junseok Lee, Nahoon Kim, Sangyong Lee, Chang-Jae Chun</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation is one of the most effective methods for model compression. Previous studies have focused on the student model effectively training the predictive distribution of the teacher model. However, during training, the student model may inherit the shortcomings of the teacher model, which can lead to a decline in generalization capacity. To mitigate this issue, we propose adaptive self-knowledge distillation (ASKD), which dynamically reduces the dependence of the teacher model to improve the self-training capacity, and performs the self-knowledge distillation method to improve the generalization capacity of the student model. We further distill the Whisper model into a smaller variant, called FastWhisper. In our post-training setting, FastWhisper achieved a word error rate of 1.07% lower than the teacher model Whisper, and its relative inference time was 5 times faster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochen Zhu, Caiqi Zhang, Yizhou Chi, Tom Stafford, Nigel Collier, Andreas Vlachos</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is widely used to improve large language model (LLM) performance through test-time scaling, yet recent work shows that vanilla MAD often underperforms simple majority vote despite higher computational cost. Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence. We show theoretically that diversity-aware initialisation improves the prior probability of MAD success without changing the underlying update dynamics, while confidence-modulated updates enable debate to systematically drift to the correct hypothesis. Empirically, across six reasoning-oriented QA benchmarks, our methods consistently outperform vanilla MAD and majority vote. Our results connect human deliberation with LLM-based debate and demonstrate that simple, principled modifications can substantially enhance debate effectiveness.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19922">HEART: A Unified Benchmark for Assessing Humans and LLMs in Emotional Support Dialogue</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Laya Iyer, Kriti Aggarwal, Sanmi Koyejo, Gail Heyman, Desmond C. Ong, Subhabrata Mukherjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Supportive conversation depends on skills that go beyond language fluency, including reading emotions, adjusting tone, and navigating moments of resistance, frustration, or distress. Despite rapid progress in language models, we still lack a clear way to understand how their abilities in these interpersonal domains compare to those of humans. We introduce HEART, the first-ever framework that directly compares humans and LLMs on the same multi-turn emotional-support conversations. For each dialogue history, we pair human and model responses and evaluate them through blinded human raters and an ensemble of LLM-as-judge evaluators. All assessments follow a rubric grounded in interpersonal communication science across five dimensions: Human Alignment, Empathic Responsiveness, Attunement, Resonance, and Task-Following. HEART uncovers striking behavioral patterns. Several frontier models approach or surpass the average human responses in perceived empathy and consistency. At the same time, humans maintain advantages in adaptive reframing, tension-naming, and nuanced tone shifts, particularly in adversarial turns. Human and LLM-as-judge preferences align on about 80 percent of pairwise comparisons, matching inter-human agreement, and their written rationales emphasize similar HEART dimensions. This pattern suggests an emerging convergence in the criteria used to assess supportive quality. By placing humans and models on equal footing, HEART reframes supportive dialogue as a distinct capability axis, separable from general reasoning or linguistic fluency. It provides a unified empirical foundation for understanding where model-generated support aligns with human social judgment, where it diverges, and how affective conversational competence scales with model size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxiang Zhao, Qince Li, Zhonghao Wang, Zelin Cao, Yi Wang, Peng Cheng, Bo Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents, the capability to faithfully translate natural language into rigorous structured formats-essential for tool invocation-and to convert complex tabular information into machine-readable specifications has become paramount. However, current evaluations lack effective methodologies to measure this structural fidelity without costly human intervention, as traditional text metrics fail to detect semantic drift in code-like outputs. This paper proposes Table-BiEval, a novel approach based on a human-free, self-supervised evaluation framework, to assess LLMs performance quantitatively. By leveraging deterministic Intermediate Representations, our framework calculates Content Semantic Accuracy and Normalized Tree Edit Distance to decouple structure from content. Also, it empirically evaluates 15 state-of-the-art LLMs across dual topological dimensions-hierarchical structures and flat tables. The results reveal substantial variability, highlighting that mid-sized models can surprisingly outperform larger counterparts in structural efficiency and confirming that deep recursive nesting remains a universal bottleneck for current architectures.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19924">OPT-Engine: Benchmarking the Limits of LLMs in Optimization Modeling via Complexity Scaling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitian Chen, Cheng Cheng, Yinan Sun, Zi Ling, Dongdong Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive progress in optimization modeling, fostering a rapid expansion of new methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. However, the boundaries of their capabilities in automated formulation and problem solving remain poorly understood, particularly when extending to complex, real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose OPT-ENGINE, an extensible benchmark framework designed to evaluate LLMs on optimization modeling with controllable and scalable difficulty levels. OPT-ENGINE spans 10 canonical tasks across operations research, with five Linear Programming and five Mixed-Integer Programming. Utilizing OPT-ENGINE, we conduct an extensive study of LLMs' reasoning capabilities, addressing two critical questions: 1.) Do LLMs' performance remain robust when generalizing to out-of-distribution optimization tasks that scale in complexity beyond current benchmark levels? and 2.) At what stage, from problem interpretation to solution generation, do current LLMs encounter the most significant bottlenecks? Our empirical results yield two key insights: first, tool-integrated reasoning with external solvers exhibits significantly higher robustness as task complexity escalates, while pure-text reasoning reaches a ceiling; second, the automated formulation of constraints constitutes the primary performance bottleneck. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing next-generation LLMs for advanced optimization.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19925">Evaluating Large Language Models for Abstract Evaluation Tasks: An Empirical Study</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinuo Liu, Emre Sezgin, Eric A. Youngstrom</p>
<p>Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLMs) can process requests and generate texts, but their feasibility for assessing complex academic content needs further investigation. To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater. The weaker performance on subjective dimensions indicates that AI should serve a complementary role in evaluation, while human expertise remains essential.</p>

Our analysis shows that the state of the art presents a healthy variety of methods and data, but an over-focus on a single language (English), a single model (BERT), and phenomena that are easy to get at (like part of speech and agreement). Results also suggest that TLMs capture these form-oriented phenomena well, but show more variable and weaker performance on phenomena at the syntax-semantics interface, like binding or filler-gap dependencies. We provide recommendations for future work, in particular reporting complete data, better aligning theoretical constructs and methods across studies, increasing the use of mechanistic methods, and broadening the empirical scope regarding languages and linguistic phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Zhao, Ziyao Liu, Yongsen Zheng, Kwok-Yan Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based question answering (QA) systems play a critical role in modern AI, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, LLM-generated responses often suffer from hallucinations, unfaithful statements lacking reliable references. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks enhance LLM responses by incorporating external references but also introduce new forms of hallucination due to complex interactions between the retriever and generator. To address these challenges, researchers have explored attribution-based techniques that ensure responses are verifiably supported by retrieved content. Despite progress, a unified pipeline for these techniques, along with a clear taxonomy and systematic comparison of their strengths and weaknesses, remains lacking. A well-defined taxonomy is essential for identifying specific failure modes within RAG systems, while comparative analysis helps practitioners choose appropriate solutions based on hallucination types and application context. This survey investigates how attribution-based techniques are used within RAG systems to mitigate hallucinations and addresses the gap by: (i) outlining a taxonomy of hallucination types in RAG systems, (ii) presenting a unified pipeline for attribution techniques, (iii) reviewing techniques based on the hallucinations they target, and (iv) discussing strengths and weaknesses with practical guidelines. This work offers insights for future research and practical use of attribution techniques in RAG systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has catalyzed the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that have pushed reasoning capabilities to new heights. While their performance has garnered significant excitement, exploring the internal mechanisms driving these behaviors has become an equally critical research frontier. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the mechanistic understanding of LRMs, organizing recent findings into three core dimensions: 1) training dynamics, 2) reasoning mechanisms, and 3) unintended behaviors. By synthesizing these insights, we aim to bridge the gap between black-box performance and mechanistic transparency. Finally, we discuss under-explored challenges to outline a roadmap for future mechanistic studies, including the need for applied interpretability, improved methodologies, and a unified theoretical framework.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a hybrid neuro-symbolic system for the SemEval-2026 Task 4 on Narrative Story Similarity. Our approach combines neural self-consistency voting with a novel Multi-Scale Narrative Analysis Ensemble that operates as a symbolic tiebreaker. The neural network component uses a large language model with multiple parallel votes, applying a supermajority threshold for confident decisions and escalating uncertain cases to additional voting rounds. When votes result in a perfect tie, a symbolic ensemble combining five narrative similarity signals (lexical overlap, semantic embeddings, story grammar structure, event chain alignment, and narrative tension curves) provides the final decision. Our cascade architecture achieves 81% accuracy on the development set, demonstrating that selective deferral to symbolic methods can enhance neural predictions on genuinely ambiguous narrative comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruyuan Wan, Changye Li, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Coded language is an important part of human communication. It refers to cases where users intentionally encode meaning so that the surface text differs from the intended meaning and must be decoded to be understood. Current language models handle coded language poorly. Progress has been limited by the lack of real-world datasets and clear taxonomies. This paper introduces CodedLang, a dataset of 7,744 Chinese Google Maps reviews, including 900 reviews with span-level annotations of coded language. We developed a seven-class taxonomy that captures common encoding strategies, including phonetic, orthographic, and cross-lingual substitutions. We benchmarked language models on coded language detection, classification, and review rating prediction. Results show that even strong models can fail to identify or understand coded language. Because many coded expressions rely on pronunciation-based strategies, we further conducted a phonetic analysis of coded and decoded forms. Together, our results highlight coded language as an important and underexplored challenge for real-world NLP systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kei Saito</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR) provides a formal framework for maintaining semantic ambiguity rather than forcing premature interpretation collapse. While the foundational architecture establishes state spaces and operators for ambiguity-preserving computation, the critical question of how natural language maps to these mathematical structures remains open. This paper introduces the text-to-state mapping function {\phi} that transforms linguistic input into superposition states within the NRR framework. We formalize the Contradiction-Preservation Principle, which requires that genuinely ambiguous expressions maintain non-zero entropy in their state representations, and develop extraction protocols using existing Large Language Models as interpretation generators. Empirical validation across 68 test sentences spanning lexical, structural, and pragmatic ambiguity demonstrates that our mapping achieves mean Shannon entropy H(S) = 1.087 bits for ambiguous inputs while baseline single-interpretation approaches yield H(S) = 0.000. The framework provides the missing algorithmic bridge between raw text and the formal state spaces on which NRR operators act, enabling architectural collapse deferment in language model inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claire Nicholson</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks ranging from summarisation to decision support. In practice, identical prompts do not always produce identical outputs, even when temperature and other decoding parameters are fixed. In this work, we conduct repeated-run experiments to empirically quantify baseline behavioural drift, defined as output variability observed when the same prompt is issued multiple times under operator-free conditions. We evaluate two publicly accessible models, gpt-4o-mini and llama3.1-8b, across five prompt categories using exact repeats, perturbed inputs, and reuse modes at temperatures of 0.0 and 0.7. Drift is measured using unique output fractions, lexical similarity, and word count statistics, enabling direct comparison across models, prompting modes, and deployment types. The results show that nondeterminism persists even at temperature 0.0, with distinct variability patterns by model size, deployment, and prompt type. We situate these findings within existing work on concept drift, behavioural drift, and infrastructure-induced nondeterminism, discuss the limitations of lexical metrics, and highlight emerging semantic approaches. By establishing a systematic empirical baseline in the absence of stabilisation techniques, this study provides a reference point for evaluating future drift mitigation and control methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiting Shen, Kun Li, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed for complex, tool-based tasks where long-term memory is critical to driving actions. Existing benchmarks, however, primarily test a angent's ability to passively retrieve isolated facts in response to explicit questions. They fail to evaluate the more crucial capability of actively applying memory to execute tasks. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{Mem2ActBench}, a benchmark for evaluating whether agents can proactively leverage long-term memory to execute tool-based actions by selecting appropriate tools and grounding their parameters. The benchmark simulates persistent assistant usage, where users mention the same topic across long, interrupted interactions and expect previously established preferences and task states to be implicitly applied. We build the dataset with an automated pipeline that merges heterogeneous sources (ToolACE, BFCL, Oasst1), resolves conflicts via consistency modeling, and synthesizes 2,029 sessions with 12 user--assistant--tool turns on average. From these memory chains, a reverse-generation method produces 400 tool-use tasks, with human evaluation confirming 91.3\% are strongly memory-dependent. Experiments on seven memory frameworks show that current systems remain inadequate at actively utilizing memory for parameter grounding, highlighting the need for more effective approaches to evaluate and improve memory application in task execution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) offers significant potential to reduce the workload of medical personnel, for example, through the automation of documentation tasks. While numerous benchmarks exist for the English language, specific evaluations for the German-speaking medical context are still lacking, particularly regarding the inclusion of dialects. In this article, we present a curated dataset of simulated doctor-patient conversations and evaluate a total of 29 different ASR models. The test field encompasses both open-weights models from the Whisper, Voxtral, and Wav2Vec2 families as well as commercial state-of-the-art APIs (AssemblyAI, Deepgram). For evaluation, we utilize three different metrics (WER, CER, BLEU) and provide an outlook on qualitative semantic analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance differences between the models: while the best systems already achieve very good Word Error Rates (WER) of partly below 3%, the error rates of other models, especially concerning medical terminology or dialect-influenced variations, are considerably higher.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micha{\l} Gromadzki, Anna Wr\'oblewska, Agnieszka Kaliska</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models has enabled the generation of text that closely resembles human writing, creating challenges for authenticity verification in education, publishing, and digital security. Detecting AI-generated text has therefore become a crucial technical and ethical issue. This paper presents a comprehensive study of AI-generated text detection based on large-scale corpora and novel training strategies. We introduce a 1-billion-token corpus of human-authored texts spanning multiple genres and a 1.9-billion-token corpus of AI-generated texts produced by prompting a variety of LLMs across diverse domains. Using these resources, we develop and evaluate numerous detection models and propose two novel training paradigms: Per LLM and Per LLM family fine-tuning. Across a 100-million-token benchmark covering 21 large language models, our best fine-tuned detector achieves up to $99.6\%$ token-level accuracy, substantially outperforming existing open-source baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J. Ben Tamo, Daniel Carlander-Reuterfelt, Jonathan Rubin, Dezhi Hong, Mingxian Wang, Oleg Poliannikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite multilingual pretraining, large language models often struggle with non-English tasks, particularly in language control, the ability to respond in the intended language. We identify and characterize two key failure modes: the multilingual transfer bottleneck (correct language, incorrect task response) and the language consistency bottleneck (correct task response, wrong language). To systematically surface these issues, we design a four-scenario evaluation protocol spanning MMLU, MGSM, and XQuAD benchmarks. To probe these issues with interpretability, we extend logit lens analysis to track language probabilities layer by layer and compute cross-lingual semantic similarity of hidden states. The results reveal a three-phase internal structure: early layers align inputs into a shared semantic space, middle layers perform task reasoning, and late layers drive language-specific generation. Guided by these insights, we introduce selective fine-tuning of only the final layers responsible for language control. On Qwen-3-32B and Bloom-7.1B, this method achieves over 98 percent language consistency across six languages while fine-tuning only 3-5 percent of parameters, without sacrificing task accuracy. Importantly, this result is nearly identical to that of full-scope fine-tuning (for example, above 98 percent language consistency for both methods across all prompt scenarios) but uses a fraction of the computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage layer-localization of language control for efficient multilingual adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pragatheeswaran Vipulanandan, Kamal Premaratne, Dilip Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to confabulations, fluent yet unreliable outputs that vary arbitrarily even under identical prompts. Leveraging a quantum tensor network based pipeline, we propose a quantum physics inspired uncertainty quantification framework that accounts for aleatoric uncertainty in token sequence probability for semantic equivalence based clustering of LLM generations. This offers a principled and interpretable scheme for hallucination detection. We further introduce an entropy maximization strategy that prioritizes high certainty, semantically coherent outputs and highlights entropy regions where LLM decisions are likely to be unreliable, offering practical guidelines for when human oversight is warranted. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme under different generation lengths and quantization levels, dimensions overlooked in prior studies, demonstrating that our approach remains reliable even in resource constrained deployments. A total of 116 experiments on TriviaQA, NQ, SVAMP, and SQuAD across multiple architectures including Mistral-7B, Mistral-7B-instruct, Falcon-rw-1b, LLaMA-3.2-1b, LLaMA-2-13b-chat, LLaMA-2-7b-chat, LLaMA-2-13b, and LLaMA-2-7b show consistent improvements in AUROC and AURAC over state of the art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nishanth Sridhar Nakshatri, Eylon Caplan, Rajkumar Pujari, Dan Goldwasser</p>
<p>Abstract: Health influencers play a growing role in shaping public beliefs, yet their content is often conveyed through conversational narratives and rhetorical strategies rather than explicit factual claims. As a result, claim-centric verification methods struggle to capture the pragmatic meaning of influencer discourse. In this paper, we propose TAIGR (Takeaway Argumentation Inference with Grounded References), a structured framework designed to analyze influencer discourse, which operates in three stages: (1) identifying the core influencer recommendation--takeaway; (2) constructing an argumentation graph that captures influencer justification for the takeaway; (3) performing factor graph-based probabilistic inference to validate the takeaway. We evaluate TAIGR on a content validation task over influencer video transcripts on health, showing that accurate validation requires modeling the discourse's pragmatic and argumentative structure rather than treating transcripts as flat collections of claims.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vikash Singh, Darion Cassel, Nathaniel Weir, Nick Feng, Sam Bayless</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the syntactic fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their logical correctness in high-stakes domains remains a fundamental challenge. We present a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with SMT solvers to produce verification-guided answers through iterative refinement. Our approach decomposes LLM outputs into atomic claims, autoformalizes them into first-order logic, and verifies their logical consistency using automated theorem proving. We introduce three key innovations: (1) multi-model consensus via formal semantic equivalence checking to ensure logic-level alignment between candidates, eliminating the syntactic bias of surface-form metrics, (2) semantic routing that directs different claim types to appropriate verification strategies: symbolic solvers for logical claims and LLM ensembles for commonsense reasoning, and (3) precise logical error localization via Minimal Correction Subsets (MCS), which pinpoint the exact subset of claims to revise, transforming binary failure signals into actionable feedback. Our framework classifies claims by their logical status and aggregates multiple verification signals into a unified score with variance-based penalty. The system iteratively refines answers using structured feedback until acceptance criteria are met or convergence is achieved. This hybrid approach delivers formal guarantees where possible and consensus verification elsewhere, advancing trustworthy AI. With the GPT-OSS-120B model, VERGE demonstrates an average performance uplift of 18.7% at convergence across a set of reasoning benchmarks compared to single-pass approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Haji Mohammad Rezaei, Zahra Shakeri</p>
<p>Abstract: Engineering sustainable and equitable healthcare requires medical language models that do not change clinically correct diagnoses when presented with non-decisive cultural information. We introduce a counterfactual benchmark that expands 150 MedQA test items into 1650 variants by inserting culture-related (i) identifier tokens, (ii) contextual cues, or (iii) their combination for three groups (Indigenous Canadian, Middle-Eastern Muslim, Southeast Asian), plus a length-matched neutral control, where a clinician verified that the gold answer remains invariant in all variants. We evaluate GPT-5.2, Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1, and MedGemma (4B/27B) under option-only and brief-explanation prompting. Across models, cultural cues significantly affect accuracy (Cochran's Q, $p<10^-14$), with the largest degradation when identifier and context co-occur (up to 3-7 percentage points under option-only prompting), while neutral edits produce smaller, non-systematic changes. A human-validated rubric ($\kappa=0.76$) applied via an LLM-as-judge shows that more than half of culturally grounded explanations end in an incorrect answer, linking culture-referential reasoning to diagnostic failure. We release prompts and augmentations to support evaluation and mitigation of culturally induced diagnostic errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faezeh Hosseini, Mohammadali Yousefzadeh, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Figurative language, particularly fixed figurative expressions (FFEs) such as idioms and proverbs, poses persistent challenges for large language models (LLMs). Unlike literal phrases, FFEs are culturally grounded, largely non-compositional, and conventionally fixed, making them especially vulnerable to figurative hallucination. We define figurative hallucination as the generation or endorsement of expressions that sound idiomatic and plausible but do not exist as authentic figurative expressions in the target language. We introduce FFEHallu, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating figurative hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on Persian, a linguistically rich yet underrepresented language. FFEHallu consists of 600 carefully curated instances spanning three complementary tasks: (i) FFE generation from meaning, (ii) detection of fabricated FFEs across four controlled construction categories, and (iii) FFE to FFE translation from English to Persian. Evaluating six state of the art multilingual LLMs, we find systematic weaknesses in figurative competence and cultural grounding. While models such as GPT4.1 demonstrate relatively strong performance in rejecting fabricated FFEs and retrieving authentic ones, most models struggle to reliably distinguish real expressions from high quality fabrications and frequently hallucinate during cross lingual translation. These findings reveal substantial gaps in current LLMs handling of figurative language and underscore the need for targeted benchmarks to assess and mitigate figurative hallucination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinated or unverifiable content, undermining their reliability in factual domains. This work investigates Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a training paradigm that explicitly rewards abstention ("I don't know") alongside correctness to promote intellectual humility. We fine-tune and evaluate Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct and Qwen-3-4B-Instruct on the MedMCQA and Hendrycks Math benchmarks using a ternary reward structure ($-1$, r_abs, 1) under varying abstention reward structures. We further study the effect of combining RLVR with supervised fine-tuning strategies that teach abstention prior to reinforcement learning. Our results show that moderate abstention rewards (r_abs $\approx -0.25$ to 0.3) consistently reduce incorrect responses without severe accuracy degradation on multiple-choice tasks, with larger models exhibiting greater robustness to abstention incentives. On open-ended question answering, we observe limitations due to insufficient exploration, which can be partially mitigated through supervised abstention training. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of verifiable reward design as a practical approach for hallucination mitigation in language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akif Islam, Sujan Kumar Roy, Md. Ekramul Hamid</p>
<p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis for the Bengali language has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. However, progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale and diverse annotated datasets. Although several Bengali sentiment and hate speech datasets are publicly available, most are limited in size or confined to a single domain, such as social media comments. Consequently, these resources are often insufficient for training modern deep learning based models, which require large volumes of heterogeneous data to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we introduce BengaliSent140, a large-scale Bengali binary sentiment dataset constructed by consolidating seven existing Bengali text datasets into a unified corpus. To ensure consistency across sources, heterogeneous annotation schemes are systematically harmonized into a binary sentiment formulation with two classes: Not Hate (0) and Hate (1). The resulting dataset comprises 139,792 unique text samples, including 68,548 hate and 71,244 not-hate instances, yielding a relatively balanced class distribution. By integrating data from multiple sources and domains, BengaliSent140 offers broader linguistic and contextual coverage than existing Bengali sentiment datasets and provides a strong foundation for training and benchmarking deep learning models. Baseline experimental results are also reported to demonstrate the practical usability of the dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akifislam/bengalisent140/</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have achieved impressive results across many speech tasks, yet child automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging due to limited data and pretraining domain mismatch. Fine-tuning SSL models on child speech induces shifts in the representation space. We hypothesize that delta SSL embeddings, defined as the differences between embeddings from a finetuned model and those from its pretrained counterpart, encode task-specific information that complements finetuned features from another SSL model. We evaluate multiple fusion strategies on the MyST childrens corpus using different models. Results show that delta embedding fusion with WavLM yields up to a 10 percent relative WER reduction for HuBERT and a 4.4 percent reduction for W2V2, compared to finetuned embedding fusion. Notably, fusing WavLM with delta W2V2 embeddings achieves a WER of 9.64, setting a new state of the art among SSL models on the MyST corpus. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of delta embeddings and highlight feature fusion as a promising direction for advancing child ASR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tool-calling agents are increasingly deployed in real-world customer-facing workflows. Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based mobile agents have made significant performance advancements. However, these agents often follow explicit user instructions while overlooking personalized needs, leading to significant limitations for real users, particularly without personalized context: (1) inability to interpret ambiguous instructions, (2) lack of learning from user interaction history, and (3) failure to handle personalized instructions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose Me-Agent, a learnable and memorable personalized mobile agent. Specifically, Me-Agent incorporates a two-level user habit learning approach. At the prompt level, we design a user preference learning strategy enhanced with a Personal Reward Model to improve personalization performance. At the memory level, we design a Hierarchical Preference Memory, which stores users' long-term memory and app-specific memory in different level memory. To validate the personalization capabilities of mobile agents, we introduce User FingerTip, a new benchmark featuring numerous ambiguous instructions for daily life. Extensive experiments on User FingerTip and general benchmarks demonstrate that Me-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance in personalization while maintaining competitive instruction execution performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Husein Zolkepli</p>
<p>Abstract: X-Codec-2.0 has shown strong performance in neural audio compression and multilingual speech modeling, operating at a 50 Hz latent rate and a 16 kHz sampling rate using frozen HuBERT features. While effective, this configuration limits temporal efficiency and audio fidelity. In this work, we explore a simple and effective modification by introducing additional pooling and increasing the decoder hop size. This reduces the latent rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz and simultaneously raises the output sampling rate from 16 kHz to 24 kHz, improving efficiency and perceptual quality without altering the core architecture. Evaluated on the multilingual Common Voice 17 test set, the proposed configuration achieves a 0.29 MOS improvement over the original X-Codec-2.0 baseline based on UTMOSv2, and attains the best reported performance among all codecs operating at 25 Hz.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyuan Yu, Yuxuan Chen, Minjie Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Full-duplex voice interaction is crucial for natural human computer interaction. We present a framework that decomposes complex dialogue into minimal conversational units, enabling the system to process each unit independently and predict when to transit to the next. This framework is instantiated as a semi-cascaded full-duplex dialogue system built around a multimodal large language model, supported by auxiliary modules such as voice activity detection (VAD) and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. The resulting system operates in a train-free, plug-and-play manner. Experiments on the HumDial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, which ranks second among all teams on the test set of the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (Track 2: Full-Duplex Interaction).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Si Chen, Le Huy Khiem, Annalisa Szymanski, Ronald Metoyer, Ting Hua, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) evaluates a model's ability to perform contextualized reasoning beyond factual recall. This challenge is especially acute in practice-based domains, where knowledge is procedural and grounded in professional judgment, while most existing LLM benchmarks depend on pre-existing human exam datasets that are often unavailable in such settings. We introduce a framework for automated benchmark generation from expert-authored guidelines informed by Bloom's Taxonomy. It converts expert practices into implicit violation-based scenarios and expands them into auto-graded multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and multi-turn dialogues across four cognitive levels, enabling deterministic, reproducible, and scalable evaluation. Applied to three applied domains: teaching, dietetics, and caregiving, we find differences between model and human-like reasoning: LLMs sometimes perform relatively better on higher-order reasoning (Analyze) but fail more frequently on lower-level items (Remember). We produce large-scale, psychometrically informed benchmarks that surface these non-intuitive model behaviors and enable evaluation of contextualized reasoning in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanyu Su, Diana Inkpen, Nathalie Japkowicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Online hate on social media ranges from overt slurs and threats (\emph{hard hate speech}) to \emph{soft hate speech}: discourse that appears reasonable on the surface but uses framing and value-based arguments to steer audiences toward blaming or excluding a target group. We hypothesize that current moderation systems, largely optimized for surface toxicity cues, are not robust to this reasoning-driven hostility, yet existing benchmarks do not measure this gap systematically. We introduce \textbf{\textsc{SoftHateBench}}, a generative benchmark that produces soft-hate variants while preserving the underlying hostile standpoint. To generate soft hate, we integrate the \emph{Argumentum Model of Topics} (AMT) and \emph{Relevance Theory} (RT) in a unified framework: AMT provides the backbone argument structure for rewriting an explicit hateful standpoint into a seemingly neutral discussion while preserving the stance, and RT guides generation to keep the AMT chain logically coherent. The benchmark spans \textbf{7} sociocultural domains and \textbf{28} target groups, comprising \textbf{4,745} soft-hate instances. Evaluations across encoder-based detectors, general-purpose LLMs, and safety models show a consistent drop from hard to soft tiers: systems that detect explicit hostility often fail when the same stance is conveyed through subtle, reasoning-based language. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer.} Contains offensive examples used solely for research.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elina Sigdel, Anastasia Panfilova</p>
<p>Abstract: Defining psycholinguistic characteristics in written texts is a task gaining increasing attention from researchers. One of the most widely used tools in the current field is Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) that originally was developed to analyze English texts and translated into multiple languages. Our approach offers the adaptation of LIWC methodology for the Russian language, considering its grammatical and cultural specificities. The suggested approach comprises 96 categories, integrating syntactic, morphological, lexical, general statistical features, and results of predictions obtained using pre-trained language models (LMs) for text analysis. Rather than applying direct translation to existing thesauri, we built the dictionary specifically for the Russian language based on the content from several lexicographic resources, semantic dictionaries and corpora. The paper describes the process of mapping lemmas to 42 psycholinguistic categories and the implementation of the analyzer as part of RusLICA web service.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwei Lin, Zuyi Zhou, Xinda Zhao, Chenke Wang, Xiaohong Li, Yu Chen, Chuanrui Hu, Jian Pei, Yafeng Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context LLM agents must access the right evidence from large environments and use it faithfully. However, the popular Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) evaluation mostly measures benign span localization. The needle is near-unique, and the haystack is largely irrelevant. We introduce EverMemBench-S (EMB-S), an adversarial NIAH-style benchmark built on a 326M-token MemoryBank. While the full MemoryBank spans 326M tokens for retrieval-based (RAG) evaluation, we evaluate native long-context models only at scales that fit within each model's context window (up to 1M tokens in this work) to ensure a fair comparison. EMB-S pairs queries with collision-tested near-miss hard negatives and gold evidence sets spanning one or more documents, validated via human screening and LLM verification. We also propose a decoupled diagnostic protocol that reports evidence access (document-ID localization) separately from end-to-end QA quality under full-context prompting. This enables consistent diagnosis for both native long-context prompting and retrieval pipelines. Across a reference-corpus ladder from domain-isolated 64K contexts to a globally shared 326M-token environment, we observe a clear reality gap. Systems that saturate benign NIAH degrade sharply in evidence access under semantic interference. These results indicate that semantic discrimination, not context length alone, is the dominant bottleneck for long-context memory at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xu, Minglin Wu, Xueyuan Chen, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has greatly advanced speech representation learning, but multilingual SSL models remain constrained to languages encountered during pretraining. Retraining from scratch to incorporate new languages is computationally expensive, while sequential training without migitation strategies often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose MiLorE-SSL, a lightweight framework that combines LoRA modules with a soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism for efficient continual multilingual training. LoRA provides efficient low-rank adaptation, while soft MoE promotes flexible expert sharing across languages, reducing cross-lingual interference. To further mitigate forgetting, we introduce limited replay data from existing languages, avoiding reliance on large historical corpora. Experiments on ML-SUPERB demonstrate that MiLorE-SSL achieves strong performance in new languages and improves the ability in existing ones with only 2.14% trainable parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyuan Chen, Guangmin Zheng, Jin Wang, Xiaobing Zhou, Xuejie Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing self-evolution methods overlook the influence of fine-grained reasoning steps, which leads to the reasoner-verifier gap. The computational inefficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) process supervision further exacerbates the difficulty in mitigating the gap. Motivated by the Error-Related Negativity (ERN), which the reasoner can localize error following incorrect decisions, guiding rapid adjustments, we propose a Self-Adaptive Process Optimization (SAPO) method for self-improvement in Small Language Models (SLMs). SAPO adaptively and efficiently introduces process supervision signals by actively minimizing the reasoner-verifier gap rather than relying on inefficient MC estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms most existing self-evolution methods on two challenging task types: mathematics and code. Additionally, to further investigate SAPO's impact on verifier performance, this work introduces two new benchmarks for process reward models in both mathematical and coding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Xing, Xing Li, Hui-Ling Zhen, Mingxuan Yuan, Sinno Jialin Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: KV caches, typically used only to speed up autoregressive decoding, encode contextual information that can be reused for downstream tasks at no extra cost. We propose treating the KV cache as a lightweight representation, eliminating the need to recompute or store full hidden states. Despite being weaker than dedicated embeddings, KV-derived representations are shown to be sufficient for two key applications: \textbf{(i) Chain-of-Embedding}, where they achieve competitive or superior performance on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2-7B-Instruct; and \textbf{(ii) Fast/Slow Thinking Switching}, where they enable adaptive reasoning on Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distil-Qwen-14B, reducing token generation by up to $5.7\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. Our findings establish KV caches as a free, effective substrate for sampling and reasoning, opening new directions for representation reuse in LLM inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Hu, Yancheng He, Weixun Wang, Tao Feng, Li Lin, Jiashun Liu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng, Xiaojun Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic evaluation is crucial yet challenging for open-ended natural language generation, especially when rule-based metrics are infeasible. Compared with traditional methods, the recent LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms enable better and more flexible evaluation, and show promise as generative reward models for reinforcement learning. However, prior work has revealed a notable gap between their seemingly impressive benchmark performance and actual effectiveness in RL practice. We attribute this issue to some limitations in existing studies, including the dominance of pairwise evaluation and inadequate optimization of evaluation criteria. Therefore, we propose CE-RM-4B, a pointwise generative reward model trained with a dedicated two-stage rollout method, and adopting unified query-based criteria. Using only about 5.7K high-quality data curated from the open-source preference dataset, our CE-RM-4B achieves superior performance on diverse reward model benchmarks, especially in Best-of-N scenarios, and delivers more effective improvements in downstream RL practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuang Chen, Dazhen Wan, Zhangkai Zheng, Guanqun Bi, Xiyao Xiao, Binghang Li, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models show promise in mental healthcare, evaluating their therapeutic competence remains challenging due to the unstructured and longitudinal nature of counseling. We argue that current evaluation paradigms suffer from an unanchored defect, leading to two forms of instability: process drift, where unsteered client simulation wanders away from specific counseling goals, and standard drift, where static pointwise scoring lacks the stability for reliable judgment. To address this, we introduce Ps, a unified framework that calibrates the therapeutic competence of LLMs via trajectory-anchored tournaments. We first anchor the interaction trajectory in simulation, where clients precisely control the fluid consultation process to probe multifaceted capabilities. We then anchor the battle trajectory in judgments through an efficient Swiss-system tournament, utilizing dynamic pairwise battles to yield robust Elo ratings. Beyond ranking, we demonstrate that tournament trajectories can be transformed into credible reward signals, enabling on-policy reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PsychePass and its strong consistency with human expert judgments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinzhuo Wu, Zhizhuo Yang, Hanhao Li, Pengzhi Gao, Wei Liu, Jian Luan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents highlight the growing need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. While new online benchmarks offer more realistic testing than offline ones, they tend to focus on the agents' task instruction-following ability while neglecting their reasoning and exploration ability. Moreover, these benchmarks do not consider the random noise in real-world mobile environments. This leads to a gap between benchmarks and real-world environments. To addressing these limitations, we propose MobileBench-OL, an online benchmark with 1080 tasks from 80 Chinese apps. It measures task execution, complex reasoning, and noise robustness of agents by including 5 subsets, which set multiple evaluation dimensions. We also provide an auto-eval framework with a reset mechanism, enabling stable and repeatable real-world benchmarking. Evaluating 12 leading GUI agents on MobileBench-OL shows significant room for improvement to meet real-world requirements. Human evaluation further confirms that MobileBench-OL can reliably measure the performance of leading GUI agents in real environments. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer order-agnostic generation that can explore many possible decoding trajectories. However, current decoding methods commit to a single trajectory, limiting exploration in trajectory space. We introduce Order-Token Search to explore this space through jointly searching over generation order and token values. Its core is a likelihood estimator that scores denoising actions, enabling stable pruning and efficient exploration of diverse trajectories. Across mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks, Order-Token Search consistently outperforms baselines on GSM8K, MATH500, Countdown, and HumanEval (3.1%, 3.8%, 7.9%, and 6.8% absolute over backbone), matching or surpassing diffu-GRPO post-trained d1-LLaDA. Our work establishes joint search as a key component for advancing decoding in DLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihao Wang, Yue Hu, Mingzhe Lu, Jiayue Wu, Yanbing Liu, Yuanmin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use external tools unlocks powerful real-world interactions, making rigorous evaluation essential. However, current benchmarks primarily report final accuracy, revealing what models can do but obscuring the cognitive bottlenecks that define their true capability boundaries. To move from simple performance scoring to a diagnostic tool, we introduce a framework grounded in Cognitive Load Theory. Our framework deconstructs task complexity into two quantifiable components: Intrinsic Load, the inherent structural complexity of the solution path, formalized with a novel Tool Interaction Graph; and Extraneous Load, the difficulty arising from ambiguous task presentation. To enable controlled experiments, we construct ToolLoad-Bench, the first benchmark with parametrically adjustable cognitive load. Our evaluation reveals distinct performance cliffs as cognitive load increases, allowing us to precisely map each model's capability boundary. We validate that our framework's predictions are highly calibrated with empirical results, establishing a principled methodology for understanding an agent's limits and a practical foundation for building more efficient systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Biswesh Mohapatra, Marcely Zanon Boito, Ioan Calapodescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current speech LLMs bridge speech foundation models to LLMs using projection layers, training all of these components on speech instruction data. This strategy is computationally intensive and susceptible to task and prompt overfitting. We present SpeechMapper, a cost-efficient speech-to-LLM-embedding training approach that mitigates overfitting, enabling more robust and generalizable models. Our model is first pretrained without the LLM on inexpensive hardware, and then efficiently attached to the target LLM via a brief 1K-step instruction tuning (IT) stage. Through experiments on speech translation and spoken question answering, we demonstrate the versatility of SpeechMapper's pretrained block, presenting results for both task-agnostic IT, an ASR-based adaptation strategy that does not train in the target task, and task-specific IT. In task-agnostic settings, Speechmapper rivals the best instruction-following speech LLM from IWSLT25, despite never being trained on these tasks, while in task-specific settings, it outperforms this model across many datasets, despite requiring less data and compute. Overall, SpeechMapper offers a practical and scalable approach for efficient, generalizable speech-LLM integration without large-scale IT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna Ristil\"a, Otto Tarkka, Veronika Laippala, Kimmo Elo</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing research often treats parliamentary discourse as a homogeneous whole, overlooking topic-specific patterns. Parliamentary speeches address a wide range of topics, some of which evoke stronger emotions than others. While everyone has intuitive assumptions about what the most emotive topics in a parliament may be, there has been little research into the emotions typically linked to different topics. This paper strives to fill this gap by examining emotion expression among the topics of parliamentary speeches delivered in Eduskunta, the Finnish Parliament, between 2000 and 2020. An emotion analysis model is used to investigate emotion expression in topics, from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The results strengthen evidence of increasing positivity in parliamentary speech and provide further insights into topic-specific emotion expression within parliamentary debate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models show great potential with external tools, but face significant challenges in complex, multi-turn tool invocation. They often exhibit weak planning, tool hallucination, erroneous parameter generation, and struggle with robust interaction. To tackle these issues, we present PEARL, a novel framework to enhance LLM planning and execution for sophisticated tool use. PEARL adopts a two-stage approach: an offline phase where the agent explores tools to learn valid usage patterns and failure conditions, and an online reinforcement learning phase. In the online phase, a dedicated Planner is trained via group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a carefully designed reward function that provides distinct signals for planning quality. Experiments on the ToolHop and T-Eval benchmarks show PEARL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art success rate of \textbf{56.5\%} on ToolHop while maintaining a low invocation error rate. Our work marks a key advance in addressing the complex planning challenges of tool use, contributing to the development of more robust and reliable LLM-based agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diandian Guo, Fangfang Yuan, Cong Cao, Xixun Lin, Chuan Zhou, Hao Peng, Yanan Cao, Yanbing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevalence of sarcasm in multimodal dialogues on the social platforms presents a crucial yet challenging task for understanding the true intent behind online content. Comprehensive sarcasm analysis requires two key aspects: Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation (MuSE). Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language-model-based agents operating over extended interaction horizons face persistent challenges in preserving temporally grounded information and maintaining behavioral consistency across sessions, a failure mode we term soul erosion. We present BMAM (Brain-inspired Multi-Agent Memory), a general-purpose memory architecture that models agent memory as a set of functionally specialized subsystems rather than a single unstructured store. Inspired by cognitive memory systems, BMAM decomposes memory into episodic, semantic, salience-aware, and control-oriented components that operate at complementary time scales. To support long-horizon reasoning, BMAM organizes episodic memories along explicit timelines and retrieves evidence by fusing multiple complementary signals. Experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark show that BMAM achieves 78.45 percent accuracy under the standard long-horizon evaluation setting, and ablation analyses confirm that the hippocampus-inspired episodic memory subsystem plays a critical role in temporal reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has found a widespread use in computing education; at the same time, quality of generated materials raises concerns among educators and students. This study addresses this issue by introducing a novel method for diagram code generation with in-context examples based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), which aims to improve diagram generation by aligning models' output with user expectations. Our approach is evaluated by computer science educators, who assessed 150 diagrams generated with large language models (LLMs) for logical organization, connectivity, layout aesthetic, and AI hallucination. The assessment dataset is additionally investigated for its utility in automated diagram evaluation. The preliminary results suggest that our method decreases the rate of factual hallucination and improves diagram faithfulness to provided context; however, due to LLMs' stochasticity, the quality of the generated diagrams varies. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis and discussion on the connection between AI hallucination and the quality of generated diagrams, which reveals that text contexts of higher complexity lead to higher rates of hallucination and LLMs often fail to detect mistakes in their output.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kumiko Nakajima, Jan Zuiderveld, Sandro Pezzelle</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in verbal creative tasks. However, previous assessments of the creative capabilities of LLMs remain weakly grounded in human creativity theory and are thus hard to interpret. The widely used Divergent Association Task (DAT) focuses on novelty, ignoring appropriateness, a core component of creativity. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs on DAT and show that their scores on the task are lower than those of two baselines that do not possess any creative abilities, undermining its validity for model evaluation. Grounded in human creativity theory, which defines creativity as the combination of novelty and appropriateness, we introduce Conditional Divergent Association Task (CDAT). CDAT evaluates novelty conditional on contextual appropriateness, separating noise from creativity better than DAT, while remaining simple and objective. Under CDAT, smaller model families often show the most creativity, whereas advanced families favor appropriateness at lower novelty. We hypothesize that training and alignment likely shift models along this frontier, making outputs more appropriate but less creative. We release the dataset and code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shalom Rosner, Ronit D. Gross, Ella Koresh, Ido Kanter</p>
<p>Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in statistical mechanics primarily occurs during phase transitions at the thermodynamic limit where the Hamiltonian preserves inversion symmetry, yet the low-temperature free energy exhibits reduced symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in natural language processing (NLP) models during both pre-training and fine-tuning, even under deterministic dynamics and within a finite training architecture. This phenomenon occurs at the level of individual attention heads and is scaled-down to its small subset of nodes and also valid at a single-nodal level, where nodes acquire the capacity to learn a limited set of tokens after pre-training or labels after fine-tuning for a specific classification task. As the number of nodes increases, a crossover in learning ability occurs, governed by the tradeoff between a decrease following random-guess among increased possible outputs, and enhancement following nodal cooperation, which exceeds the sum of individual nodal capabilities. In contrast to spin-glass systems, where a microscopic state of frozen spins cannot be directly linked to the free-energy minimization goal, each nodal function in this framework contributes explicitly to the global network task and can be upper-bounded using convex hull analysis. Results are demonstrated using BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel classification task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Basirat, Danial Namazifard, Navid Baradaran Hemmati</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate structural traces of language contact in the intermediate representations of a monolingual language model. Focusing on Persian (Farsi) as a historically contact-rich language, we probe the representations of a Persian-trained model when exposed to languages with varying degrees and types of contact with Persian. Our methodology quantifies the amount of linguistic information encoded in intermediate representations and assesses how this information is distributed across model components for different morphosyntactic features. The results show that universal syntactic information is largely insensitive to historical contact, whereas morphological features such as Case and Gender are strongly shaped by language-specific structure, suggesting that contact effects in monolingual language models are selective and structurally constrained.</p>

<p>Abstract: The capacity of AI agents to effectively handle tasks of increasing duration and complexity continues to grow, demonstrating exceptional performance in coding, deep research, and complex problem-solving evaluations. However, in daily scenarios, the perception of these advanced AI capabilities among general users remains limited. We argue that current evaluations prioritize increasing task difficulty without sufficiently addressing the diversity of agentic tasks necessary to cover the daily work, life, and learning activities of a broad demographic. To address this, we propose AgentIF-OneDay, aimed at determining whether general users can utilize natural language instructions and AI agents to complete a diverse array of daily tasks. These tasks require not only solving problems through dialogue but also understanding various attachment types and delivering tangible file-based results. The benchmark is structured around three user-centric categories: Open Workflow Execution, which assesses adherence to explicit and complex workflows; Latent Instruction, which requires agents to infer implicit instructions from attachments; and Iterative Refinement, which involves modifying or expanding upon ongoing work. We employ instance-level rubrics and a refined evaluation pipeline that aligns LLM-based verification with human judgment, achieving an 80.1% agreement rate using Gemini-3-Pro. AgentIF-OneDay comprises 104 tasks covering 767 scoring points. We benchmarked four leading general AI agents and found that agent products built based on APIs and ChatGPT agents based on agent RL remain in the first tier simultaneously. Leading LLM APIs and open-source models have internalized agentic capabilities, enabling AI application teams to develop cutting-edge Agent products.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenlin Zhong, Chengyuan Liu, Yiquan Wu, Bovin Tan, Changlong Sun, Yi Wang, Xiaozhong Liu, Kun Kuang</p>
<p>Abstract: While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced LLM reasoning in structured domains like mathematics and programming, its application to general-domain reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of verifiable reward signals. To this end, methods like Reinforcement Learning with Reference Probability Reward (RLPR) have emerged, leveraging the probability of generating the final answer as a reward signal. However, these outcome-focused approaches neglect crucial step-by-step supervision of the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we introduce Probabilistic Process Supervision (P2S), a novel self-supervision framework that provides fine-grained process rewards without requiring a separate reward model or human-annotated reasoning steps. During reinforcement learning, P2S synthesizes and filters a high-quality reference reasoning chain (gold-CoT). The core of our method is to calculate a Path Faithfulness Reward (PFR) for each reasoning step, which is derived from the conditional probability of generating the gold-CoT's suffix, given the model's current reasoning prefix. Crucially, this PFR can be flexibly integrated with any outcome-based reward, directly tackling the reward sparsity problem by providing dense guidance. Extensive experiments on reading comprehension and medical Question Answering benchmarks show that P2S significantly outperforms strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Candussio</p>
<p>Abstract: Assessing ways in which Language Models can reduce their hallucinations and improve the outputs' quality is crucial to ensure their large-scale use.
  However, methods such as fine-tuning on domain-specific data or the training of a separate \textit{ad hoc} verifier require demanding computational resources (not feasible for many user applications) and constrain the models to specific fields of knowledge.
  In this thesis, we propose a dialectic pipeline that preserves LLMs' generalization abilities while improving the quality of its answer via self-dialogue, enabling it to reflect upon and correct tentative wrong answers.
  We experimented with different pipeline settings, testing our proposed method on different datasets and on different families of models. All the pipeline stages are enriched with the relevant context (in an oracle-RAG setting) and a study on the impact of its summarization or its filtering is conducted.
  We find that our proposed dialectic pipeline is able to outperform by significative margins the standard model answers and that it consistently achieves higher performances than Chain-of-Thought only prompting.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to two foundational Electronic Health Record (EHR) data science tasks: structured data querying (using programmatic languages, Python/Pandas) and information extraction from unstructured clinical text via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We test the ability of LLMs to interact accurately with large structured datasets for analytics and the reliability of LLMs in extracting semantically correct information from free text health records when supported by RAG. To this end, we presented a flexible evaluation framework that automatically generates synthetic question and answer pairs tailored to the characteristics of each dataset or task. Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to support precise querying and accurate information extraction in clinical workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuo Chen, Xinyu Geng, Xinyu Wang, Yong Jiang, Zhen Zhang, Pengjun Xie, Kewei Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Question-Answering (VQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires integrating visual and textual information to generate accurate responses. While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including a Deep Research agent and a carefully designed prompt-based method, on average over six various datasets. Code will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqiao Mo, Yunlong Tan, Hao Zhang, Heng Zhang, Yangfan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their potential for software protection remains largely untapped. Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our method achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o., and improves binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10% over state of art methods like jTrans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ostap Vykhopen, Viktoria Skorik, Maxim Tereschenko, Veronika Solopova</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated narrative intelligence systems for social media monitoring face significant scalability challenges when processing continuous data streams using traditional batch clustering algorithms. We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts. This research addresses a critical gap between batch-oriented topic modeling frameworks and the streaming nature of social media monitoring, with implications for computational social science, crisis informatics, and narrative surveillance systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Fang, Yuxin Wang, XiaoRan Liu, Jiahao Lu, Chuanyuan Tan, Xinchi Chen, Yining Zheng. Xuanjing Huang, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents necessitates the management of extensive, dynamic contexts. Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query. This factor explains why the high information density inherent in massive tool responses poses a significantly greater challenge than the memory fragmentation typical of long-turn dialogues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mae Sosto, Delfina Sol Martinez Pandiani, Laura Hollink</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce societal norms, particularly heterocisnormativity, and how these norms translate into measurable biases in their text generations. We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized "unmarked" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for emotional support and mental health-related interactions outside clinical settings, yet little is known about how people evaluate and relate to these systems in everyday use. We analyze 5,126 Reddit posts from 47 mental health communities describing experiential or exploratory use of AI for emotional support or therapy. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation. Overall, this work demonstrates how theory-grounded constructs can be operationalized in large-scale discourse analysis and highlights the importance of studying how users interpret language technologies in sensitive, real-world contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Yang, Moritz Hechtbauer, Elisabeth Khalilov, Evelyn Luise Brinkmann, Vera Schmitt, Nils Feldhus</p>
<p>Abstract: For socially sensitive tasks like hate speech detection, the quality of explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for factors like user trust and model alignment. While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ethan Shen, Danny Tormoen, Saurabh Shah, Ali Farhadi, Tim Dettmers</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-weight coding agents should hold a fundamental advantage over closed-source systems: they can be specialized to private codebases, encoding repository-specific information directly in their weights. Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now practical. We present Soft-Verified Efficient Repository Agents (SERA), an efficient method for training coding agents that enables the rapid and cheap creation of agents specialized to private codebases. Using only supervised finetuning (SFT), SERA achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open-source (open data, method, code) models while matching the performance of frontier open-weight models like Devstral-Small-2. Creating SERA models is 26x cheaper than reinforcement learning and 57x cheaper than previous synthetic data methods to reach equivalent performance. Our method, Soft Verified Generation (SVG), generates thousands of trajectories from a single code repository. Combined with cost-efficiency, this enables specialization to private codebases. Beyond repository specialization, we apply SVG to a larger corpus of codebases, generating over 200,000 synthetic trajectories. We use this dataset to provide detailed analysis of scaling laws, ablations, and confounding factors for training coding agents. Overall, we believe our work will greatly accelerate research on open coding agents and showcase the advantage of open-source models that can specialize to private codebases. We release SERA as the first model in Ai2's Open Coding Agents series, along with all our code, data, and Claude Code integration to support the research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Huang, Karsten Roth, Quentin Bouniot, Wenjia Xu, Zeynep Akata</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal large language models often exhibit in-context learning (ICL) abilities. Motivated by this phenomenon, we ask: how do transformers learn to associate information across modalities from in-context examples? We investigate this question through controlled experiments on small transformers trained on synthetic classification tasks, enabling precise manipulation of data statistics and model architecture. We begin by revisiting core principles of unimodal ICL in modern transformers. While several prior findings replicate, we find that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) increases the data complexity threshold for ICL. Extending to the multimodal setting reveals a fundamental learning asymmetry: when pretrained on high-diversity data from a primary modality, surprisingly low data complexity in the secondary modality suffices for multimodal ICL to emerge. Mechanistic analysis shows that both settings rely on an induction-style mechanism that copies labels from matching in-context exemplars; multimodal training refines and extends these circuits across modalities. Our findings provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding multimodal ICL in modern transformers and introduce a controlled testbed for future investigation.</p>

Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy for example selection, in which new examples are selected based on the similarity of their underlying syntactic-semantic structure to the provided one-shot example. We show that this method results in complementary word choices and sentence structures when compared to LLM-generated examples. When these strategies are combined, the resulting hybrid system achieves a more holistic picture of the relations of interest than either method alone. Our framework transfers well across datasets (FS-TACRED and FS-FewRel) and LLM families (Qwen and Gemma). Overall, our hybrid selection method consistently outperforms alternative strategies and achieves state-of-the-art performance on FS-TACRED and strong gains on a customized FewRel subset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Yuxuan Li, Eghbal Hosseini, Sangnie Bhardwaj, Murray Shanahan</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model representations often contain linear directions that correspond to high-level concepts. Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the beginning of a conversation can be represented as non-factual at the end and vice versa. These changes are content-dependent; while representations of conversation-relevant information may change, generic information is generally preserved. These changes are robust even for dimensions that disentangle factuality from more superficial response patterns, and occur across different model families and layers of the model. These representation changes do not require on-policy conversations; even replaying a conversation script written by an entirely different model can produce similar changes. However, adaptation is much weaker from simply having a sci-fi story in context that is framed more explicitly as such. We also show that steering along a representational direction can have dramatically different effects at different points in a conversation. These results are consistent with the idea that representations may evolve in response to the model playing a particular role that is cued by a conversation. Our findings may pose challenges for interpretability and steering -- in particular, they imply that it may be misleading to use static interpretations of features or directions, or probes that assume a particular range of features consistently corresponds to a particular ground-truth value. However, these types of representational dynamics also point to exciting new research directions for understanding how models adapt to context.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be benchmark-contaminated, resulting in inflated scores that mask memorization as generalization, and in multilingual settings, this memorization can even transfer to "uncontaminated" languages. Using the FLORES-200 translation benchmark as a diagnostic, we study two 7-8B instruction-tuned multilingual LLMs: Bloomz, which was trained on FLORES, and Llama as an uncontaminated control. We confirm Bloomz's FLORES contamination and demonstrate that machine translation contamination can be cross-directional, artificially boosting performance in unseen translation directions due to target-side memorization. Further analysis shows that recall of memorized references often persists despite various source-side perturbation efforts like paraphrasing and named entity replacement. However, replacing named entities leads to a consistent decrease in BLEU, suggesting an effective probing method for memorization in contaminated models.</p>

Dataflow AI accelerators present a promising alternative; however, there remains a lack of in-depth performance analysis and standardized benchmarking methodologies for LLM training. We introduce DABench-LLM, the first benchmarking framework designed for evaluating LLM workloads on dataflow-based accelerators. By combining intra-chip performance profiling and inter-chip scalability analysis, DABench-LLM enables comprehensive evaluation across key metrics such as resource allocation, load balance, and resource efficiency. The framework helps researchers rapidly gain insights into underlying hardware and system behaviors, and provides guidance for performance optimizations. We validate DABench-LLM on three commodity dataflow accelerators, Cerebras WSE-2, SambaNova RDU, and Graphcore IPU. Our framework reveals performance bottlenecks and provides specific optimization strategies, demonstrating its generality and effectiveness across a diverse range of dataflow-based AI hardware platforms.</p>

Existing state-of-the-art methods typically rely on token likelihoods, yet they often overlook the divergence from the model's top-1 prediction and local correlation between adjacent tokens. In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations. Extensive experiments on the WikiMIA and MIMIR benchmarks demonstrate that Gap-K% achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming prior baselines across various model sizes and input lengths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Faruk Alpay, Bugra Kilictas</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the emergence of multi-step reasoning in deep Transformer language models through a geometric and statistical-physics lens. Treating the hidden-state trajectory as a flow on an implicit Riemannian manifold, we analyze the layerwise covariance spectrum of activations, where $C^{(\ell)}=\mathbb{E}[h^{(\ell)}h^{(\ell)\top}]$, and track deviations from a random-matrix bulk. Across model scales (1.5B--30B), we observe a sharp reduction in effective dimensionality consistent with a phase transition: an order parameter based on sparsity/localization, $\Omega(h)=1-\|h\|_1/(\sqrt{d}\|h\|_2)$, exhibits a discontinuity near a critical normalized depth $\gamma_c\approx 0.42$ in sufficiently large models. We formalize the forward pass as a discrete coarse-graining map and relate the appearance of stable "concept basins" to fixed points of this renormalization-like dynamics. The resulting low-entropy regime is characterized by a spectral tail collapse and by the formation of transient, reusable object-like structures in representation space, which we call Transient Class Objects (TCOs). We provide theoretical conditions connecting logical separability to spectral decay and validate the predicted signatures with layerwise probes on multiple open-weight model families.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mandip Goswami</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite decades of research on reverberant speech, comparing methods remains difficult because most corpora lack per-file acoustic annotations or provide limited documentation for reproduction. We present RIR-Mega-Speech, a corpus of approximately 117.5 hours created by convolving LibriSpeech utterances with roughly 5,000 simulated room impulse responses from the RIR-Mega collection. Every file includes RT60, direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity index ($C_{50}$) computed from the source RIR using clearly defined, reproducible procedures. We also provide scripts to rebuild the dataset and reproduce all evaluation results.
  Using Whisper small on 1,500 paired utterances, we measure 5.20% WER (95% CI: 4.69--5.78) on clean speech and 7.70% (7.04--8.35) on reverberant versions, corresponding to a paired increase of 2.50 percentage points (2.06--2.98). This represents a 48% relative degradation. WER increases monotonically with RT60 and decreases with DRR, consistent with prior perceptual studies. While the core finding that reverberation harms recognition is well established, we aim to provide the community with a standardized resource where acoustic conditions are transparent and results can be verified independently. The repository includes one-command rebuild instructions for both Windows and Linux environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jincheng Bai, Zhenyu Zhang, Jennifer Zhang, Zhihuai Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuchenyang Liu, Ziyu Hu, Yao Zhang, Yu Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (e.g., ColPali) enable fine-grained Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) but incur prohibitive index vector size overheads. Training-free pruning solutions (e.g., EOS-attention based methods) can reduce index vector size by approximately 60% without model adaptation, but often underperform random selection in high-compression scenarios (> 80%). Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency. Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG. Furthermore, our OSR-based analysis reveals that semantic structural anchor patches persist in the middle layers, unlike traditional pruning solutions that focus on the final layer where structural signals dissipate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jim Maar, Denis Paperno, Callum Stuart McDougall, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Prior work suggests that language models, while trained on next token prediction, show implicit planning behavior: they may select the next token in preparation to a predicted future token, such as a likely rhyming word, as supported by a prior qualitative study of Claude 3.5 Haiku using a cross-layer transcoder. We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. "-ight") or answer to a question ("whale") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters. Our methodology offers a widely applicable direct way to study implicit planning abilities of LLMs. More broadly, understanding planning abilities of language models can inform decisions in AI safety and control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyang Wu, Shuo Yang, Changpeng Yang, Yuhao Shen, Shuai Zhang, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has empowered large language models to act as intelligent agents, yet training them for long-horizon tasks remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality trajectories, especially under limited resources. Existing methods typically scale up rollout sizes and indiscriminately allocate computational resources among intermediate steps. Such attempts inherently waste substantial computation budget on trivial steps while failing to guarantee sample quality. To address this, we propose \textbf{Spark} (\textbf{S}trategic \textbf{P}olicy-\textbf{A}ware explo\textbf{R}ation via \textbf{K}ey-state dynamic branching), a novel framework that selectively branches at critical decision states for resource-efficient exploration. Our key insight is to activate adaptive branching exploration at critical decision points to probe promising trajectories, thereby achieving precise resource allocation that prioritizes sampling quality over blind coverage. This design leverages the agent's intrinsic decision-making signals to reduce dependence on human priors, enabling the agent to autonomously expand exploration and achieve stronger generalization. Experiments across diverse tasks (e.g., embodied planning), demonstrate that \textsc{Spark} achieves superior success rates with significantly fewer training samples, exhibiting robust generalization even in unseen scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueyang Wang, Jiawei Fu, Baolong Bi, Xili Wang, Xiaoqing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: SWE-bench has emerged as the premier benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on complex software engineering tasks. While these capabilities are fundamentally acquired during the mid-training phase and subsequently elicited during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), there remains a critical deficit in metrics capable of guiding mid-training effectively. Standard metrics such as Perplexity (PPL) are compromised by the "Long-Context Tax" and exhibit weak correlation with downstream SWE performance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by first introducing a rigorous data filtering strategy. Crucially, we propose the Entropy Compression Hypothesis, redefining intelligence not by scalar Top-1 compression, but by the capacity to structure uncertainty into Entropy-Compressed States of low orders ("reasonable hesitation"). Grounded in this fine-grained entropy analysis, we formulate a novel metric, HE-SNR (High-Entropy Signal-to-Noise Ratio). Validated on industrial-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models across varying context windows (32K/128K), our approach demonstrates superior robustness and predictive power. This work provides both the theoretical foundation and practical tools for optimizing the latent potential of LLMs in complex engineering domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural ranking models (NRMs) achieve strong retrieval effectiveness, yet prior work has shown they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We revisit this robustness question with a minimal, query-aware attack that promotes a target document by inserting or substituting a single, semantically aligned word - the query center. We study heuristic and gradient-guided variants, including a white-box method that identifies influential insertion points. On TREC-DL 2019/2020 with BERT and monoT5 re-rankers, our single-word attacks achieve up to 91% success while modifying fewer than two tokens per document on average, achieving competitive rank and score boosts with far fewer edits under a comparable white-box setup to ensure fair evaluation against PRADA. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze attack sensitivity beyond aggregate success rates. Our analysis reveals a Goldilocks zone in which mid-ranked documents are most vulnerable. These findings demonstrate practical risks and motivate future defenses for robust neural ranking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Alex Qiu, Micah Carroll, Cameron Allen</p>
<p>Abstract: The evaluation and post-training of large language models (LLMs) rely on supervision, but strong supervision for difficult tasks is often unavailable, especially when evaluating frontier models. In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has proven effective for accelerating LLM inference by quickly generating draft tokens and verifying them in parallel. However, SD remains largely unexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which extend LLMs to process both image and text prompts. To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing. With its plug-and-play compatibility, we further enhance TABED by integrating advanced verification and alternative drafting methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Huang, Anda Cheng, Yinggui Wang, Lei Wang, Tao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanqi Dai, Yuxiang Ji, Xiao Zhang, Yong Wang, Xiangxiang Chu, Zhiwu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuguang Zhang, Junhong Lian, Guoxin Yu, Baoxun Xu, Xiang Ao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcasm within image-text pairs by modeling semantic incongruities across modalities. Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: As conversational agents become increasingly common in behaviour change interventions, understanding optimal feedback delivery mechanisms becomes increasingly important. However, choosing a style that both lessens psychological reactance (perceived threats to freedom) while simultaneously eliciting feelings of surprise and engagement represents a complex design problem. We explored how three different feedback styles: 'Direct', 'Politeness', and 'Verbal Leakage' (slips or disfluencies to reveal a desired behaviour) affect user perceptions and behavioural intentions. Matching expectations from literature, the 'Direct' chatbot led to lower behavioural intentions and higher reactance, while the 'Politeness' chatbot evoked higher behavioural intentions and lower reactance. However, 'Politeness' was also seen as unsurprising and unengaging by participants. In contrast, 'Verbal Leakage' evoked reactance, yet also elicited higher feelings of surprise, engagement, and humour. These findings highlight that effective feedback requires navigating trade-offs between user reactance and engagement, with novel approaches such as 'Verbal Leakage' offering promising alternative design opportunities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Privacy policies are supposed to provide notice. But what if substantive information appears only where users skip it? We identify a structural pattern we call jurisdiction-siloed disclosure: information about data practices appearing in specific, actionable form only within regional compliance sections labeled "California Residents" or "EU/UK Users," while general sections use vague or qualified language for the same practices.
  Our audit of 123 major companies identifies 282 potential instances across 77 companies (62.6% of this purposive sample). A conservative estimate restricted to practice categories validated against OPP-115 human annotations finds 138 instances across 54 companies (44%); post-2018 categories central to our findings await independent validation. If users skip jurisdiction-labeled sections as information foraging theory predicts, users outside regulated jurisdictions would receive less specific information about practices affecting them--a transparency failure operating through document architecture rather than omission.
  We propose universal substantive disclosure: practices affecting all users should appear in the main policy body, with regional sections containing only procedural rights information. This standard finds support in analogous disclosure regimes (securities, truth-in-lending, nutritional labeling) where material information must reach all affected parties. Regulators could operationalize this through the FTC's "clear and conspicuous" standard and GDPR transparency principles.
  This work is hypothesis-generating: we establish that the structural pattern exists and ground the transparency concern in behavioral theory, but direct measurement of jurisdiction-specific section skipping remains the critical validation priority. We release our methodology and annotated dataset to enable replication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minwu Kim, Safal Shrestha, Keith Ross</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus. Overall, our results suggest that failure-prefix conditioning offers an effective pathway to extend RLVR training on saturated problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Christian, Jessica A. F. Thompson, Elle Michelle Yang, Vincent Adam, Hannah Rose Kirk, Christopher Summerfield, Tsvetomira Dumbalska</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the "Big Two" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for "agency" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for "communion." This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Immanuel Abdi, Akshat Gupta, Micah Mok, Alexander Lu, Nicholas Lee, Gopala Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Bouchard</p>
<p>Abstract: Bias and fairness risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) vary substantially across deployment contexts, yet existing approaches lack systematic guidance for selecting appropriate evaluation metrics. We present a decision framework that maps LLM use cases, characterized by a model and population of prompts, to relevant bias and fairness metrics based on task type, whether prompts contain protected attribute mentions, and stakeholder priorities. Our framework addresses toxicity, stereotyping, counterfactual unfairness, and allocational harms, and introduces novel metrics based on stereotype classifiers and counterfactual adaptations of text similarity measures. All metrics require only LLM outputs for computation, simplifying implementation while avoiding embedding-based approaches that often correlate poorly with downstream harms. We provide an open-source Python library, LangFair, for practical adoption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fairness risks cannot be reliably assessed from benchmark performance alone: results on one prompt dataset likely overstate or understate risks for another, underscoring that fairness evaluation must be grounded in the specific deployment context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danlu Chen, Freda Shi, Aditi Agarwal, Jacobo Myerston, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick</p>
<p>Abstract: Standard natural language processing (NLP) pipelines operate on symbolic representations of language, which typically consist of sequences of discrete tokens. However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert knowledge. At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.
  This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution. We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones. The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingjian Tao, Yiwei Wang, Yujun Cai, Zhicheng Yang, Jing Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as parametric knowledge bases, but often underperform on question answering (QA) tasks due to hallucinations and uncertainty. While prior work attributes these failures to knowledge gaps in the model's parameters, we uncover a complementary phenomenon: LLMs frequently retain correct knowledge even when generating incorrect or "unsure" answers. By analyzing the token-level output distributions, we find that correct answers often appear among high-probability candidates, despite not being selected. Motivated by this, we propose Hits@k, a novel metric to evaluate latent knowledge retention independent of answer surface form. Our experiments reveal that LLMs possess significantly more factual knowledge than is reflected by standard QA accuracy. Building on these insights, we further examine the prevailing few-shot QA paradigm. We find that prompting strategies which allow "unsure" outputs can inadvertently suppress correct answers by discouraging low-confidence generation. We design a set of quantitative experiments to measure this suppression effect, offering practical guidance for future prompt and decoding design in knowledge-intensive tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce k-NLPmeans and k-LLMmeans, text-clustering variants of k-means that periodically replace numeric centroids with textual summaries. The key idea, summary-as-centroid, retains k-means assignments in embedding space while producing human-readable, auditable cluster prototypes. The method is LLM-optional: k-NLPmeans uses lightweight, deterministic summarizers, enabling offline, low-cost, and stable operation; k-LLMmeans is a drop-in upgrade that uses an LLM for summaries under a fixed per-iteration budget whose cost does not grow with dataset size. We also present a mini-batch extension for real-time clustering of streaming text. Across diverse datasets, embedding models, and summarization strategies, our approach consistently outperforms classical baselines and approaches the accuracy of recent LLM-based clustering-without extensive LLM calls. Finally, we provide a case study on sequential text streams and release a StackExchange-derived benchmark for evaluating streaming text clustering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Sharma, Christopher J. Pal, Amal Zouaq</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to generate SPARQL queries from natural language questions is crucial for ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval of structured data from knowledge graphs (KG). While large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for SPARQL query generation, they are often susceptible to hallucinations and out-of-distribution errors when generating KG elements, such as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), based on opaque internal parametric knowledge. We propose PGMR (Post-Generation Memory Retrieval), a modular framework where the LLM produces an intermediate query using natural language placeholders for URIs, and a non-parametric memory module is subsequently employed to retrieve and resolve the correct KG URIs. PGMR significantly enhances query correctness (SQM) across various LLMs, datasets, and distribution shifts, while achieving the near-complete suppression of URI hallucinations. Critically, we demonstrate PGMR's superior safety and robustness: a retrieval confidence threshold enables PGMR to effectively refuse to answer queries that lack support, and the retriever proves highly resilient to memory noise, maintaining strong performance even when the non-parametric memory size is scaled up to 9 times with irrelevant, distracting entities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Bani-Harouni, Chantal Pellegrini, Paul Stangel, Ege \"Ozsoy, Kamilia Zaripova, Matthias Keicher, Nassir Navab</p>
<p>Abstract: A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach that allows to directly fine-tune LLMs to express calibrated confidence estimates alongside their answers to factual questions. Our method optimizes a reward based on the logarithmic scoring rule, explicitly penalizing both over- and under-confidence. This encourages the model to align its confidence estimates with the actual predictive accuracy. The optimal policy under our reward design would result in perfectly calibrated confidence expressions. Unlike prior approaches that decouple confidence estimation from response generation, our method integrates confidence calibration seamlessly into the generative process of the LLM. Empirically, we demonstrate that models trained with our approach exhibit substantially improved calibration and generalize to unseen tasks without further fine-tuning, suggesting the emergence of general confidence awareness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Yao, Qiuchi Li, Yazhou Zhang, Siyu Yang, Bohan Zhang, Prayag Tiwari, Jing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: While LLMs have demonstrated medical knowledge and conversational ability, their deployment in clinical practice raises new risks: patients may place greater trust in LLM-generated responses than in nurses' professional judgments, potentially intensifying nurse-patient conflicts. Such risks highlight the urgent need of evaluating whether LLMs align with the core nursing values upheld by human nurses. This work introduces the first benchmark for nursing value alignment, consisting of five core value dimensions distilled from international nursing codes: Altruism, Human Dignity, Integrity, Justice, and Professionalism. We define two-level tasks on the benchmark, considering the two characteristics of emerging nurse-patient conflicts. The Easy-Level dataset consists of 2,200 value-aligned and value-violating instances, which are collected through a five-month longitudinal field study across three hospitals of varying tiers; The Hard-Level dataset is comprised of 2,200 dialogue-based instances that embed contextual cues and subtle misleading signals, which increase adversarial complexity and better reflect the subjectivity and bias of narrators in the context of emerging nurse-patient conflicts. We evaluate a total of 23 SoTA LLMs on their ability to align with nursing values, and find that general LLMs outperform medical ones, and Justice is the hardest value dimension. As the first real-world benchmark for healthcare value alignment, NurValues provides novel insights into how LLMs navigate ethical challenges in clinician-patient interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Zhao, Hongbin Xie, Yuzhen Lei, Xuan Song, Zhuoran Shi, Lianxin Li, Shuangxue Liu, Linguo Xie, Haoran Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in executing complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thought effectively enhances reasoning capabilities by unlocking the potential of large models, while multi-agent systems provide more comprehensive solutions by integrating the collective intelligence of multiple agents. However, both approaches face significant limitations. Single-agent with chain-of-thought, due to the inherent complexity of designing cross-domain prompts, faces collaboration challenges. Meanwhile, multi-agent systems consume substantial tokens and inevitably dilute the primary problem, which is particularly problematic in business workflow tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Cochain, a collaboration prompting framework that effectively solves the business workflow collaboration problem by combining knowledge and prompts at a reduced cost. Specifically, we construct an integrated knowledge graph that incorporates knowledge from multiple stages. Furthermore, by maintaining and retrieving a prompts tree, we can obtain prompt information relevant to other stages of the business workflow. We perform extensive evaluations of Cochain across multiple datasets, demonstrating that Cochain outperforms all baselines in both prompt engineering and multi-agent LLMs. Additionally, expert evaluation results indicate that the use of a small model in combination with Cochain outperforms GPT-4.</p>

In this work, we introduce a suite of tasks and release TV-MMPC, a new annotated dataset, for multimodal conversation structure understanding. Our evaluation reveals that while all multimodal LLMs outperform our heuristic baseline, even the best-performing model we consider experiences a substantial drop in performance when character identities of the conversation are anonymized. Beyond evaluation, we carry out a sociolinguistic analysis of 350,842 utterances in TVQA. We find that while female characters initiate conversations at rates in proportion to their speaking time, they are 1.2 times more likely than men to be cast as an addressee or side-participant, and the presence of side-participants shifts the conversational register from personal to social.</p>

<p>Abstract: With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, current large language models (LLMs) support only a small subset. Prior research indicates LLMs can learn new languages for certain tasks without supervised data. We extend this investigation to speech recognition, investigating whether LLMs can learn unseen, low-resource languages through in-context learning (ICL). With experiments on four diverse endangered languages that LLMs have not been trained on, we find that providing more relevant text samples enhances performance in both language modelling and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. Furthermore, we show that the probability-based approach outperforms the traditional instruction-based approach in language learning. Lastly, we show ICL enables LLMs to achieve ASR performance that is comparable to or even surpasses dedicated language models trained specifically for these languages, while preserving the original capabilities of the LLMs. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anshun Asher Zheng, Junyi Jessy Li, David I. Beaver</p>
<p>Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes, adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on cooperativity. This leaves a gap in the systematic understanding of strategic communication in adversarial settings. To address this, we introduce SDA (Strategic Dialogue Assessment), a framework grounded in Gricean and game-theoretic pragmatics to assess strategic use of language. It adapts the ME Game jury function to make it empirically estimable for analyzing dialogue. Our approach incorporates two key adaptations: a commitment-based taxonomy of discourse moves, which provides a finer-grained account of strategic effects, and the use of estimable proxies grounded in Gricean maxims to operationalize abstract constructs such as credibility. Together, these adaptations build on discourse theory by treating discourse as the strategic management of commitments, enabling systematic evaluation of how conversational moves advance or undermine discourse goals. We further derive three interpretable metrics-Benefit at Turn (BAT), Penalty at Turn (PAT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBAT)-to quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present CPD (the Crooked Path Dataset), an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts, introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting harmful memes is crucial for safeguarding the integrity and harmony of online environments, yet existing detection methods are often resource-intensive, inflexible, and lacking explainability, limiting their applicability in assisting real-world web content moderation. We propose U-CoT+, a resource-efficient framework that prioritizes accessibility, flexibility and transparency in harmful meme detection by fully harnessing the capabilities of lightweight unimodal large language models (LLMs). Instead of directly prompting or fine-tuning large multimodal models (LMMs) as black-box classifiers, we avoid immediate reasoning over complex visual inputs but decouple meme content recognition from meme harmfulness analysis through a high-fidelity meme-to-text pipeline, which collaborates lightweight LMMs and LLMs to convert multimodal memes into natural language descriptions that preserve critical visual information, thus enabling text-only LLMs to "see" memes by "reading". Grounded in textual inputs, we further guide unimodal LLMs' reasoning under zero-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) prompting with targeted, interpretable, context-aware, and easily obtained human-crafted guidelines, thus providing accountable step-by-step rationales, while enabling flexible and efficient adaptation to diverse sociocultural criteria of harmfulness. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that U-CoT+ achieves performance comparable to resource-intensive baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and potential as a scalable, explainable, and low-resource solution to support harmful meme detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Curriculum learning-organizing training data from easy to hard-has improved efficiency across machine learning domains, yet remains underexplored for language model pretraining. We present the first systematic investigation of curriculum learning in LLM pretraining, with over 200 models trained on up to 100B tokens across three strategies: vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and interleaved curricula, guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and information-theoretic properties. We evaluate performance on eight benchmarks under three realistic scenarios: limited data, unlimited data, and continual training. Our experiments show that curriculum learning consistently accelerates convergence in early and mid-training phases,reducing training steps by $18-45\%$ to reach baseline performance. When applied as a warmup strategy before standard random sampling, curriculum learning yields sustained improvements up to $3.5\%$. We identify compression ratio, lexical diversity (MTLD), and readability (Flesch Reading Ease) as the most effective difficulty signals. Our findings demonstrate that data ordering-orthogonal to existing data selection methods-provides a practical mechanism for more efficient LLM pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhouqi Hua, Wenwei Zhang, Chengqi Lyu, Yuzhe Gu, Songyang Gao, Kuikun Liu, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and 18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1. The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine, instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers. This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of LLM reasoning from synthetic data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We examine, analyze, and compare four representative creativity measures--perplexity, LLM-as-a-Judge, the Creativity Index (CI; measuring n-gram overlap with web corpora), and syntactic templates (detecting repetition of common part-of-speech patterns)--across the diverse creative domains, such as creative writing, unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. For each domain, we compile datasets with human-aligned creative and uncreative examples and evaluate each metric's ability to discriminate between the two sets. Our analyses reveal limited consistency both across domains and metrics, as metrics that distinguish creativity in one domain fail in others (e.g., CI correctly distinguishes in creative writing but fails in problem-solving), and different metrics often disagree on the same data points (e.g., CI suggests one set to be more creative, while perplexity indicates the other set to be more creative.) We highlight key limitations, such as perplexity reflecting fluency rather than novelty; LLM-as-a-Judge producing inconsistent judgments under minor prompt variations and exhibiting bias towards particular labels; CI primarily measuring lexical diversity, with high sensitivity to implementation choices; and syntactic templates being ineffective in settings dominated by formulaic language. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human judgments of creativity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Chen, Jiabao Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical challenge for automated rule checking (ARC) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain. While large language models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning capabilities, their deployment in resource-constrained AEC environments is often impractical. Conversely, standard efficient models struggle with the significant domain gap. Although this gap can be mitigated by pre-training on large, humancurated corpora, such approaches are labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose ARCE (Augmented RoBERTa with Contextualized Elucidations), a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages LLMs to synthesize a task-oriented corpus, termed Cote, for incrementally pre-training smaller models. ARCE systematically explores the optimal strategy for knowledge transfer. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20% and outperforming both domain-specific baselines and fine-tuned LLMs. Crucially, our study reveals a less is more principle: simple, direct explanations prove significantly more effective for domain adaptation than complex, role-based rationales in the NER task, which tend to introduce semantic noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Mu, Zonghao Ying, Zhekui Fan, Zonglei Jing, Yaoyuan Zhang, Zhengmin Yu, Wenxin Zhang, Quanchen Zou, Xiangzheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix. Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts. Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjong Ok, Suho Yoo, Hyeonjun Kim, Jaeho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Even without directly hearing sounds, humans can effortlessly reason about auditory properties, such as pitch, loudness, or sound-source associations, drawing on auditory commonsense. In contrast, language models often lack this capability, limiting their effectiveness in multimodal interactions. As an initial step to address this gap, we present AuditoryBench++, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating auditory knowledge and reasoning in text-only settings. The benchmark encompasses tasks that range from basic auditory comparisons to contextually grounded reasoning, enabling fine-grained analysis of how models process and integrate auditory concepts. In addition, we introduce AIR-CoT, a novel auditory imagination reasoning method that generates and integrates auditory information during inference through span detection with special tokens and knowledge injection. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs and Multimodal LLMs demonstrate that AIR-CoT generally outperforms both the off-the-shelf models and those augmented with auditory knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqiao Liu, Xueyi Li, Hao Wang, Haoxuan Li, Zhichao Chen, Weiqi Luo, Zitao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant interest in extending their capabilities to multimodal scenarios, particularly for speech-to-speech conversational systems. However, existing multimodal models handling interleaved audio and text rely on autoregressive (AR) methods, overlooking that text depends on target-target relations whereas audio depends mainly on source-target relations. In this work, we propose Text-to-Talk (TtT), a unified audio-text framework that integrates AR text generation with non-autoregressive (NAR) audio diffusion in a single Transformer. By leveraging the any-order AR property of absorbing discrete diffusion, our approach provides a unified training objective for text and audio. To support this hybrid generation paradigm, we design a modality-aware attention mechanism that enforces causal decoding for text while allowing bidirectional modeling within audio spans, and further introduce three training strategies that reduce train-test discrepancies. During inference, TtT employs block-wise diffusion to synthesize audio in parallel while flexibly handling variable-length outputs. Comprehensive experiments on Audio-QA, ASR, AAC and speech-to-speech benchmarks show that TtT consistently surpasses strong AR and NAR baselines, with additional ablation and training-strategy analyses confirming the contribution of each component. We will open-source our models, data and code to facilitate future research in this direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaorui Shi, Yuxin Chen, Siyuan Wang, Sihang Li, Hengxing Cai, Qi Gu, Xiang Wang, An Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering, where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens. Existing works equip large language models with a memory buffer that is dynamically updated via a linear document scan, also known as the "memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it suffers from pruning of latent evidence, information loss through overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these challenges, we present ReMemR1, which integrates the mechanism of memory retrieval into the memory update process, enabling the agent to selectively callback historical memories for non-linear reasoning. To further strengthen training, we propose a multi-level reward design, which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate information degradation, improve supervision, and support complex multi-hop reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMemR1 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-context question answering while incurring negligible computational overhead, validating its ability to trade marginal cost for robust long-context reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Anugraha, Shou-Yi Hung, Zilu Tang, Annie En-Shiun Lee, Derry Tanti Wijaya, Genta Indra Winata</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data sources for building high-quality reward models, including support for reasoning in the target language. Our approach attains state-of-the-art performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mR3 in off-policy preference optimization and validate the quality of its reasoning traces and rubric-based evaluations through human studies with 20 annotators across 12 languages, where mR3 models' reasoning is preferred, including for extremely low-resource languages that are entirely unseen during training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Nagaraj, Sakshi Choudhary, Utkarsh Saxena, Deepak Ravikumar, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks and commonly relies on large, diverse corpora. However, small, high-quality subsets, known as coresets, can deliver comparable or superior results, though curating them remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse, sample-level signals like gradients, an approach that is computationally expensive and overlooks fine-grained features. To address this, we introduce TRIM (Token Relevance via Interpretable Multi-layer Attention), a forward-only, token-centric framework. Instead of using gradients, TRIM operates by matching underlying representational patterns identified via attention-based "fingerprints" from a handful of target samples. Such an approach makes TRIM highly efficient and uniquely sensitive to the structural features that define a task. Coresets selected by our method consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9% on downstream tasks and even surpass the performance of full-data fine-tuning in some settings. By avoiding expensive backward passes, TRIM achieves this at a fraction of the computational cost. These findings establish TRIM as a scalable and efficient alternative for building high-quality instruction-tuning datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanran Chen, Lynn Greschner, Roman Klinger, Michael Klenk, Steffen Eger</p>
<p>Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation in the context of fallacious argumentation.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09885">Closing the Data-Efficiency Gap Between Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Pan, Ely Hahami, Jingxuan Fan, Ziqian Xie, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often used in environments where facts evolve, yet factual knowledge updates via fine-tuning on unstructured text often suffers from 1) reliance on compute-heavy paraphrase augmentation and 2) the reversal curse. Recent studies show diffusion large language models (dLLMs) require fewer training samples to achieve lower loss in pre-training and are more resistant to the reversal curse, suggesting dLLMs may learn new knowledge more easily than autoregressive LLMs (arLLMs). We test this hypothesis in controlled knowledge fine-tuning experiments and find that while arLLMs rely on paraphrase augmentation to generalize knowledge text into question-answering (QA) capability, dLLMs do not require paraphrases to achieve high QA accuracy. To further investigate whether the demasking objective alone can induce such a knowledge injection advantage in dLLMs regardless of their diffusion denoising paradigm, we propose masked fine-tuning for arLLMs, which prompts an arLLM to reconstruct the original text given a masked version in context. The masked fine-tuning for arLLMs substantially improves the efficacy of knowledge injection, i.e. no paraphrase needed and resistant to the reversal curse, closing the gap between arLLMs and dLLMs. We also demonstrate that the same demasking objective improves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on math tasks over standard SFT, suggesting broader applicability of the demasking objective.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference \textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of $\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6 Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompts, but most automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods assume access to ground-truth references (e.g., labeled validation data) that are costly to obtain. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization based on pairwise preference feedback from an LLM judge. PDO casts prompt selection as a dueling-bandit problem and combines (i) Double Thompson Sampling to prioritize informative comparisons under a fixed judge budget, with (ii) top-performer guided mutation to expand the candidate pool while pruning weak prompts. Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently identifies stronger prompts than label-free baselines, while offering favorable quality--cost trade-offs under constrained comparison budgets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of 1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8 creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness, factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy, while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from 18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale, with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants. Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g., creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather than direct classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasser Hamidullah, Koel Dutta Chowdhury, Yusser Al Ghussin, Shakib Yazdani, Cennet Oguz, Josef van Genabith, Cristina Espa\~na-Bonet</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks (PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together, our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust hallucination detection in multimodal generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this. We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information is beneficial for existing fact-checking systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gyeom Hwangbo, Hyungjoo Chae, Minseok Kang, Hyeonjong Ju, Soohyun Oh, Jinyoung Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions, advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics, degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment. This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods. Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmytro Vitel, Anshuman Chhabra</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM) decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhimin Qiu, Di Wu, Feng Liu, Yuxiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Samuel, Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper combines autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without any architectural modifications, resulting in flexible language models that outperform single-objective models. Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal balance between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal balance is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueru Yan, Tuc Nguyen, Bo Su, Melissa Lieffers, Thai Le</p>
<p>Abstract: While academic research typically treats Large Language Models (LLM) as generic text generators, they are distinct commercial products with unique interfaces and capabilities that fundamentally shape user behavior. Current datasets obscure this reality by collecting text-only data through uniform interfaces that fail to capture authentic chatbot usage. To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale corpus of 142,808 conversations (660,293 turns) sourced directly from publicly shared URLs on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, and Claude. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances, such as citations and thinking traces, across a diverse collection covering 101 languages and the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. To illustrate the dataset's breadth, we present three case studies: a completeness analysis of intent satisfaction, a citation study of model grounding, and a temporal analysis of engagement rhythms. This work provides the community with a vital and timely resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions in the wild. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging Face.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingyang Kelvin Liu, Ziyu Patrick Chen, David P. Woodruff</p>
<p>Abstract: Current autoregressive language models couple high-level reasoning and low-level token generation into a single sequential process, making the reasoning trajectory vulnerable to compounding expression errors. We propose JEPA-Reasoner, a novel architectural paradigm that decouples these tasks using a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) for pure latent-space reasoning and a separate Talker module for linguistic reconstruction. By isolating the reasoning engine from the discrete token-sampling process, our architecture enables: (1) Error Containment, where token-level failures cannot propagate into the latent reasoning chain; (2) Continuous Guidance, providing the generator with access to the entire lossless reasoning trajectory; and (3) Representation of Uncertainty, allowing the model to maintain multiple hypotheses via mixed latent vectors. Controlled experiments on synthetic and natural language tasks demonstrate that this decoupling enables a 0.9B model to achieve a 149.5\% improvement in 8-shot GSM8K accuracy over a coupled Transformer baseline trained on identical data. This work shifts the focus from scaling coupled models to investigating decoupled architectures as a more robust foundation for complex reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-layer reuse of early attention projections can improve optimization and data efficiency, but it creates a structural conflict: the first layer must simultaneously act as a stable, reusable anchor for all deeper layers and as an effective computational block. We demonstrate that this tension constrains the performance of internal-anchor designs. We propose ExoFormer, which resolves the conflict by learning exogenous anchor projections outside the sequential layer stack. We introduce a unified normalized mixing framework that mixes queries, keys, values, and gate logits using learnable coefficients (exploring coefficient granularities: elementwise, headwise, and scalar), and we show that normalizing anchor sources is key to stable reuse. ExoFormer variants consistently outperform their internal-anchor counterparts, and the dynamic variant yields 1.5x downstream accuracy points while matching validation loss using 1.5x fewer tokens than Gated Attention. We explain this efficacy via an Offloading Hypothesis: external anchors preserve essential token identity, allowing layers to specialize exclusively in feature transformation. We release code and models to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziang Cui, Mengran Yu, Tianjiao Li, Chenyu Shi, Yingxuan Shi, Lusheng Zhang, Hongwei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable strides in multilingual translation but are hindered by a systemic cross-lingual verbosity bias, rendering them unsuitable for strict time-constrained tasks like subtitling and dubbing. Current prompt-engineering approaches struggle to resolve this conflict between semantic fidelity and rigid temporal feasibility. To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively "tames" the output length. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control that respects linguistic density hierarchies without compromising semantic adequacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingxuan Li, Jeonghwan Kim, Cheng Qian, Xiusi Chen, Eitan Anzenberg, Niran Kundapur, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Overlapping calendar invitations force busy professionals to repeatedly decide which meetings to attend, reschedule, or decline. We refer to this preference-driven decision process as calendar conflict resolution. Automating this decision process is crucial yet challenging. Scheduling logistics can drain hours, and human delegation often fails at scale, which motivates us to ask: Can we trust large language models (LLMs) or language agents to manage time? To enable a systematic study of this question, we introduce CalConflictBench, a benchmark for long-horizon calendar conflict resolution. In CalConflictBench, conflicts are presented to agents round-by-round over a calendar year, requiring them to infer and adapt to user preferences progressively. Our experiments show that current LLM agents perform poorly with high error rates, e.g., Qwen-3-30B-Think has an average error rate of 35%. To address this gap, we propose PEARL, a reinforcement-learning framework that (i) augments the language agent with an external preference memory that stores and updates inferred strategies (e.g., attendee priorities, topic importance, time/location preferences), and (ii) optimizes the agent with round-wise rewards that directly supervise decision correctness, ranking quality, and memory usage across rounds. Experiments on CalConflictBench show that PEARL achieves an error reduction rate of 0.76 and a 55% improvement in average error rate compared to the strongest baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> V\'ictor Yeste, Paolo Rosso</p>
<p>Abstract: We study sentence-level detection of the 19 human values in the refined Schwartz continuum in about 74k English sentences from news and political manifestos (ValueEval'24 corpus). Each sentence is annotated with value presence, yielding a binary moral-presence label and a 19-way multi-label task under severe class imbalance. First, we show that moral presence is learnable from single sentences: a DeBERTa-base classifier attains positive-class F1 = 0.74 with calibrated thresholds. Second, we compare direct multi-label value detectors with presence-gated hierarchies under a single 8 GB GPU budget. Under matched compute, presence gating does not improve over direct prediction, indicating that gate recall becomes a bottleneck. Third, we investigate lightweight auxiliary signals - short-range context, LIWC-22 and moral lexica, and topic features - and small ensembles. Our best supervised configuration, a soft-voting ensemble of DeBERTa-based models enriched with such signals, reaches macro-F1 = 0.332 on the 19 values, improving over the best previous English-only baseline on this corpus (macro-F1 $\approx$ 0.28). We additionally benchmark 7-9B instruction-tuned LLMs (Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B) in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups, and find that they lag behind the supervised ensemble under the same hardware constraint. Overall, our results provide empirical guidance for building compute-efficient, value-aware NLP models under realistic GPU budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanathai Lertpetchpun, Yoonjeong Lee, Thanapat Trachu, Jihwan Lee, Tiantian Feng, Dani Byrd, Shrikanth Narayanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Many spoken languages, including English, exhibit wide variation in dialects and accents, making accent control an important capability for flexible text-to-speech (TTS) models. Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangmitra Madhusudan, Trush Shashank More, Steph Buongiorno, Renata Dividino, Jad Kabbara, Ali Emami</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing cultural commonsense benchmarks treat nations as monolithic, assuming uniform practices within national boundaries. But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the "default" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West. Beyond India, our methodology provides a generalizable framework for evaluating cultural commonsense in any culturally heterogeneous nation, from question design grounded in anthropological taxonomy, to regional data collection, to bias measurement.</p>

A. Clarke, Hu Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to legal domain-specific tasks, evaluating their ability to perform legal work in real-world settings has become essential. However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zecheng Tang, Quantong Qiu, Yi Yang, Zhiyi Hong, Haiya Xiang, Kebin Liu, Qingqing Dang, Juntao Li, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms poses a significant scalability bottleneck for large language models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios. While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes. Within only 12 hours of training on 8xA800 GPUs, our method enables models to achieve both strong performance and efficient inference. Experiments across three long-context benchmarks on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingsen Ma, Dianyun Wang, Yaoye Wang, Lechen Ning, Sujie Zhu, Xiaohang Zhang, Jiaming Lyu, Linhao Ren, Zhenbo Xu, Zhaofeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to multi-document and long-form inputs, yet long-context inference remains memory- and noise-inefficient. Key-value (KV) caching scales linearly with context length, while external retrieval methods often return lexically similar but causally irrelevant passages.
  We present S3-Attention, a memory-first inference-time framework that treats long-context processing as attention-aligned endogenous retrieval. S3-Attention decodes transient key and query projections into top-k sparse feature identifiers using lightweight sparse autoencoders, and constructs a CPU-based inverted index mapping features to token positions or spans during a single streaming scan. This design allows the KV cache to be discarded entirely and bounds GPU memory usage by the scan chunk size.
  At generation time, feature co-activation is used to retrieve compact evidence spans, optionally fused with BM25 for exact lexical matching. Under a unified LongBench evaluation protocol with fixed prompting, decoding, and matched token budgets, S3-Hybrid closely matches full-context inference across multiple model families and improves robustness in several information-dense settings. We also report an engineering limitation of the current prototype, which incurs higher wall-clock latency than optimized full-KV baselines, motivating future kernel-level optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oren Sultan, Jordi Armengol-Estape, Pascal Kesseli, Julien Vanegue, Dafna Shahaf, Yossi Adi, Peter O'Hearn</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaehyun Um, KyuHwan Yeom, Haerim Yang, Minyoung Choi, Hyeongjun Yang, Kyong-Ho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current stance detection research typically relies on predicting stance based on given targets and text. However, in real-world social media scenarios, targets are neither predefined nor static but rather complex and dynamic. To address this challenge, we propose a novel task: zero-shot stance detection in the wild with Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation (DGTA), which aims to automatically identify multiple target-stance pairs from text without prior target knowledge. We construct a Chinese social media stance detection dataset and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. We explore both integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies for large language models (LLMs) and evaluate various baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance on this task: the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B attains the highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martijn Bartelds, Ananjan Nandi, Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Dan Jurafsky, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Karen Livescu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern deep learning models often achieve high overall performance, but consistently fail on specific subgroups. Group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) addresses this problem by minimizing the worst-group loss, but it fails when group losses misrepresent performance differences between groups. This is common in domains like speech, where the widely used connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss not only scales with input length but also varies with linguistic and acoustic properties, leading to spurious differences between group losses. We present CTC-DRO, which addresses the shortcomings of the group DRO objective by smoothing the group weight update to prevent overemphasis on consistently high-loss groups, while using input length-matched batching to mitigate CTC's scaling issues. We evaluate CTC-DRO on the task of multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) across five language sets from the diverse ML-SUPERB 2.0 benchmark. CTC-DRO consistently outperforms group DRO and CTC-based baseline models, reducing the worst-language error by up to 47.1% and the average error by up to 32.9%. CTC-DRO can be applied to ASR with minimal computational costs, and, while motivated by multilingual ASR, offers the potential for reducing group disparities in other domains with similar challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilad Yehudai, Noah Amsel, Joan Bruna</p>
<p>Abstract: It is well understood that different neural network architectures are suited to different tasks, but is there always a single best architecture for a given task? We compare the expressive power of transformers, RNNs, and transformers with chain of thought tokens on a simple and natural class of tasks we term Compositional Reasoning Questions (CRQ). This family captures multi-step problems with tree-like compositional structure, such as evaluating Boolean formulas. We prove that under standard hardness assumptions, \emph{none} of these three architectures is capable of solving CRQs unless some hyperparameter (depth, embedding dimension, and number of chain of thought tokens, respectively) grows with the size of the input. We then provide constructions for solving CRQs with each architecture. For transformers, our construction uses depth that is logarithmic in the problem size. For RNNs, logarithmic embedding dimension is necessary and sufficient, so long as the inputs are provided in a certain order. For transformers with chain of thought, our construction uses $n$ CoT tokens for input size $n$. These results show that, while CRQs are inherently hard, there are several different ways for language models to overcome this hardness. Even for a single class of problems, each architecture has strengths and weaknesses, and none is strictly better than the others.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilad Yehudai, Clayton Sanford, Maya Bechler-Speicher, Orr Fischer, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Amir Globerson</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized the field of machine learning. In particular, they can be used to solve complex algorithmic problems, including graph-based tasks. In such algorithmic tasks a key question is what is the minimal size of a transformer that can implement the task. Recent work has begun to explore this problem for graph-based tasks, showing that for sub-linear embedding dimension (i.e., model width) logarithmic depth suffices. However, an open question, which we address here, is what happens if width is allowed to grow linearly, while depth is kept fixed. Here we analyze this setting, and provide the surprising result that with linear width, constant depth suffices for solving a host of graph-based problems. This suggests that a moderate increase in width can allow much shallower models, which are advantageous in terms of inference and train time. For other problems, we show that quadratic width is required. Our results demonstrate the complex and intriguing landscape of transformer implementations of graph-based algorithms. We empirically investigate these trade-offs between the relative powers of depth and width and find tasks where wider models have the same accuracy as deep models, while having much faster train and inference time due to parallelizable hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Hayashi, Shintaro Ozaki, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are being deployed in real-world settings that require visual inference. As capabilities improve, applications in navigation, education, and accessibility are becoming practical. These settings require accommodation of perceptual variation rather than assuming a uniform visual experience. Color perception illustrates this requirement: it is central to visual understanding yet varies across individuals due to Color Vision Deficiencies, an aspect largely ignored in multimodal AI. In this work, we examine whether LVLMs can account for variation in color perception using the Ishihara Test. We evaluate model behavior through generation, confidence, and internal representation, using Ishihara plates as controlled stimuli that expose perceptual differences. Although models possess factual knowledge about color vision deficiencies and can describe the test, they fail to reproduce the perceptual outcomes experienced by affected individuals and instead default to normative color perception. These results indicate that current systems lack mechanisms for representing alternative perceptual experiences, raising concerns for accessibility and inclusive deployment in multimodal settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Lisondra, Beno Benhabib, Goldie Nejat</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and Vision-Language-Action Models, have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interaction, mobile service robots can achieve more flexible understanding, adaptive behavior, and robust task execution in dynamic real-world environments. Despite this progress, embodied AI for mobile service robots continues to face fundamental challenges related to the translation of natural language instructions into executable robot actions, multimodal perception in human-centered environments, uncertainty estimation for safe decision-making, and computational constraints for real-time onboard deployment. In this paper, we present the first systematic review focused specifically on the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics. We analyze how recent advances in foundation models address these core challenges through language-conditioned control, multimodal sensor fusion, uncertainty-aware reasoning, and efficient model scaling. We further examine real-world applications in domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation, highlighting how foundation models enable context-aware, socially responsive, and generalizable robot behaviors. Beyond technical considerations, we discuss ethical, societal, and human-interaction implications associated with deploying foundation model-enabled service robots in human environments. Finally, we outline future research directions emphasizing reliability and lifelong adaptation, privacy-aware and resource-constrained deployment, and governance and human-in-the-loop frameworks required for safe, scalable, and trustworthy mobile service robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew C. Kelley</p>
<p>Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. Having confidence intervals provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the boundary placement, facilitating tasks like finding boundaries that should be reviewed. As a bonus, on the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight overall improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals can be emitted during the alignment process as JSON files and a main table for programmatic and statistical analysis. For familiarity, they are also output as Praat TextGrids using a point tier to represent the intervals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Chen, Yue Guo, Zhaochen Su, Yafu Li, Yulun Wu, Jiacheng Chen, Jiayu Chen, Weijie Wang, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology, exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning. To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in scientific and engineering domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair, generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity, has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 660 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess 43 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and conduct multiple ablation studies to analyze key issues, including evaluation metrics, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo-Cheng Chiu, Jen-Jee Chen, Yu-Chee Tseng, Feng-Chi Chen, An-Zi Yen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain, enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with LLM-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Long Lu, Jiajun Song, Chunhui Zhang, Wei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs) aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent (GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals. We conclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of more human-aligned agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practically infeasible. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hakaze Cho, Haolin Yang, Gouki Minegishi, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Twist, Jie M. Zhang, Mark Harman, Helen Yannakoudakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting. Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate seven diverse LLMs across two hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to 99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Xuan, Xuechen Liu, Wenxin Zhang, Yi-Cheng Lin, Xiaojian Lin, Tomi Kinnunen</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic, in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable parameters and notable performance gains.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Chen, Zhixin Ma, Yongqi Li, Yupeng Hu, Yinwei Wei, Wenjie Li, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilitate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M$^3$CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45\% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: China's marriage registrations have declined substantially, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. This study examined sentiment and moral elements underlying 219,358 marriage-related posts from Weibo and Xiaohongshu using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral elements (autonomy, community, divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo leaned toward positive sentiment, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral elements were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking autonomy and community were predominantly negative, whereas divinity-framed posts tended toward positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations contribute to negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China, offering insights for culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference paradigm that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs can successfully process inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of vanilla frontier LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks while having comparable cost. At a small scale, we post-train the first natively recursive language model. Our model, RLM-Qwen3-8B, outperforms the underlying Qwen3-8B model by $28.3\%$ on average and even approaches the quality of vanilla GPT-5 on three long-context tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Cheng, Fengzhuo Zhang, Yunlong Hou, Cunxiao Du, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Aixin Sun, Zhuoran Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $\Delta$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $\Delta$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Loi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models increasingly function as artificial reasoners: they evaluate arguments, assign credibility, and express confidence. Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.</p>

To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Song, Haoyu Sun, Jiawei Gu, Linjie Li, Luxin Xu, Ranjay Krishna, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: When humans face problems beyond their immediate capabilities, they rely on tools, providing a promising paradigm for improving visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw.</p>
