<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajat Chawla, Arkajit Datta, Tushar Verma, Adarsh Jha, Anmol Gautam, Ayush Vatsal, Sukrit Chaterjee, Mukunda NS, Ishaan Bhola</p>
<p>Abstract: Lately, researchers in artificial intelligence have been really interested in how language and vision come together, giving rise to the development of multimodal models that aim to seamlessly integrate textual and visual information. Multimodal models, an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable capabilities in addressing a diverse array of tasks, ranging from image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) to visual grounding. While these models have showcased significant advancements, challenges persist in accurately interpreting images and answering the question, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the multimodal capabilities of existing models. In response to the limitations observed in current Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our proposed model Veagle, incorporates a unique mechanism inspired by the successes and insights of previous works. Veagle leverages a dynamic mechanism to project encoded visual information directly into the language model. This dynamic approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of intricate details present in visual contexts. To validate the effectiveness of Veagle, we conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, emphasizing tasks such as visual question answering and image understanding. Our results indicate a improvement of 5-6 \% in performance, with Veagle outperforming existing models by a notable margin. The outcomes underscore the model's versatility and applicability beyond traditional benchmarks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08776">Leveraging Chat-Based Large Vision Language Models for Multimodal Out-Of-Context Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatma Shalabi, Hichem Felouat, Huy H. Nguyen, Isao Echizen</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-context (OOC) detection is a challenging task involving identifying images and texts that are irrelevant to the context in which they are presented. Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are effective at various tasks, including image classification and text generation. However, the extent of their proficiency in multimodal OOC detection tasks is unclear. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LVLMs to detect multimodal OOC and show that these models cannot achieve high accuracy on OOC detection tasks without fine-tuning. However, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LVLMs on multimodal OOC datasets can further improve their OOC detection accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LVLMs on OOC detection tasks, we fine-tune MiniGPT-4 on the NewsCLIPpings dataset, a large dataset of multimodal OOC. Our results show that fine-tuning MiniGPT-4 on the NewsCLIPpings dataset significantly improves the OOC detection accuracy in this dataset. This suggests that fine-tuning can significantly improve the performance of LVLMs on OOC detection tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuang Wang, Zhengping Li, Yuwen Hao, Lijun Wang, Xiaoxue Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to solve the problems of long training time, large consumption of computing resources and huge parameter amount of GAN network in image generation, this paper proposes an improved GAN network model, which is named Faster Projected GAN, based on Projected GAN. The proposed network is mainly focuses on the improvement of generator of Projected GAN. By introducing depth separable convolution (DSC), the number of parameters of the Projected GAN is reduced, the training speed is accelerated, and memory is saved. Experimental results show that on ffhq-1k, art-painting, Landscape and other few-shot image datasets, a 20% speed increase and a 15% memory saving are achieved. At the same time, FID loss is less or no loss, and the amount of model parameters is better controlled. At the same time, significant training speed improvement has been achieved in the small sample image generation task of special scenes such as earthquake scenes with few public datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabio Merizzi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this study we introduce a new technique for the generation of terrain maps, exploiting a combination of procedural generation and Neural Style Transfer. We consider our approach to be a viable alternative to competing generative models, with our technique achieving greater versatility, lower hardware requirements and greater integration in the creative process of designers and developers. Our method involves generating procedural noise maps using either multi-layered smoothed Gaussian noise or the Perlin algorithm. We then employ an enhanced Neural Style transfer technique, drawing style from real-world height maps. This fusion of algorithmic generation and neural processing holds the potential to produce terrains that are not only diverse but also closely aligned with the morphological characteristics of real-world landscapes, with our process yielding consistent terrain structures with low computational cost and offering the capability to create customized maps. Numerical evaluations further validate our model's enhanced ability to accurately replicate terrain morphology, surpassing traditional procedural methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lai Wei, Shanshan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiview subspace clustering (MVSC) has attracted an increasing amount of attention in recent years. Most existing MVSC methods first collect complementary information from different views and consequently derive a consensus reconstruction coefficient matrix to indicate the subspace structure of a multi-view data set. In this paper, we initially assume the existence of a consensus reconstruction coefficient matrix and then use it to build a consensus graph filter. In each view, the filter is employed for smoothing the data and designing a regularizer for the reconstruction coefficient matrix. Finally, the obtained reconstruction coefficient matrices from different views are used to create constraints for the consensus reconstruction coefficient matrix. Therefore, in the proposed method, the consensus reconstruction coefficient matrix, the consensus graph filter, and the reconstruction coefficient matrices from different views are interdependent. We provide an optimization algorithm to obtain their optimal values. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view data sets demonstrate that our approach outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: With Artificial Intelligence (AI) influencing the decision-making process of sensitive applications such as Face Verification, it is fundamental to ensure the transparency, fairness, and accountability of decisions. Although Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques exist to clarify AI decisions, it is equally important to provide interpretability of these decisions to humans. In this paper, we present an approach to combine computer and human vision to increase the explanation's interpretability of a face verification algorithm. In particular, we are inspired by the human perceptual process to understand how machines perceive face's human-semantic areas during face comparison tasks. We use Mediapipe, which provides a segmentation technique that identifies distinct human-semantic facial regions, enabling the machine's perception analysis. Additionally, we adapted two model-agnostic algorithms to provide human-interpretable insights into the decision-making processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heath Smith, James Seekings, Mohammadreza Mohammadi, Ramtin Zand</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper focuses on real-time facial expression recognition (FER) systems as an important component in various real-world applications such as social robotics. We investigate two hardware options for the deployment of FER machine learning (ML) models at the edge: neuromorphic hardware versus edge AI accelerators. Our study includes exhaustive experiments providing comparative analyses between the Intel Loihi neuromorphic processor and four distinct edge platforms: Raspberry Pi-4, Intel Neural Compute Stick (NSC), Jetson Nano, and Coral TPU. The results obtained show that Loihi can achieve approximately two orders of magnitude reduction in power dissipation and one order of magnitude energy savings compared to Coral TPU which happens to be the least power-intensive and energy-consuming edge AI accelerator. These reductions in power and energy are achieved while the neuromorphic solution maintains a comparable level of accuracy with the edge accelerators, all within the real-time latency requirements.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08793">Neural Loss Function Evolution for Large-Scale Image Classifier Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Morgan, Dean Hougen</p>
<p>Abstract: For classification, neural networks typically learn by minimizing cross-entropy, but are evaluated and compared using accuracy. This disparity suggests neural loss function search (NLFS), the search for a drop-in replacement loss function of cross-entropy for neural networks. We apply NLFS to image classifier convolutional neural networks. We propose a new search space for NLFS that encourages more diverse loss functions to be explored, and a surrogate function that accurately transfers to large-scale convolutional neural networks. We search the space using regularized evolution, a mutation-only aging genetic algorithm. After evolution and a proposed loss function elimination protocol, we transferred the final loss functions across multiple architectures, datasets, and image augmentation techniques to assess generalization. In the end, we discovered three new loss functions, called NeuroLoss1, NeuroLoss2, and NeuroLoss3 that were able to outperform cross-entropy in terms of a higher mean test accuracy as a simple drop-in replacement loss function across the majority of experiments.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08801">CoBra: Complementary Branch Fusing Class and Semantic Knowledge for Robust Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Woojung Han, Seil Kang, Kyobin Choo, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging semantically precise pseudo masks derived from image-level class knowledge for segmentation, namely image-level Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), still remains challenging. While Class Activation Maps (CAMs) using CNNs have steadily been contributing to the success of WSSS, the resulting activation maps often narrowly focus on class-specific parts (e.g., only face of human). On the other hand, recent works based on vision transformers (ViT) have shown promising results based on their self-attention mechanism to capture the semantic parts but fail in capturing complete class-specific details (e.g., entire body parts of human but also with a dog nearby). In this work, we propose Complementary Branch (CoBra), a novel dual branch framework consisting of two distinct architectures which provide valuable complementary knowledge of class (from CNN) and semantic (from ViT) to each branch. In particular, we learn Class-Aware Projection (CAP) for the CNN branch and Semantic-Aware Projection (SAP) for the ViT branch to explicitly fuse their complementary knowledge and facilitate a new type of extra patch-level supervision. Our model, through CoBra, fuses CNN and ViT's complementary outputs to create robust pseudo masks that integrate both class and semantic information effectively. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively investigate how CNN and ViT complement each other on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, showing a state-of-the-art WSSS result. This includes not only the masks generated by our model, but also the segmentation results derived from utilizing these masks as pseudo labels.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08806">Adversarially Robust Deepfake Detection via Adversarial Feature Similarity Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarwar Khan</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfake technology has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital content, necessitating the development of effective detection methods. However, the widespread availability of deepfakes has given rise to a new challenge in the form of adversarial attacks. Adversaries can manipulate deepfake videos with small, imperceptible perturbations that can deceive the detection models into producing incorrect outputs. To tackle this critical issue, we introduce Adversarial Feature Similarity Learning (AFSL), which integrates three fundamental deep feature learning paradigms. By optimizing the similarity between samples and weight vectors, our approach aims to distinguish between real and fake instances. Additionally, we aim to maximize the similarity between both adversarially perturbed examples and unperturbed examples, regardless of their real or fake nature. Moreover, we introduce a regularization technique that maximizes the dissimilarity between real and fake samples, ensuring a clear separation between these two categories. With extensive experiments on popular deepfake datasets, including FaceForensics++, FaceShifter, and DeeperForensics, the proposed method outperforms other standard adversarial training-based defense methods significantly. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach to protecting deepfake detectors from adversarial attacks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08821">Effective Gradient Sample Size via Variation Estimation for Accelerating Sharpness aware Minimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Deng, Junbiao Pang, Baochang Zhang, Tian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has been proposed recently to improve model generalization ability. However, SAM calculates the gradient twice in each optimization step, thereby doubling the computation costs compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient sampling method to significantly accelerate SAM. Concretely, we discover that the gradient of SAM is a combination of the gradient of SGD and the Projection of the Second-order gradient matrix onto the First-order gradient (PSF). PSF exhibits a gradually increasing frequency of change during the training process. To leverage this observation, we propose an adaptive sampling method based on the variation of PSF, and we reuse the sampled PSF for non-sampling iterations. Extensive empirical results illustrate that the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM on diverse network architectures.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08833">TINA: Think, Interaction, and Action Framework for Zero-Shot Vision Language Navigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dingbang Li, Wenzhou Chen, Xin Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot navigation is a critical challenge in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, where the ability to adapt to unfamiliar instructions and to act in unknown environments is essential. Existing supervised learning-based models, trained using annotated data through reinforcement learning, exhibit limitations in generalization capabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their extensive knowledge and emergent reasoning abilities, present a potential pathway for achieving zero-shot navigation. This paper presents a VLN agent based on LLMs, exploring approaches to the zero-shot navigation problem. To compensate for the shortcomings of LLMs in environmental perception, we propose the Thinking, Interacting, and Action (TINA) framework. TINA enables the agent to scrutinize perceptual information and autonomously query key clues within the environment through an introduced question-answering module, thereby aligning instructions with specific perceptual data. The navigation agent's perceptual abilities are enhanced through the TINA framework, while the explicit thought and query processes also improve the navigational procedure's explainability and transparency. We evaluate the performance of our method on the Room-to-Room dataset. The experiment results indicate that our approach improves the navigation performance of LLM-based agents. Our approach also outperformed some supervised learning-based methods, highlighting its efficacy in zero-shot navigation.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08840">NoiseDiffusion: Correcting Noise for Image Interpolation with Diffusion Models beyond Spherical Linear Interpolation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> PengFei Zheng, Yonggang Zhang, Zhen Fang, Tongliang Liu, Defu Lian, Bo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Image interpolation based on diffusion models is promising in creating fresh and interesting images. Advanced interpolation methods mainly focus on spherical linear interpolation, where images are encoded into the noise space and then interpolated for denoising to images. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively interpolating natural images (not generated by diffusion models), thereby restricting their practical applicability. Our experimental investigations reveal that these challenges stem from the invalidity of the encoding noise, which may no longer obey the expected noise distribution, e.g., a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach to correct noise for image interpolation, NoiseDiffusion. Specifically, NoiseDiffusion approaches the invalid noise to the expected distribution by introducing subtle Gaussian noise and introduces a constraint to suppress noise with extreme values. In this context, promoting noise validity contributes to mitigating image artifacts, but the constraint and introduced exogenous noise typically lead to a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., loss of original image information. Hence, NoiseDiffusion performs interpolation within the noisy image space and injects raw images into these noisy counterparts to address the challenge of information loss. Consequently, NoiseDiffusion enables us to interpolate natural images without causing artifacts or information loss, thus achieving the best interpolation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minbin Huang, Yanxin Long, Xinchi Deng, Ruihang Chu, Jiangfeng Xiong, Xiaodan Liang, Hong Cheng, Qinglin Lu, Wei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have significantly advanced in recent years. However, effective interaction with these models is challenging for average users due to the need for specialized prompt engineering knowledge and the inability to perform multi-turn image generation, hindering a dynamic and iterative creation process. Recent attempts have tried to equip Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with T2I models to bring the user's natural language instructions into reality. Hence, the output modality of MLLMs is extended, and the multi-turn generation quality of T2I models is enhanced thanks to the strong multi-modal comprehension ability of MLLMs. However, many of these works face challenges in identifying correct output modalities and generating coherent images accordingly as the number of output modalities increases and the conversations go deeper. Therefore, we propose DialogGen, an effective pipeline to align off-the-shelf MLLMs and T2I models to build a Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System (MIDS) for multi-turn Text-to-Image generation. It is composed of drawing prompt alignment, careful training data curation, and error correction. Moreover, as the field of MIDS flourishes, comprehensive benchmarks are urgently needed to evaluate MIDS fairly in terms of output modality correctness and multi-modal output coherence. To address this issue, we introduce the Multi-modal Dialogue Benchmark (DialogBen), a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to assess the ability of MLLMs to generate accurate and coherent multi-modal content that supports image editing. It contains two evaluation metrics to measure the model's ability to switch modalities and the coherence of the output images. Our extensive experiments on DialogBen and user study demonstrate the effectiveness of DialogGen compared with other State-of-the-Art models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Helin Cao, Sven Behnke</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SLCF-Net, a novel approach for the Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) task that sequentially fuses LiDAR and camera data. It jointly estimates missing geometry and semantics in a scene from sequences of RGB images and sparse LiDAR measurements. The images are semantically segmented by a pre-trained 2D U-Net and a dense depth prior is estimated from a depth-conditioned pipeline fueled by Depth Anything. To associate the 2D image features with the 3D scene volume, we introduce Gaussian-decay Depth-prior Projection (GDP). This module projects the 2D features into the 3D volume along the line of sight with a Gaussian-decay function, centered around the depth prior. Volumetric semantics is computed by a 3D U-Net. We propagate the hidden 3D U-Net state using the sensor motion and design a novel loss to ensure temporal consistency. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset and compare it with leading SSC approaches. The SLCF-Net excels in all SSC metrics and shows great temporal consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Chen, Shunan Zhang, Eric Z. Chen, Yikang Liu, Lin Zhao, Terrence Chen, Shanhui Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, data diversity and volume play a pivotal role in model development. However, training a robust deep learning model often faces challenges due to data privacy, regulations, and the difficulty of sharing data between different locations, especially for medical applications. To address this, we developed a method called the Federated Data Model (FDM). This method uses diffusion models to learn the characteristics of data at one site and then creates synthetic data that can be used at another site without sharing the actual data. We tested this approach with a medical image segmentation task, focusing on cardiac magnetic resonance images from different hospitals. Our results show that models trained with this method perform well both on the data they were originally trained on and on data from other sites. This approach offers a promising way to train accurate and privacy-respecting AI models across different locations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yatian Pang, Tanghui Jia, Yujun Shi, Zhenyu Tang, Junwu Zhang, Xinhua Cheng, Xing Zhou, Francis E. H. Tay, Li Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Envision3D, a novel method for efficiently generating high-quality 3D content from a single image. Recent methods that extract 3D content from multi-view images generated by diffusion models show great potential. However, it is still challenging for diffusion models to generate dense multi-view consistent images, which is crucial for the quality of 3D content extraction. To address this issue, we propose a novel cascade diffusion framework, which decomposes the challenging dense views generation task into two tractable stages, namely anchor views generation and anchor views interpolation. In the first stage, we train the image diffusion model to generate global consistent anchor views conditioning on image-normal pairs. Subsequently, leveraging our video diffusion model fine-tuned on consecutive multi-view images, we conduct interpolation on the previous anchor views to generate extra dense views. This framework yields dense, multi-view consistent images, providing comprehensive 3D information. To further enhance the overall generation quality, we introduce a coarse-to-fine sampling strategy for the reconstruction algorithm to robustly extract textured meshes from the generated dense images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of generating high-quality 3D content in terms of texture and geometry, surpassing previous image-to-3D baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In our research we test data and models for the recognition of housing quality in the city of Amsterdam from ground-level and aerial imagery. For ground-level images we compare Google StreetView (GSV) to Flickr images. Our results show that GSV predicts the most accurate building quality scores, approximately 30% better than using only aerial images. However, we find that through careful filtering and by using the right pre-trained model, Flickr image features combined with aerial image features are able to halve the performance gap to GSV features from 30% to 15%. Our results indicate that there are viable alternatives to GSV for liveability factor prediction, which is encouraging as GSV images are more difficult to acquire and not always available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving stands as a pivotal domain in computer vision, shaping the future of transportation. Within this paradigm, the backbone of the system plays a crucial role in interpreting the complex environment. However, a notable challenge has been the loss of clear supervision when it comes to Bird's Eye View elements.

We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset and showcase significant and consistent improvements over the SOTA. Specifically, CLIP-BEVFormer achieves an impressive 8.5\% and 9.2\% enhancement in terms of NDS and mAP, respectively, over the previous best BEV model on the 3D object detection task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giuseppe Cartella, Vittorio Cuculo, Marcella Cornia, Rita Cucchiara</p>
<p>Abstract: Creating high-quality and realistic images is now possible thanks to the impressive advancements in image generation. A description in natural language of your desired output is all you need to obtain breathtaking results. However, as the use of generative models grows, so do concerns about the propagation of malicious content and misinformation. Consequently, the research community is actively working on the development of novel fake detection techniques, primarily focusing on low-level features and possible fingerprints left by generative models during the image generation process. In a different vein, in our work, we leverage human semantic knowledge to investigate the possibility of being included in frameworks of fake image detection. To achieve this, we collect a novel dataset of partially manipulated images using diffusion models and conduct an eye-tracking experiment to record the eye movements of different observers while viewing real and fake stimuli. A preliminary statistical analysis is conducted to explore the distinctive patterns in how humans perceive genuine and altered images. Statistical findings reveal that, when perceiving counterfeit samples, humans tend to focus on more confined regions of the image, in contrast to the more dispersed observational pattern observed when viewing genuine images.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soheil Gharatappeh, Sepideh Neshatfar, Salimeh Yasaei Sekeh, Vikas Dhiman</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel fog-aware object detection network called FogGuard, designed to address the challenges posed by foggy weather conditions. Autonomous driving systems heavily rely on accurate object detection algorithms, but adverse weather conditions can significantly impact the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs).
  Existing approaches fall into two main categories, 1) image enhancement such as IA-YOLO 2) domain adaptation based approaches. Image enhancement based techniques attempt to generate fog-free image. However, retrieving a fogless image from a foggy image is a much harder problem than detecting objects in a foggy image. Domain-adaptation based approaches, on the other hand, do not make use of labelled datasets in the target domain. Both categories of approaches are attempting to solve a harder version of the problem. Our approach builds over fine-tuning on the
  Our framework is specifically designed to compensate for foggy conditions present in the scene, ensuring robust performance even. We adopt YOLOv3 as the baseline object detection algorithm and introduce a novel Teacher-Student Perceptual loss, to high accuracy object detection in foggy images.
  Through extensive evaluations on common datasets such as PASCAL VOC and RTTS, we demonstrate the improvement in performance achieved by our network. We demonstrate that FogGuard achieves 69.43\% mAP, as compared to 57.78\% for YOLOv3 on the RTTS dataset.
  Furthermore, we show that while our training method increases time complexity, it does not introduce any additional overhead during inference compared to the regular YOLO network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Bedin, Junior Silva Souza, Gabriel Toshio Hirokawa Higa, Alexandre Pereira, Charles Kiefer, Newton Loebens, Hemerson Pistori</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of this paper is to evaluate the use of D-CNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Networks) algorithms to classify pig body conditions in normal or not normal conditions, with a focus on characteristics that are observed in sanitary monitoring, and were used six different algorithms to do this task. The study focused on five pig characteristics, being these caudophagy, ear hematoma, scratches on the body, redness, and natural stains (brown or black). The results of the study showed that D-CNN was effective in classifying deviations in pig body morphologies related to skin characteristics. The evaluation was conducted by analyzing the performance metrics Precision, Recall, and F-score, as well as the statistical analyses ANOVA and the Scott-Knott test. The contribution of this article is characterized by the proposal of using D-CNN networks for morphological classification in pigs, with a focus on characteristics identified in sanitary monitoring. Among the best results, the average Precision metric of 80.6\% to classify caudophagy was achieved for the InceptionResNetV2 network, indicating the potential use of this technology for the proposed task. Additionally, a new image database was created, containing various pig's distinct body characteristics, which can serve as data for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifeng Zhou, Wenliang Zhong, Yuzhi Guo, Michael Xiao, Hehuan Ma, Junzhou Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of computational histopathology, both whole slide images (WSIs) and diagnostic captions provide valuable insights for making diagnostic decisions. However, aligning WSIs with diagnostic captions presents a significant challenge. This difficulty arises from two main factors: 1) Gigapixel WSIs are unsuitable for direct input into deep learning models, and the redundancy and correlation among the patches demand more attention; and 2) Authentic WSI diagnostic captions are extremely limited, making it difficult to train an effective model. To overcome these obstacles, we present PathM3, a multimodal, multi-task, multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for WSI classification and captioning. PathM3 adapts a query-based transformer to effectively align WSIs with diagnostic captions. Given that histopathology visual patterns are redundantly distributed across WSIs, we aggregate each patch feature with MIL method that considers the correlations among instances. Furthermore, our PathM3 overcomes data scarcity in WSI-level captions by leveraging limited WSI diagnostic caption data in the manner of multi-task joint learning. Extensive experiments with improved classification accuracy and caption generation demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both WSI classification and captioning task.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08974">Representing Anatomical Trees by Denoising Diffusion of Implicit Neural Fields</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Sinha, Ghassan Hamarneh</p>
<p>Abstract: Anatomical trees play a central role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, accurately representing anatomical trees is challenging due to their varying and complex topology and geometry. Traditional methods for representing tree structures, captured using medical imaging, while invaluable for visualizing vascular and bronchial networks, exhibit drawbacks in terms of limited resolution, flexibility, and efficiency. Recently, implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for representing shapes accurately and efficiently. We propose a novel approach for representing anatomical trees using INR, while also capturing the distribution of a set of trees via denoising diffusion in the space of INRs. We accurately capture the intricate geometries and topologies of anatomical trees at any desired resolution. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate high-fidelity tree reconstruction with arbitrary resolution yet compact storage, and versatility across anatomical sites and tree complexities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Ramtoula, Daniele De Martini, Matthew Gadd, Paul Newman</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper adapts a general dataset representation technique to produce robust Visual Place Recognition (VPR) descriptors, crucial to enable real-world mobile robot localisation. Two parallel lines of work on VPR have shown, on one side, that general-purpose off-the-shelf feature representations can provide robustness to domain shifts, and, on the other, that fused information from sequences of images improves performance. In our recent work on measuring domain gaps between image datasets, we proposed a Visual Distribution of Neuron Activations (VDNA) representation to represent datasets of images. This representation can naturally handle image sequences and provides a general and granular feature representation derived from a general-purpose model. Moreover, our representation is based on tracking neuron activation values over the list of images to represent and is not limited to a particular neural network layer, therefore having access to high- and low-level concepts. This work shows how VDNAs can be used for VPR by learning a very lightweight and simple encoder to generate task-specific descriptors. Our experiments show that our representation can allow for better robustness than current solutions to serious domain shifts away from the training data distribution, such as to indoor environments and aerial imagery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Kelly, Luhui Hu, Bang Yang, Yu Tian, Deshun Yang, Cindy Yang, Zaoshan Huang, Zihao Li, Jiayin Hu, Yuexian Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models, how to combine the intelligence and capacity of these open-sourced or API-available models to achieve open-world visual perception remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce VisionGPT to consolidate and automate the integration of state-of-the-art foundation models, thereby facilitating vision-language understanding and the development of vision-oriented AI. VisionGPT builds upon a generalized multimodal framework that distinguishes itself through three key features: (1) utilizing LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2) as the pivot to break down users' requests into detailed action proposals to call suitable foundation models; (2) integrating multi-source outputs from foundation models automatically and generating comprehensive responses for users; (3) adaptable to a wide range of applications such as text-conditioned image understanding/generation/editing and visual question answering. This paper outlines the architecture and capabilities of VisionGPT, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the field of computer vision through enhanced efficiency, versatility, and generalization, and performance. Our code and models will be made publicly available. Keywords: VisionGPT, Open-world visual perception, Vision-language understanding, Large language model, and Foundation model</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Zhang, Wei Qin, Weijieying Ren, Lei Wang, Zetong Chen, Richang Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the real-world setting, data often follows a long-tailed distribution, where head classes contain significantly more training samples than tail classes. Consequently, models trained on such data tend to be biased toward head classes. The medium of this bias is imbalanced gradients, which include not only the ratio of scale between positive and negative gradients but also imbalanced gradients from different negative classes. Therefore, we propose the Gradient-Aware Logit Adjustment (GALA) loss, which adjusts the logits based on accumulated gradients to balance the optimization process. Additionally, We find that most of the solutions to long-tailed problems are still biased towards head classes in the end, and we propose a simple and post hoc prediction re-balancing strategy to further mitigate the basis toward head class. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple popular long-tailed recognition benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of these two designs. Our approach achieves top-1 accuracy of 48.5\%, 41.4\%, and 73.3\% on CIFAR100-LT, Places-LT, and iNaturalist, outperforming the state-of-the-art method GCL by a significant margin of 3.62\%, 0.76\% and 1.2\%, respectively.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09037">The First to Know: How Token Distributions Reveal Hidden Knowledge in Large Vision-Language Models?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinyu Zhao, Ming Xu, Kartik Gupta, Akshay Asthana, Liang Zheng, Stephen Gould</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), designed to interpret and respond to human instructions, occasionally generate hallucinated or harmful content due to inappropriate instructions. This study uses linear probing to shed light on the hidden knowledge at the output layer of LVLMs. We demonstrate that the logit distributions of the first tokens contain sufficient information to determine whether to respond to the instructions, including recognizing unanswerable visual questions, defending against multi-modal jailbreaking attack, and identifying deceptive questions. Such hidden knowledge is gradually lost in logits of subsequent tokens during response generation. Then, we illustrate a simple decoding strategy at the generation of the first token, effectively improving the generated content. In experiments, we find a few interesting insights: First, the CLIP model already contains a strong signal for solving these tasks, indicating potential bias in the existing datasets. Second, we observe performance improvement by utilizing the first logit distributions on three additional tasks, including indicting uncertainty in math solving, mitigating hallucination, and image classification. Last, with the same training data, simply finetuning LVLMs improve models' performance but is still inferior to linear probing on these tasks.</p>

In this paper, we present CLOAF, which exploits the diffeomorphic nature of Ordinary Differential Equations to eliminate such self-intersections while still imposing body shape constraints. We show that, unlike earlier approaches to addressing this issue, ours completely eliminates the self-intersections without compromising the accuracy of the reconstructions. Being differentiable, CLOAF can be used to fine-tune pose and shape estimation baselines to improve their overall performance and eliminate self-intersections in their predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our CLOAF strategy can be applied to practically any motion field induced by the user. CLOAF also makes it possible to edit motion to interact with the environment without worrying about potential collision or loss of body-shape prior.</p>

<p>Abstract: The enormous success of diffusion models in text-to-image synthesis has made them promising candidates for the next generation of end-user applications for image generation and editing. Previous works have focused on improving the usability of diffusion models by reducing the inference time or increasing user interactivity by allowing new, fine-grained controls such as region-based text prompts. However, we empirically find that integrating both branches of works is nontrivial, limiting the potential of diffusion models. To solve this incompatibility, we present StreamMultiDiffusion, the first real-time region-based text-to-image generation framework. By stabilizing fast inference techniques and restructuring the model into a newly proposed multi-prompt stream batch architecture, we achieve $\times 10$ faster panorama generation than existing solutions, and the generation speed of 1.57 FPS in region-based text-to-image synthesis on a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Our solution opens up a new paradigm for interactive image generation named semantic palette, where high-quality images are generated in real-time from given multiple hand-drawn regions, encoding prescribed semantic meanings (e.g., eagle, girl).

However, we found that there were bottlenecks in both training datasets and real-time performance when deploying algorithms on actual assembly line. Therefore, we developed a promising strategy for expanding industrial datasets, which utilized large models with strong generalization abilities to achieve efficient, high-quality, and large-scale dataset expansion, solving the problem of insufficient and low-quality industrial datasets. We also applied this strategy to video action recognition. We proposed a method of converting hand action recognition problems into hand skeletal trajectory classification problems, which solved the real-time performance problem of industrial algorithms. In the "hand movements during wire insertion" scenarios on the actual assembly line, the accuracy of hand action recognition reached 98.8\%. We conducted detailed experimental analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the method, and deployed the entire process on Midea's actual assembly line.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerrin Bright, Bavesh Balaji, Harish Prakash, Yuhao Chen, David A Clausi, John Zelek</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) with in-the-wild data is a formidable challenge and is often hindered by depth ambiguities and reduced precision. Existing works resort to either pose priors or multi-modal data such as multi-view or point cloud information, though their methods often overlook the valuable scene-depth information inherently present in a single image. Moreover, achieving robust HMR for out-of-distribution (OOD) data is exceedingly challenging due to inherent variations in pose, shape and depth. Consequently, understanding the underlying distribution becomes a vital subproblem in modeling human forms. Motivated by the need for unambiguous and robust human modeling, we introduce Distribution and depth-aware human mesh recovery (D2A-HMR), an end-to-end transformer architecture meticulously designed to minimize the disparity between distributions and incorporate scene-depth leveraging prior depth information. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in handling OOD data in certain scenarios while consistently achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art HMR methods on controlled datasets.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09065">When Semantic Segmentation Meets Frequency Aliasing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Linwei Chen, Lin Gu, Ying Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in semantic segmentation, where and what pixels are hard to segment remains largely unexplored. Existing research only separates an image into easy and hard regions and empirically observes the latter are associated with object boundaries. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of hard pixel errors, categorizing them into three types: false responses, merging mistakes, and displacements. Our findings reveal a quantitative association between hard pixels and aliasing, which is distortion caused by the overlapping of frequency components in the Fourier domain during downsampling. To identify the frequencies responsible for aliasing, we propose using the equivalent sampling rate to calculate the Nyquist frequency, which marks the threshold for aliasing. Then, we introduce the aliasing score as a metric to quantify the extent of aliasing. While positively correlated with the proposed aliasing score, three types of hard pixels exhibit different patterns. Here, we propose two novel de-aliasing filter (DAF) and frequency mixing (FreqMix) modules to alleviate aliasing degradation by accurately removing or adjusting frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency. The DAF precisely removes the frequencies responsible for aliasing before downsampling, while the FreqMix dynamically selects high-frequency components within the encoder block. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic segmentation and low-light instance segmentation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Tran, Di Chang, Maksim Siniukov, Mohammad Soleymani</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-human communication is like a delicate dance where listeners and speakers concurrently interact to maintain conversational dynamics. Hence, an effective model for generating listener nonverbal behaviors requires understanding the dyadic context and interaction. In this paper, we present an effective framework for creating 3D facial motions in dyadic interactions. Existing work consider a listener as a reactive agent with reflexive behaviors to the speaker's voice and facial motions. The heart of our framework is Dyadic Interaction Modeling (DIM), a pre-training approach that jointly models speakers' and listeners' motions through masking and contrastive learning to learn representations that capture the dyadic context. To enable the generation of non-deterministic behaviors, we encode both listener and speaker motions into discrete latent representations, through VQ-VAE. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in generating listener motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art according to the quantitative measures capturing the diversity and realism of generated motions. Qualitative results demonstrate the superior capabilities of the proposed approach in generating diverse and realistic expressions, eye blinks and head gestures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sipeng Zheng, Bohan Zhou, Yicheng Feng, Ye Wang, Zongqing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{UniCode}, a novel approach within the domain of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that learns a unified codebook to efficiently tokenize visual, text, and potentially other types of signals. This innovation addresses a critical limitation in existing MLLMs: their reliance on a text-only codebook, which restricts MLLM's ability to generate images and texts in a multimodal context. Towards this end, we propose a language-driven iterative training paradigm, coupled with an in-context pre-training task we term ``image decompression'', enabling our model to interpret compressed visual data and generate high-quality images.The unified codebook empowers our model to extend visual instruction tuning to non-linguistic generation tasks. Moreover, UniCode is adaptable to diverse stacked quantization approaches in order to compress visual signals into a more compact token representation. Despite using significantly fewer parameters and less data during training, Unicode demonstrates promising capabilities in visual reconstruction and generation. It also achieves performances comparable to leading MLLMs across a spectrum of VQA benchmarks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09079">PreSight: Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Perception with City-Scale NeRF Priors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyuan Yuan, Yucheng Mao, Jiawei Yang, Yicheng Liu, Yue Wang, Hang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely extensively on perception systems to navigate and interpret their surroundings. Despite significant advancements in these systems recently, challenges persist under conditions like occlusion, extreme lighting, or in unfamiliar urban areas. Unlike these systems, humans do not solely depend on immediate observations to perceive the environment. In navigating new cities, humans gradually develop a preliminary mental map to supplement real-time perception during subsequent visits. Inspired by this human approach, we introduce a novel framework, Pre-Sight, that leverages past traversals to construct static prior memories, enhancing online perception in later navigations. Our method involves optimizing a city-scale neural radiance field with data from previous journeys to generate neural priors. These priors, rich in semantic and geometric details, are derived without manual annotations and can seamlessly augment various state-of-the-art perception models, improving their efficacy with minimal additional computational cost. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the framework's high compatibility with diverse online perception models. Specifically, it shows remarkable improvements in HD-map construction and occupancy prediction tasks, highlighting its potential as a new perception framework for autonomous driving systems. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yuantianyuan01/PreSight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haohan Weng, Danqing Huang, Yu Qiao, Zheng Hu, Chin-Yew Lin, Tong Zhang, C. L. Philip Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Templates serve as a good starting point to implement a design (e.g., banner, slide) but it takes great effort from designers to manually create. In this paper, we present Desigen, an automatic template creation pipeline which generates background images as well as harmonious layout elements over the background. Different from natural images, a background image should preserve enough non-salient space for the overlaying layout elements. To equip existing advanced diffusion-based models with stronger spatial control, we propose two simple but effective techniques to constrain the saliency distribution and reduce the attention weight in desired regions during the background generation process. Then conditioned on the background, we synthesize the layout with a Transformer-based autoregressive generator. To achieve a more harmonious composition, we propose an iterative inference strategy to adjust the synthesized background and layout in multiple rounds. We constructed a design dataset with more than 40k advertisement banners to verify our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline generates high-quality templates comparable to human designers. More than a single-page design, we further show an application of presentation generation that outputs a set of theme-consistent slides.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09108">CardioCaps: Attention-based Capsule Network for Class-Imbalanced Echocardiogram Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunkyung Han, Jihyeon Seong, Jaesik Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets) is a novel architecture that utilizes vector-wise representations formed by multiple neurons. Specifically, the Dynamic Routing CapsNets (DR-CapsNets) employ an affine matrix and dynamic routing mechanism to train capsules and acquire translation-equivariance properties, enhancing its robustness compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Echocardiograms, which capture moving images of the heart, present unique challenges for traditional image classification methods. In this paper, we explore the potential of DR-CapsNets and propose CardioCaps, a novel attention-based DR-CapsNet architecture for class-imbalanced echocardiogram classification. CardioCaps comprises two key components: a weighted margin loss incorporating a regression auxiliary loss and an attention mechanism. First, the weighted margin loss prioritizes positive cases, supplemented by an auxiliary loss function based on the Ejection Fraction (EF) regression task, a crucial measure of cardiac function. This approach enhances the model's resilience in the face of class imbalance. Second, recognizing the quadratic complexity of dynamic routing leading to training inefficiencies, we adopt the attention mechanism as a more computationally efficient alternative. Our results demonstrate that CardioCaps surpasses traditional machine learning baseline methods, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with sampling methods and a class weight matrix. Furthermore, CardioCaps outperforms other deep learning baseline methods such as CNNs, ResNets, U-Nets, and ViTs, as well as advanced CapsNets methods such as EM-CapsNets and Efficient-CapsNets. Notably, our model demonstrates robustness to class imbalance, achieving high precision even in datasets with a substantial proportion of negative cases.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09124">Single Domain Generalization for Crowd Counting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoxuan Peng, S. -H. Gary Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Current image-based crowd counting widely employs density map regression due to its promising results. However, the method often suffers from severe performance degradation when tested on data from unseen scenarios. To address this so-called "domain shift" problem, we investigate single domain generalization (SDG) for crowd counting. The existing SDG approaches are mainly for classification and segmentation, and can hardly be extended to our case due to its regression nature and label ambiguity (i.e., ambiguous pixel-level ground truths). We propose MPCount, a novel SDG approach effective even for narrow source distribution. Reconstructing diverse features for density map regression with a single memory bank, MPCount retains only domain-invariant representations using a content error mask and attention consistency loss. It further introduces patch-wise classification as an auxiliary task to boost the robustness of density prediction to achieve highly accurate labels. Through extensive experiments on different datasets, MPCount is shown to significantly improve counting accuracy compared to the state of the art under diverse scenarios unobserved in the training data of narrow source distribution.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangtian Xue, Jiasong Wu, Youyong Kong, Lotfi Senhadji, Huazhong Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring object removal refers to removing the specific object in an image referred by natural language expressions and filling the missing region with reasonable semantics. To address this task, we construct the ComCOCO, a synthetic dataset consisting of 136,495 referring expressions for 34,615 objects in 23,951 image pairs. Each pair contains an image with referring expressions and the ground truth after elimination. We further propose an end-to-end syntax-aware hybrid mapping network with an encoding-decoding structure. Linguistic features are hierarchically extracted at the syntactic level and fused in the downsampling process of visual features with multi-head attention. The feature-aligned pyramid network is leveraged to generate segmentation masks and replace internal pixels with region affinity learned from external semantics in high-level feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms diffusion models and two-stage methods which process the segmentation and inpainting task separately by a significant margin.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09139">Metadata-Driven Federated Learning of Connectional Brain Templates in Non-IID Multi-Domain Scenarios</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Geng Chen, Qingyue Wang, Islem Rekik</p>
<p>Abstract: A connectional brain template (CBT) is a holistic representation of a population of multi-view brain connectivity graphs, encoding shared patterns and normalizing typical variations across individuals. The federation of CBT learning allows for an inclusive estimation of the representative center of multi-domain brain connectivity datasets in a fully data-preserving manner. However, existing methods overlook the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IDD) issue stemming from multidomain brain connectivity heterogeneity, in which data domains are drawn from different hospitals and imaging modalities. To overcome this limitation, we unprecedentedly propose a metadata-driven federated learning framework, called MetaFedCBT, for cross-domain CBT learning. Given the data drawn from a specific domain (i.e., hospital), our model aims to learn metadata in a fully supervised manner by introducing a local client-based regressor network. The generated meta-data is forced to meet the statistical attributes (e.g., mean) of other domains, while preserving their privacy. Our supervised meta-data generation approach boosts the unsupervised learning of a more centered, representative, and holistic CBT of a particular brain state across diverse domains. As the federated learning progresses over multiple rounds, the learned metadata and associated generated connectivities are continuously updated to better approximate the target domain information. MetaFedCBT overcomes the non-IID issue of existing methods by generating informative brain connectivities for privacy-preserving holistic CBT learning with guidance using metadata. Extensive experiments on multi-view morphological brain networks of normal and patient subjects demonstrate that our MetaFedCBT is a superior federated CBT learning model and significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09140">Sculpt3D: Multi-View Consistent Text-to-3D Generation with Sparse 3D Prior</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Chen, Xiaofeng Yang, Fan Yang, Chengzeng Feng, Zhoujie Fu, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Guosheng Lin, Fayao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works on text-to-3d generation show that using only 2D diffusion supervision for 3D generation tends to produce results with inconsistent appearances (e.g., faces on the back view) and inaccurate shapes (e.g., animals with extra legs). Existing methods mainly address this issue by retraining diffusion models with images rendered from 3D data to ensure multi-view consistency while struggling to balance 2D generation quality with 3D consistency. In this paper, we present a new framework Sculpt3D that equips the current pipeline with explicit injection of 3D priors from retrieved reference objects without re-training the 2D diffusion model. Specifically, we demonstrate that high-quality and diverse 3D geometry can be guaranteed by keypoints supervision through a sparse ray sampling approach. Moreover, to ensure accurate appearances of different views, we further modulate the output of the 2D diffusion model to the correct patterns of the template views without altering the generated object's style. These two decoupled designs effectively harness 3D information from reference objects to generate 3D objects while preserving the generation quality of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments show our method can largely improve the multi-view consistency while retaining fidelity and diversity.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09172">SHAN: Object-Level Privacy Detection via Inference on Scene Heterogeneous Graph</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohang Jiang, Bingkui Tong, Xia Du, Ahmed Alhammadi, Jizhe Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rise of social platforms, protecting privacy has become an important issue. Privacy object detection aims to accurately locate private objects in images. It is the foundation of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights and ensuring responsible data handling practices in the digital age. Since privacy of object is not shift-invariant, the essence of the privacy object detection task is inferring object privacy based on scene information. However, privacy object detection has long been studied as a subproblem of common object detection tasks. Therefore, existing methods suffer from serious deficiencies in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. Moreover, creating large-scale privacy datasets is difficult due to legal constraints and existing privacy datasets lack label granularity. The granularity of existing privacy detection methods remains limited to the image level. To address the above two issues, we introduce two benchmark datasets for object-level privacy detection and propose SHAN, Scene Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, a model constructs a scene heterogeneous graph from an image and utilizes self-attention mechanisms for scene inference to obtain object privacy. Through experiments, we demonstrated that SHAN performs excellently in privacy object detection tasks, with all metrics surpassing those of the baseline model.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09176">Switch Diffusion Transformer: Synergizing Denoising Tasks with Sparse Mixture-of-Experts</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Byeongjun Park, Hyojun Go, Jin-Young Kim, Sangmin Woo, Seokil Ham, Changick Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a range of generative tasks. Recent efforts to enhance diffusion model architectures have reimagined them as a form of multi-task learning, where each task corresponds to a denoising task at a specific noise level. While these efforts have focused on parameter isolation and task routing, they fall short of capturing detailed inter-task relationships and risk losing semantic information, respectively. In response, we introduce Switch Diffusion Transformer (Switch-DiT), which establishes inter-task relationships between conflicting tasks without compromising semantic information. To achieve this, we employ a sparse mixture-of-experts within each transformer block to utilize semantic information and facilitate handling conflicts in tasks through parameter isolation. Additionally, we propose a diffusion prior loss, encouraging similar tasks to share their denoising paths while isolating conflicting ones. Through these, each transformer block contains a shared expert across all tasks, where the common and task-specific denoising paths enable the diffusion model to construct its beneficial way of synergizing denoising tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving both image quality and convergence rate, and further analysis demonstrates that Switch-DiT constructs tailored denoising paths across various generation scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Mohammadi, M. Babai, M. H. F. Wilkinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to advancements in digital cameras, it is easy to gather multiple images (or videos) from an object under different conditions. Therefore, image-set classification has attracted more attention, and different solutions were proposed to model them. A popular way to model image sets is subspaces, which form a manifold called the Grassmann manifold. In this contribution, we extend the application of Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization to deal with Grassmann manifold. The proposed model returns a set of prototype subspaces and a relevance vector. While prototypes model typical behaviours within classes, the relevance factors specify the most discriminative principal vectors (or images) for the classification task. They both provide insights into the model's decisions by highlighting influential images and pixels for predictions. Moreover, due to learning prototypes, the model complexity of the new method during inference is independent of dataset size, unlike previous works. We applied it to several recognition tasks including handwritten digit recognition, face recognition, activity recognition, and object recognition. Experiments demonstrate that it outperforms previous works with lower complexity and can successfully model the variation, such as handwritten style or lighting conditions. Moreover, the presence of relevances makes the model robust to the selection of subspaces' dimensionality.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09190">Intention-aware Denoising Diffusion Model for Trajectory Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liu, Shibo He, Haoyu Liu, Jiming Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential component in autonomous driving, particularly for collision avoidance systems. Considering the inherent uncertainty of the task, numerous studies have utilized generative models to produce multiple plausible future trajectories for each agent. However, most of them suffer from restricted representation ability or unstable training issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose utilizing the diffusion model to generate the distribution of future trajectories. Two cruxes are to be settled to realize such an idea. First, the diversity of intention is intertwined with the uncertain surroundings, making the true distribution hard to parameterize. Second, the diffusion process is time-consuming during the inference phase, rendering it unrealistic to implement in a real-time driving system. We propose an Intention-aware denoising Diffusion Model (IDM), which tackles the above two problems. We decouple the original uncertainty into intention uncertainty and action uncertainty and model them with two dependent diffusion processes. To decrease the inference time, we reduce the variable dimensions in the intention-aware diffusion process and restrict the initial distribution of the action-aware diffusion process, which leads to fewer diffusion steps. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY dataset. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results, with an FDE of 13.83 pixels on the SDD dataset and 0.36 meters on the ETH/UCY dataset. Compared with the original diffusion model, IDM reduces inference time by two-thirds. Interestingly, our experiments further reveal that introducing intention information is beneficial in modeling the diffusion process of fewer steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhe Xiong, Hui Chen, Tianxiang Hao, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Yuesong Zhang, Guoxin Wang, Yongjun Bao, Guiguang Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the scale of transformers has grown rapidly, which introduces considerable challenges in terms of training overhead and inference efficiency in the scope of task adaptation. Existing works, namely Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and model compression, have separately investigated the challenges. However, PEFT cannot guarantee the inference efficiency of the original backbone, especially for large-scale models. Model compression requires significant training costs for structure searching and re-training. Consequently, a simple combination of them cannot guarantee accomplishing both training efficiency and inference efficiency with minimal costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Parallel Yielding Re-Activation (PYRA) method for such a challenge of training-inference efficient task adaptation. PYRA first utilizes parallel yielding adaptive weights to comprehensively perceive the data distribution in downstream tasks. A re-activation strategy for token modulation is then applied for tokens to be merged, leading to calibrated token features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PYRA outperforms all competing methods under both low compression rate and high compression rate, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in maintaining both training efficiency and inference efficiency for large-scale foundation models. Our code will be released to the public.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09193">Are Vision Language Models Texture or Shape Biased and Can We Steer Them?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Paul Gavrikov, Jovita Lukasik, Steffen Jung, Robert Geirhos, Bianca Lamm, Muhammad Jehanzeb Mirza, Margret Keuper, Janis Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have drastically changed the computer vision model landscape in only a few years, opening an exciting array of new applications from zero-shot image classification, over to image captioning, and visual question answering. Unlike pure vision models, they offer an intuitive way to access visual content through language prompting. The wide applicability of such models encourages us to ask whether they also align with human vision - specifically, how far they adopt human-induced visual biases through multimodal fusion, or whether they simply inherit biases from pure vision models. One important visual bias is the texture vs. shape bias, or the dominance of local over global information. In this paper, we study this bias in a wide range of popular VLMs. Interestingly, we find that VLMs are often more shape-biased than their vision encoders, indicating that visual biases are modulated to some extent through text in multimodal models. If text does indeed influence visual biases, this suggests that we may be able to steer visual biases not just through visual input but also through language: a hypothesis that we confirm through extensive experiments. For instance, we are able to steer shape bias from as low as 49% to as high as 72% through prompting alone. For now, the strong human bias towards shape (96%) remains out of reach for all tested VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongchen Luo, Kai Zhu, Wei Zhai, Yang Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Ego-to-exo video generation refers to generating the corresponding exocentric video according to the egocentric video, providing valuable applications in AR/VR and embodied AI. Benefiting from advancements in diffusion model techniques, notable progress has been achieved in video generation. However, existing methods build upon the spatiotemporal consistency assumptions between adjacent frames, which cannot be satisfied in the ego-to-exo scenarios due to drastic changes in views. To this end, this paper proposes an Intention-Driven Ego-to-exo video generation framework (IDE) that leverages action intention consisting of human movement and action description as view-independent representation to guide video generation, preserving the consistency of content and motion. Specifically, the egocentric head trajectory is first estimated through multi-view stereo matching. Then, cross-view feature perception module is introduced to establish correspondences between exo- and ego- views, guiding the trajectory transformation module to infer human full-body movement from the head trajectory. Meanwhile, we present an action description unit that maps the action semantics into the feature space consistent with the exocentric image. Finally, the inferred human movement and high-level action descriptions jointly guide the generation of exocentric motion and interaction content (i.e., corresponding optical flow and occlusion maps) in the backward process of the diffusion model, ultimately warping them into the corresponding exocentric video. We conduct extensive experiments on the relevant dataset with diverse exo-ego video pairs, and our IDE outperforms state-of-the-art models in both subjective and objective assessments, demonstrating its efficacy in ego-to-exo video generation.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09195">SAM-Lightening: A Lightweight Segment Anything Model with Dilated Flash Attention to Achieve 30 times Acceleration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanfei Songa, Bangzheng Pua, Peng Wanga, Hongxu Jiang, Dong Donga, Yiqing Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered significant attention in segmentation tasks due to their zero-shot generalization ability. However, a broader application of SAMs to real-world practice has been restricted by their low inference speed and high computational memory demands, which mainly stem from the attention mechanism. Existing work concentrated on optimizing the encoder, yet has not adequately addressed the inefficiency of the attention mechanism itself, even when distilled to a smaller model, which thus leaves space for further improvement. In response, we introduce SAM-Lightening, a variant of SAM, that features a re-engineered attention mechanism, termed Dilated Flash Attention. It not only facilitates higher parallelism, enhancing processing efficiency but also retains compatibility with the existing FlashAttention. Correspondingly, we propose a progressive distillation to enable an efficient knowledge transfer from the vanilla SAM without costly training from scratch. Experiments on COCO and LVIS reveal that SAM-Lightening significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both run-time efficiency and segmentation accuracy. Specifically, it can achieve an inference speed of 7 milliseconds (ms) per image, for images of size 1024*1024 pixels, which is 30.1 times faster than the vanilla SAM and 2.1 times than the state-of-the-art. Moreover, it takes only 244MB memory, which is 3.5\% of the vanilla SAM. The code and weights are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SAM-LIGHTENING-BC25/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziran Zhu, Tongda Xu, Ling Li, Yan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative adversial network (GAN) is a type of generative model that maps a high-dimensional noise to samples in target distribution. However, the dimension of noise required in GAN is not well understood. Previous approaches view GAN as a mapping from a continuous distribution to another continous distribution. In this paper, we propose to view GAN as a discrete sampler instead. From this perspective, we build a connection between the minimum noise required and the bits to losslessly compress the images. Furthermore, to understand the behaviour of GAN when noise dimension is limited, we propose divergence-entropy trade-off. This trade-off depicts the best divergence we can achieve when noise is limited. And as rate distortion trade-off, it can be numerically solved when source distribution is known. Finally, we verifies our theory with experiments on image generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyung-Il Kim, Kimin Yun, Jun-Seok Yun, Yuseok Bae</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, foundation models trained on massive datasets to adapt to a wide range of domains have attracted considerable attention and are actively being explored within the computer vision community. Among these, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands out for its remarkable progress in generalizability and flexibility for image segmentation tasks, achieved through prompt-based object mask generation. However, despite its strength, SAM faces two key limitations when applied to customized instance segmentation that segments specific objects or those in unique environments not typically present in the training data: 1) the ambiguity inherent in input prompts and 2) the necessity for extensive additional training to achieve optimal segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, customized instance segmentation via prompt learning tailored to SAM. Our method involves a prompt learning module (PLM), which adjusts input prompts into the embedding space to better align with user intentions, thereby enabling more efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a point matching module (PMM) to enhance the feature representation for finer segmentation by ensuring detailed alignment with ground truth boundaries. Experimental results on various customized instance segmentation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Deng, Sha Zhang, Feras Dayoub, Wanli Ouyang, Yanyong Zhang, Ian Reid</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we present PoIFusion, a simple yet effective multi-modal 3D object detection framework to fuse the information of RGB images and LiDAR point clouds at the point of interest (abbreviated as PoI). Technically, our PoIFusion follows the paradigm of query-based object detection, formulating object queries as dynamic 3D boxes. The PoIs are adaptively generated from each query box on the fly, serving as the keypoints to represent a 3D object and play the role of basic units in multi-modal fusion. Specifically, we project PoIs into the view of each modality to sample the corresponding feature and integrate the multi-modal features at each PoI through a dynamic fusion block. Furthermore, the features of PoIs derived from the same query box are aggregated together to update the query feature. Our approach prevents information loss caused by view transformation and eliminates the computation-intensive global attention, making the multi-modal 3D object detector more applicable. We conducted extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to evaluate our approach. Remarkably, our PoIFusion achieves 74.9\% NDS and 73.4\% mAP, setting a state-of-the-art record on the multi-modal 3D object detection benchmark.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09230">Improving Distant 3D Object Detection Using 2D Box Supervision</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zetong Yang, Zhiding Yu, Chris Choy, Renhao Wang, Anima Anandkumar, Jose M. Alvarez</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the detection of distant 3d objects is an important yet challenging task. For camera-based 3D perception, the annotation of 3d bounding relies heavily on LiDAR for accurate depth information. As such, the distance of annotation is often limited due to the sparsity of LiDAR points on distant objects, which hampers the capability of existing detectors for long-range scenarios. We address this challenge by considering only 2D box supervision for distant objects since they are easy to annotate. We propose LR3D, a framework that learns to recover the missing depth of distant objects. LR3D adopts an implicit projection head to learn the generation of mapping between 2D boxes and depth using the 3D supervision on close objects. This mapping allows the depth estimation of distant objects conditioned on their 2D boxes, making long-range 3D detection with 2D supervision feasible. Experiments show that without distant 3D annotations, LR3D allows camera-based methods to detect distant objects (over 200m) with comparable accuracy to full 3D supervision. Our framework is general, and could widely benefit 3D detection methods to a large extent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Chu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adverse weather conditions including haze, snow and rain lead to decline in image qualities, which often causes a decline in performance for deep-learning based detection networks. Most existing approaches attempts to rectify hazy images before performing object detection, which increases the complexity of the network and may result in the loss in latent information. To better integrate image restoration and object detection tasks, we designed a double-route network with an attention feature fusion module, taking both hazy and dehazed features into consideration. We also proposed a subnetwork to provide haze-free features to the detection network. Specifically, our D-YOLO improves the performance of the detection network by minimizing the distance between the clear feature extraction subnetwork and detection network. Experiments on RTTS and FoggyCityscapes datasets show that D-YOLO demonstrates better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. It is a robust detection framework for bridging the gap between low-level dehazing and high-level detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donglin Di, Jiahui Yang, Chaofan Luo, Zhou Xue, Wei Chen, Xun Yang, Yue Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-3D generation represents an exciting field that has seen rapid advancements, facilitating the transformation of textual descriptions into detailed 3D models. However, current progress often neglects the intricate high-order correlation of geometry and texture within 3D objects, leading to challenges such as over-smoothness, over-saturation and the Janus problem. In this work, we propose a method named ``3D Gaussian Generation via Hypergraph (Hyper-3DG)'', designed to capture the sophisticated high-order correlations present within 3D objects. Our framework is anchored by a well-established mainflow and an essential module, named ``Geometry and Texture Hypergraph Refiner (HGRefiner)''. This module not only refines the representation of 3D Gaussians but also accelerates the update process of these 3D Gaussians by conducting the Patch-3DGS Hypergraph Learning on both explicit attributes and latent visual features. Our framework allows for the production of finely generated 3D objects within a cohesive optimization, effectively circumventing degradation. Extensive experimentation has shown that our proposed method significantly enhances the quality of 3D generation while incurring no additional computational overhead for the underlying framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Liu, Haosen Yang, Paul J. van Diest, Josien P. W. Pluim, Mitko Veta</p>
<p>Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) marks a significant advancement in segmentation models, offering powerful zero-shot capabilities and dynamic prompting. However, existing medical SAMs are not suitable for the multi-scale nature of whole-slide images (WSIs), restricting their effectiveness. To resolve this drawback, we present WSI-SAM, enhancing SAM with precise object segmentation capabilities for histopathology images using multi-resolution patches, while preserving its original prompt-driven design, efficiency, and zero-shot adaptability. To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we keep SAM frozen, only introducing minimal additional parameters and computation. In particular, we introduce High-Resolution (HR) token, Low-Resolution (LR) token and dual mask decoder. This decoder integrates the original SAM mask decoder with a lightweight fusion module that integrates features at multiple scales. Instead of predicting a mask independently, we integrate HR and LR token at intermediate layer to jointly learn features of the same object across multiple resolutions. Experiments show that our WSI-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art SAM and its variants. In particular, our model outperforms SAM by 4.1 and 2.5 percent points on a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) segmentation tasks and breast cancer metastasis segmentation task (CAMELYON16 dataset).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Sun, Donghao Zhang, Zongyuan Ge, Jiaxu Wang, Jia Li, Zheng Fang, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Event camera, a novel bio-inspired vision sensor, has drawn a lot of attention for its low latency, low power consumption, and high dynamic range. Currently, overfitting remains a critical problem in event-based classification tasks for Spiking Neural Network (SNN) due to its relatively weak spatial representation capability. Data augmentation is a simple but efficient method to alleviate overfitting and improve the generalization ability of neural networks, and saliency-based augmentation methods are proven to be effective in the image processing field. However, there is no approach available for extracting saliency maps from SNNs. Therefore, for the first time, we present Spiking Layer-Time-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLTRP) and Spiking Layer-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLRP) in order for SNN to generate stable and accurate CAMs and saliency maps. Based on this, we propose EventRPG, which leverages relevance propagation on the spiking neural network for more efficient augmentation. Our proposed method has been evaluated on several SNN structures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in object recognition tasks including N-Caltech101, CIFAR10-DVS, with accuracies of 85.62% and 85.55%, as well as action recognition task SL-Animals with an accuracy of 91.59%.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09281">CLIP-EBC: CLIP Can Count Accurately through Enhanced Blockwise Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Ma, Victor Sanchez, Tanaya Guha</p>
<p>Abstract: The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model has exhibited outstanding performance in recognition problems, such as zero-shot image classification and object detection. However, its ability to count remains understudied due to the inherent challenges of transforming counting--a regression task--into a recognition task. In this paper, we investigate CLIP's potential in counting, focusing specifically on estimating crowd sizes. Existing classification-based crowd-counting methods have encountered issues, including inappropriate discretization strategies, which impede the application of CLIP and result in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Enhanced Blockwise Classification (EBC) framework. In contrast to previous methods, EBC relies on integer-valued bins that facilitate the learning of robust decision boundaries. Within our model-agnostic EBC framework, we introduce CLIP-EBC, the first fully CLIP-based crowd-counting model capable of generating density maps. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse crowd-counting datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our methods. Particularly, EBC can improve existing models by up to 76.9%. Moreover, our CLIP-EBC model surpasses current crowd-counting methods, achieving mean absolute errors of 55.0 and 6.3 on ShanghaiTech part A and part B datasets, respectively. The code will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixuan Shen, Haonan Luo, Sijia Li, Tianrui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene-Text Visual Question Answering (ST-VQA) aims to understand scene text in images and answer questions related to the text content. Most existing methods heavily rely on the accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, and aggressive fine-tuning based on limited spatial location information and erroneous OCR text information often leads to inevitable overfitting. In this paper, we propose a multimodal adversarial training architecture with spatial awareness capabilities. Specifically, we introduce an Adversarial OCR Enhancement (AOE) module, which leverages adversarial training in the embedding space of OCR modality to enhance fault-tolerant representation of OCR texts, thereby reducing noise caused by OCR errors. Simultaneously, We add a Spatial-Aware Self-Attention (SASA) mechanism to help the model better capture the spatial relationships among OCR tokens. Various experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements on both the ST-VQA and TextVQA datasets and provides a novel paradigm for multimodal adversarial training.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09290">SELECTOR: Heterogeneous graph network with convolutional masked autoencoder for multimodal robust prediction of cancer survival</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangrui Pan, Yijun Peng, Yan Li, Xiang Wang, Wenjuan Liu, Liwen Xu, Qingchun Liang, Shaoliang Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival rate of cancer patients is crucial for aiding clinicians in planning appropriate treatment, reducing cancer-related medical expenses, and significantly enhancing patients' quality of life. Multimodal prediction of cancer patient survival offers a more comprehensive and precise approach. However, existing methods still grapple with challenges related to missing multimodal data and information interaction within modalities. This paper introduces SELECTOR, a heterogeneous graph-aware network based on convolutional mask encoders for robust multimodal prediction of cancer patient survival. SELECTOR comprises feature edge reconstruction, convolutional mask encoder, feature cross-fusion, and multimodal survival prediction modules. Initially, we construct a multimodal heterogeneous graph and employ the meta-path method for feature edge reconstruction, ensuring comprehensive incorporation of feature information from graph edges and effective embedding of nodes. To mitigate the impact of missing features within the modality on prediction accuracy, we devised a convolutional masked autoencoder (CMAE) to process the heterogeneous graph post-feature reconstruction. Subsequently, the feature cross-fusion module facilitates communication between modalities, ensuring that output features encompass all features of the modality and relevant information from other modalities. Extensive experiments and analysis on six cancer datasets from TCGA demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both modality-missing and intra-modality information-confirmed cases.

<p>Abstract: Learning medical visual representations through vision-language pre-training has reached remarkable progress. Despite the promising performance, it still faces challenges, i.e., local alignment lacks interpretability and clinical relevance, and the insufficient internal and external representation learning of image-report pairs. To address these issues, we propose an Anatomical Structure-Guided (ASG) framework. Specifically, we parse raw reports into triplets <anatomical region, finding, existence>, and fully utilize each element as supervision to enhance representation learning. For anatomical region, we design an automatic anatomical region-sentence alignment paradigm in collaboration with radiologists, considering them as the minimum semantic units to explore fine-grained local alignment. For finding and existence, we regard them as image tags, applying an image-tag recognition decoder to associate image features with their respective tags within each sample and constructing soft labels for contrastive learning to improve the semantic association of different image-report pairs. We evaluate the proposed ASG framework on two downstream tasks, including five public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have shown a strong zero-shot generalization capability on unseen-domain data. However, when adapting pre-trained VLMs to a sequence of downstream tasks, they are prone to forgetting previously learned knowledge and degrade their zero-shot classification capability. To tackle this problem, we propose a unique Selective Dual-Teacher Knowledge Transfer framework that leverages the most recent fine-tuned and the original pre-trained VLMs as dual teachers to preserve the previously learned knowledge and zero-shot capabilities, respectively. With only access to an unlabeled reference dataset, our proposed framework performs a selective knowledge distillation mechanism by measuring the feature discrepancy from the dual teacher VLMs. Consequently, our selective dual-teacher knowledge distillation would mitigate catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge while preserving the zero-shot capabilities from pre-trained VLMs. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our proposed framework is favorable against state-of-the-art continual learning approaches for preventing catastrophic forgetting and zero-shot degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroush Seifi, Daniel Olmeda Reino, Fabien Despinoy, Rahaf Aljundi</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic Segmentation is one of the most challenging vision tasks, usually requiring large amounts of training data with expensive pixel-level annotations. With the success of foundation models and especially vision-language models, recent works attempt to achieve zero-shot semantic segmentation while requiring either large scale training or additional image/pixel-level annotations. In this work, we build a lightweight module on top of a self-supervised pretrained vision encoder to align patch features with a pre-trained text encoder. Importantly, we generate free annotations for any semantic segmentation dataset using existing foundation models and train our alignment module cost free. We use CLIP to detect objects and SAM to generate high quality object masks. Our approach can bring language-based semantics to any pre-trained vision encoder with minimal training. Our module is lightweight, uses foundation models as a sole source of supervision and shows impressive generalization capability from little training data with no annotation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate identification of breast masses is crucial in diagnosing breast cancer; however, it can be challenging due to their small size and being camouflaged in surrounding normal glands. Worse still, it is also expensive in clinical practice to obtain adequate pixel-wise annotations for training deep neural networks. To overcome these two difficulties with one stone, we propose a semi- and weakly-supervised learning framework for mass segmentation that utilizes limited strongly-labeled samples and sufficient weakly-labeled samples to achieve satisfactory performance. The framework consists of an auxiliary branch to exclude lesion-irrelevant background areas, a segmentation branch for final prediction, and a spatial prompting module to integrate the complementary information of the two branches. We further disentangle encoded obscure features into lesion-related and others to boost performance. Experiments on CBIS-DDSM and INbreast datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ding-Tao Huang, En-Te Lin, Lipeng Chen, Li-Fu Liu, Long Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the success in 6D pose estimation in bin-picking scenarios, existing methods still struggle to produce accurate prediction results for symmetry objects and real world scenarios. The primary bottlenecks include 1) the ambiguity keypoints caused by object symmetries; 2) the domain gap between real and synthetic data. To circumvent these problem, we propose a new 6D pose estimation network with symmetric-aware keypoint prediction and self-training domain adaptation (SD-Net). SD-Net builds on pointwise keypoint regression and deep hough voting to perform reliable detection keypoint under clutter and occlusion. Specifically, at the keypoint prediction stage, we designe a robust 3D keypoints selection strategy considering the symmetry class of objects and equivalent keypoints, which facilitate locating 3D keypoints even in highly occluded scenes. Additionally, we build an effective filtering algorithm on predicted keypoint to dynamically eliminate multiple ambiguity and outlier keypoint candidates. At the domain adaptation stage, we propose the self-training framework using a student-teacher training scheme. To carefully distinguish reliable predictions, we harnesses a tailored heuristics for 3D geometry pseudo labelling based on semi-chamfer distance. On public Sil'eane dataset, SD-Net achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining an average precision of 96%. Testing learning and generalization abilities on public Parametric datasets, SD-Net is 8% higher than the state-of-the-art method. The code is available at https://github.com/dingthuang/SD-Net.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal image fusion and object detection play a vital role in autonomous driving. Current joint learning methods have made significant progress in the multimodal fusion detection task combining the texture detail and objective semantic information. However, the tedious training steps have limited its applications to wider real-world industrial deployment. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end multimodal fusion detection algorithm, named EfficientMFD, to simplify models that exhibit decent performance with only one training step. Synchronous joint optimization is utilized in an end-to-end manner between two components, thus not being affected by the local optimal solution of the individual task. Besides, a comprehensive optimization is established in the gradient matrix between the shared parameters for both tasks. It can converge to an optimal point with fusion detection weights. We extensively test it on several public datasets, demonstrating superior performance on not only visually appealing fusion but also favorable detection performance (e.g., 6.6% mAP50:95) over other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ill-posed image reconstruction problems appear in many scenarios such as remote sensing, where obtaining high quality images is crucial for environmental monitoring, disaster management and urban planning. Deep learning has seen great success in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. However, these inverse problems rarely come with ground truth data, highlighting the importance of unsupervised learning from partial and noisy measurements alone. We propose perspective-equivariant imaging (EI), a framework that leverages perspective variability in optical camera-based imaging systems, such as satellites or handheld cameras, to recover information lost in ill-posed optical camera imaging problems. This extends previous EI work to include a much richer non-linear class of group transforms and is shown to be an excellent prior for satellite and urban image data, where perspective-EI achieves state-of-the-art results in multispectral pansharpening, outperforming other unsupervised methods in the literature.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09333">Griffon v2: Advancing Multimodal Perception with High-Resolution Scaling and Visual-Language Co-Referring</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Zhan, Yousong Zhu, Hongyin Zhao, Fan Yang, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have achieved fine-grained object perception, but the limitation of image resolution remains a significant obstacle to surpass the performance of task-specific experts in complex and dense scenarios. Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, Counting and \etc. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scaling up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details, and significantly improves multimodal perception ability especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize any objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC, phrase grounding, and REG tasks, and outperform expert models in object detection and object counting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uriel Singer, Amit Zohar, Yuval Kirstain, Shelly Sheynin, Adam Polyak, Devi Parikh, Yaniv Taigman</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Emu Video Edit (EVE), a model that establishes a new state-of-the art in video editing without relying on any supervised video editing data. To develop EVE we separately train an image editing adapter and a video generation adapter, and attach both to the same text-to-image model. Then, to align the adapters towards video editing we introduce a new unsupervised distillation procedure, Factorized Diffusion Distillation. This procedure distills knowledge from one or more teachers simultaneously, without any supervised data. We utilize this procedure to teach EVE to edit videos by jointly distilling knowledge to (i) precisely edit each individual frame from the image editing adapter, and (ii) ensure temporal consistency among the edited frames using the video generation adapter. Finally, to demonstrate the potential of our approach in unlocking other capabilities, we align additional combinations of adapters</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Huang, Xiaohuan Pei, Shan You, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in state space models, notably Mamba, have demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences for tasks like language understanding. Yet, their application in vision tasks has not markedly surpassed the performance of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). This paper posits that the key to enhancing Vision Mamba (ViM) lies in optimizing scan directions for sequence modeling. Traditional ViM approaches, which flatten spatial tokens, overlook the preservation of local 2D dependencies, thereby elongating the distance between adjacent tokens. We introduce a novel local scanning strategy that divides images into distinct windows, effectively capturing local dependencies while maintaining a global perspective. Additionally, acknowledging the varying preferences for scan patterns across different network layers, we propose a dynamic method to independently search for the optimal scan choices for each layer, substantially improving performance. Extensive experiments across both plain and hierarchical models underscore our approach's superiority in effectively capturing image representations. For example, our model significantly outperforms Vim-Ti by 3.1% on ImageNet with the same 1.5G FLOPs. Code is available at: https://github.com/hunto/LocalMamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay, Ayan Kumar Bhunia, Pinaki Nath Chowdhury, Aneeshan Sain, Tao Xiang, Timothy Hospedales, Yi-Zhe Song</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose SketchINR, to advance the representation of vector sketches with implicit neural models. A variable length vector sketch is compressed into a latent space of fixed dimension that implicitly encodes the underlying shape as a function of time and strokes. The learned function predicts the $xy$ point coordinates in a sketch at each time and stroke. Despite its simplicity, SketchINR outperforms existing representations at multiple tasks: (i) Encoding an entire sketch dataset into a fixed size latent vector, SketchINR gives $60\times$ and $10\times$ data compression over raster and vector sketches, respectively. (ii) SketchINR's auto-decoder provides a much higher-fidelity representation than other learned vector sketch representations, and is uniquely able to scale to complex vector sketches such as FS-COCO. (iii) SketchINR supports parallelisation that can decode/render $\sim$$100\times$ faster than other learned vector representations such as SketchRNN. (iv) SketchINR, for the first time, emulates the human ability to reproduce a sketch with varying abstraction in terms of number and complexity of strokes. As a first look at implicit sketches, SketchINR's compact high-fidelity representation will support future work in modelling long and complex sketches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhang, Wenqi Shao, Hong Liu, Yongqiang Ma, Ping Luo, Yu Qiao, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant progress in well responding to visual-instructions from users. However, these instructions, encompassing images and text, are susceptible to both intentional and inadvertent attacks. Despite the critical importance of LVLMs' robustness against such threats, current research in this area remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce AVIBench, a framework designed to analyze the robustness of LVLMs when facing various adversarial visual-instructions (AVIs), including four types of image-based AVIs, ten types of text-based AVIs, and nine types of content bias AVIs (such as gender, violence, cultural, and racial biases, among others). We generate 260K AVIs encompassing five categories of multimodal capabilities (nine tasks) and content bias. We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation involving 14 open-source LVLMs to assess their performance. AVIBench also serves as a convenient tool for practitioners to evaluate the robustness of LVLMs against AVIs. Our findings and extensive experimental results shed light on the vulnerabilities of LVLMs, and highlight that inherent biases exist even in advanced closed-source LVLMs like GeminiProVision and GPT-4V. This underscores the importance of enhancing the robustness, security, and fairness of LVLMs. The source code and benchmark will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dinh Phat Do, Taehoon Kim, Jaemin Na, Jiwon Kim, Keonho Lee, Kyunghwan Cho, Wonjun Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation for object detection typically entails transferring knowledge from one visible domain to another visible domain. However, there are limited studies on adapting from the visible to the thermal domain, because the domain gap between the visible and thermal domains is much larger than expected, and traditional domain adaptation can not successfully facilitate learning in this situation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Distinctive Dual-Domain Teacher (D3T) framework that employs distinct training paradigms for each domain. Specifically, we segregate the source and target training sets for building dual-teachers and successively deploy exponential moving average to the student model to individual teachers of each domain. The framework further incorporates a zigzag learning method between dual teachers, facilitating a gradual transition from the visible to thermal domains during training. We validate the superiority of our method through newly designed experimental protocols with well-known thermal datasets, i.e., FLIR and KAIST.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09363">Sentinel-Guided Zero-Shot Learning: A Collaborative Paradigm without Real Data Exposure</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Fan Wan, Xingyu Miao, Haoran Duan, Jingjing Deng, Rui Gao, Yang Long</p>
<p>Abstract: With increasing concerns over data privacy and model copyrights, especially in the context of collaborations between AI service providers and data owners, an innovative SG-ZSL paradigm is proposed in this work. SG-ZSL is designed to foster efficient collaboration without the need to exchange models or sensitive data. It consists of a teacher model, a student model and a generator that links both model entities. The teacher model serves as a sentinel on behalf of the data owner, replacing real data, to guide the student model at the AI service provider's end during training. Considering the disparity of knowledge space between the teacher and student, we introduce two variants of the teacher model: the omniscient and the quasi-omniscient teachers. Under these teachers' guidance, the student model seeks to match the teacher model's performance and explores domains that the teacher has not covered. To trade off between privacy and performance, we further introduce two distinct security-level training protocols: white-box and black-box, enhancing the paradigm's adaptability. Despite the inherent challenges of real data absence in the SG-ZSL paradigm, it consistently outperforms in ZSL and GZSL tasks, notably in the white-box protocol. Our comprehensive evaluation further attests to its robustness and efficiency across various setups, including stringent black-box training protocol.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09367">DF4LCZ: A SAM-Empowered Data Fusion Framework for Scene-Level Local Climate Zone Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqian Wu, Xianping Ma, Jialu Sui, Man-On Pun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in remote sensing (RS) technologies have shown their potential in accurately classifying local climate zones (LCZs). However, traditional scene-level methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often struggle to integrate prior knowledge of ground objects effectively. Moreover, commonly utilized data sources like Sentinel-2 encounter difficulties in capturing detailed ground object information. To tackle these challenges, we propose a data fusion method that integrates ground object priors extracted from high-resolution Google imagery with Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. The proposed method introduces a novel Dual-stream Fusion framework for LCZ classification (DF4LCZ), integrating instance-based location features from Google imagery with the scene-level spatial-spectral features extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery. The framework incorporates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) module empowered by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance feature extraction from Google imagery. Simultaneously, the framework employs a 3D-CNN architecture to learn the spectral-spatial features of Sentinel-2 imagery. Experiments are conducted on a multi-source remote sensing image dataset specifically designed for LCZ classification, validating the effectiveness of the proposed DF4LCZ.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09377">Introducing Routing Functions to Vision-Language Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Low-Rank Bottlenecks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingyu Qu, Tinne Tuytelaars, Marie-Francine Moens</p>
<p>Abstract: Mainstream parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA or Adapter, project a model's hidden states to a lower dimension, allowing pre-trained models to adapt to new data through this low-rank bottleneck. However, PEFT tasks involving multiple modalities, like vision-language (VL) tasks, require not only adaptation to new data but also learning the relationship between different modalities. Targeting at VL PEFT tasks, we propose a family of operations, called routing functions, to enhance VL alignment in the low-rank bottlenecks. The routing functions adopt linear operations and do not introduce new trainable parameters. In-depth analyses are conducted to study their behavior. In various VL PEFT settings, the routing functions significantly improve performance of the original PEFT methods, achieving over 20% improvement on VQAv2 ($\text{RoBERTa}_{\text{large}}$+ViT-L/16) and 30% on COCO Captioning (GPT2-medium+ViT-L/16). Also when fine-tuning a pre-trained multimodal model such as CLIP-BART, we observe smaller but consistent improvements across a range of VL PEFT tasks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09380">Impact of Synthetic Images on Morphing Attack Detection Using a Siamese Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Tapia, Christoph Busch</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper evaluated the impact of synthetic images on Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) using a Siamese network with a semi-hard-loss function. Intra and cross-dataset evaluations were performed to measure synthetic image generalisation capabilities using a cross-dataset for evaluation. Three different pre-trained networks were used as feature extractors from traditional MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3 and EfficientNetB0. Our results show that MAD trained on EfficientNetB0 from FERET, FRGCv2, and FRLL can reach a lower error rate in comparison with SOTA. Conversely, worse performances were reached when the system was trained only with synthetic images. A mixed approach (synthetic + digital) database may help to improve MAD and reduce the error rate. This fact shows that we still need to keep going with our efforts to include synthetic images in the training process.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09394">GiT: Towards Generalist Vision Transformer through Universal Language Interface</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyang Wang, Hao Tang, Li Jiang, Shaoshuai Shi, Muhammad Ferjad Naeem, Hongsheng Li, Bernt Schiele, Liwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a simple, yet effective framework, called GiT, simultaneously applicable for various vision tasks only with a vanilla ViT. Motivated by the universality of the Multi-layer Transformer architecture (e.g, GPT) widely used in large language models (LLMs), we seek to broaden its scope to serve as a powerful vision foundation model (VFM). However, unlike language modeling, visual tasks typically require specific modules, such as bounding box heads for detection and pixel decoders for segmentation, greatly hindering the application of powerful multi-layer transformers in the vision domain. To solve this, we design a universal language interface that empowers the successful auto-regressive decoding to adeptly unify various visual tasks, from image-level understanding (e.g., captioning), over sparse perception (e.g., detection), to dense prediction (e.g., segmentation). Based on the above designs, the entire model is composed solely of a ViT, without any specific additions, offering a remarkable architectural simplification. GiT is a multi-task visual model, jointly trained across five representative benchmarks without task-specific fine-tuning. Interestingly, our GiT builds a new benchmark in generalist performance, and fosters mutual enhancement across tasks, leading to significant improvements compared to isolated training. This reflects a similar impact observed in LLMs. Further enriching training with 27 datasets, GiT achieves strong zero-shot results over various tasks. Due to its simple design, this paradigm holds promise for narrowing the architectural gap between vision and language. Code and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/Haiyang-W/GiT}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksandr Matsun, Numan Saeed, Fadillah Adamsyah Maani, Mohammad Yaqub</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical data often exhibits distribution shifts, which cause test-time performance degradation for deep learning models trained using standard supervised learning pipelines. This challenge is addressed in the field of Domain Generalization (DG) with the sub-field of Single Domain Generalization (SDG) being specifically interesting due to the privacy- or logistics-related issues often associated with medical data. Existing disentanglement-based SDG methods heavily rely on structural information embedded in segmentation masks, however classification labels do not provide such dense information. This work introduces a novel SDG method aimed at medical image classification that leverages channel-wise contrastive disentanglement. It is further enhanced with reconstruction-based style regularization to ensure extraction of distinct style and structure feature representations. We evaluate our method on the complex task of multicenter histopathology image classification, comparing it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) SDG baselines. Results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA by a margin of 1% in average accuracy while also showing more stable performance. This study highlights the importance and challenges of exploring SDG frameworks in the context of the classification task.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09401">Unsupervised Modality-Transferable Video Highlight Detection with Representation Activation Sequence Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingtian Li, Zixun Sun, Xinyu Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying highlight moments of raw video materials is crucial for improving the efficiency of editing videos that are pervasive on internet platforms. However, the extensive work of manually labeling footage has created obstacles to applying supervised methods to videos of unseen categories. The absence of an audio modality that contains valuable cues for highlight detection in many videos also makes it difficult to use multimodal strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel model with cross-modal perception for unsupervised highlight detection. The proposed model learns representations with visual-audio level semantics from image-audio pair data via a self-reconstruction task. To achieve unsupervised highlight detection, we investigate the latent representations of the network and propose the representation activation sequence learning (RASL) module with k-point contrastive learning to learn significant representation activations. To connect the visual modality with the audio modality, we use the symmetric contrastive learning (SCL) module to learn the paired visual and audio representations. Furthermore, an auxiliary task of masked feature vector sequence (FVS) reconstruction is simultaneously conducted during pretraining for representation enhancement. During inference, the cross-modal pretrained model can generate representations with paired visual-audio semantics given only the visual modality. The RASL module is used to output the highlight scores. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Utilizing potent representations of the large vision-language models (VLMs) to accomplish various downstream tasks has attracted increasing attention. Within this research field, soft prompt learning has become a representative approach for efficiently adapting VLMs such as CLIP, to tasks like image classification. However, most existing prompt learning methods learn text tokens that are unexplainable, which cannot satisfy the stringent interpretability requirements of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in high-stakes scenarios like healthcare. To address this issue, we propose a novel explainable prompt learning framework that leverages medical knowledge by aligning the semantics of images, learnable prompts, and clinical concept-driven prompts at multiple granularities. Moreover, our framework addresses the lack of valuable concept annotations by eliciting knowledge from large language models and offers both visual and textual explanations for the prompts. Extensive experiments and explainability analyses conducted on various datasets, with and without concept labels, demonstrate that our method simultaneously achieves superior diagnostic performance, flexibility, and interpretability, shedding light on the effectiveness of foundation models in facilitating XAI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinan Deng, Jiahui Wang, Jingyu Zhao, Xinyu Tian, Guangyan Chen, Yi Yang, Yufeng Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: Environment maps endowed with sophisticated semantics are pivotal for facilitating seamless interaction between robots and humans, enabling them to effectively carry out various tasks. Open-vocabulary maps, powered by Visual-Language models (VLMs), possess inherent advantages, including multimodal retrieval and open-set classes. However, existing open-vocabulary maps are constrained to closed indoor scenarios and VLM features, thereby diminishing their usability and inference capabilities. Moreover, the absence of topological relationships further complicates the accurate querying of specific instances. In this work, we propose OpenGraph, a representation of open-vocabulary hierarchical graph structure designed for large-scale outdoor environments. OpenGraph initially extracts instances and their captions from visual images using 2D foundation models, encoding the captions with features to enhance textual reasoning. Subsequently, 3D incremental panoramic mapping with feature embedding is achieved by projecting images onto LiDAR point clouds. Finally, the environment is segmented based on lane graph connectivity to construct a hierarchical graph. Validation results from real public dataset SemanticKITTI demonstrate that, even without fine-tuning the models, OpenGraph exhibits the ability to generalize to novel semantic classes and achieve the highest segmentation and query accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Jung, Jisang Han, Honggyu An, Jiwon Kang, Seonghoon Park, Seungryong Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in real-time novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. However, 3DGS heavily depends on the accurate initialization derived from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods. When trained with randomly initialized point clouds, 3DGS fails to maintain its ability to produce high-quality images, undergoing large performance drops of 4-5 dB in PSNR. Through extensive analysis of SfM initialization in the frequency domain and analysis of a 1D regression task with multiple 1D Gaussians, we propose a novel optimization strategy dubbed RAIN-GS (Relaxing Accurate Initialization Constraint for 3D Gaussian Splatting), that successfully trains 3D Gaussians from random point clouds. We show the effectiveness of our strategy through quantitative and qualitative comparisons on multiple datasets, largely improving the performance in all settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thang-Anh-Quan Nguyen, Luis Rold\~ao, Nathan Piasco, Moussab Bennehar, Dzmitry Tsishkou</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of separating dynamic objects from static environments using NeRFs has been widely studied in recent years. However, capturing large-scale scenes still poses a challenge due to their complex geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics. Without the help of 3D motion cues, previous methods often require simplified setups with slow camera motion and only a few/single dynamic actors, leading to suboptimal solutions in most urban setups. To overcome such limitations, we present RoDUS, a pipeline for decomposing static and dynamic elements in urban scenes, with thoughtfully separated NeRF models for moving and non-moving components. Our approach utilizes a robust kernel-based initialization coupled with 4D semantic information to selectively guide the learning process. This strategy enables accurate capturing of the dynamics in the scene, resulting in reduced artifacts caused by NeRF on background reconstruction, all by using self-supervision. Notably, experimental evaluations on KITTI-360 and Pandaset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in decomposing challenging urban scenes into precise static and dynamic components.</p>

Most work focuses on generating counterfactual images that look plausible, using auxiliary classifiers to enforce effectiveness of simulated interventions. We investigate pitfalls in this approach, discovering the issue of attribute amplification, where unrelated attributes are spuriously affected during interventions, leading to biases across protected characteristics and disease status. We show that attribute amplification is caused by the use of hard labels in the counterfactual training process and propose soft counterfactual fine-tuning to mitigate this issue. Our method substantially reduces the amplification effect while maintaining effectiveness of generated images, demonstrated on a large chest X-ray dataset. Our work makes an important advancement towards more faithful and unbiased causal modelling in medical imaging.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09432">Efficient Transferability Assessment for Selection of Pre-trained Detectors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Wang, Aoxue Li, Zhenguo Li, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-training followed by downstream fine-tuning is an effective solution for transferring deep-learning-based models. Since finetuning all possible pre-trained models is computational costly, we aim to predict the transferability performance of these pre-trained models in a computational efficient manner. Different from previous work that seek out suitable models for downstream classification and segmentation tasks, this paper studies the efficient transferability assessment of pre-trained object detectors. To this end, we build up a detector transferability benchmark which contains a large and diverse zoo of pre-trained detectors with various architectures, source datasets and training schemes. Given this zoo, we adopt 7 target datasets from 5 diverse domains as the downstream target tasks for evaluation. Further, we propose to assess classification and regression sub-tasks simultaneously in a unified framework. Additionally, we design a complementary metric for evaluating tasks with varying objects. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in assessing transferability under different target domains while efficiently reducing wall-clock time 32$\times$ and requires a mere 5.2\% memory footprint compared to brute-force fine-tuning of all pre-trained detectors.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09433">Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Meta Prompt Representation and Instance Contrastive Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Wang, Aoxue Li, Fengwei Zhou, Zhenguo Li, Qi Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical object detectors are incapable of detecting novel class objects that are not encountered before. Regarding this issue, Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) is proposed, which aims to detect the objects in the candidate class list. However, current OVOD models are suffering from overfitting on the base classes, heavily relying on the large-scale extra data, and complex training process. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel framework with Meta prompt and Instance Contrastive learning (MIC) schemes. Firstly, we simulate a novel-class-emerging scenario to help the prompt learner that learns class and background prompts generalize to novel classes. Secondly, we design an instance-level contrastive strategy to promote intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, which benefits generalization of the detector to novel class objects. Without using knowledge distillation, ensemble model or extra training data during detector training, our proposed MIC outperforms previous SOTA methods trained with these complex techniques on LVIS. Most importantly, MIC shows great generalization ability on novel classes, e.g., with $+4.3\%$ and $+1.9\% \ \mathrm{AP}$ improvement compared with previous SOTA on COCO and Objects365, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Licheng Zhong, Hong-Xing Yu, Jiajun Wu, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing and simulating elastic objects from visual observations is crucial for applications in computer vision and robotics. Existing methods, such as 3D Gaussians, provide modeling for 3D appearance and geometry but lack the ability to simulate physical properties or optimize parameters for heterogeneous objects. We propose Spring-Gaus, a novel framework that integrates 3D Gaussians with physics-based simulation for reconstructing and simulating elastic objects from multi-view videos. Our method utilizes a 3D Spring-Mass model, enabling the optimization of physical parameters at the individual point level while decoupling the learning of physics and appearance. This approach achieves great sample efficiency, enhances generalization, and reduces sensitivity to the distribution of simulation particles. We evaluate Spring-Gaus on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating accurate reconstruction and simulation of elastic objects. This includes future prediction and simulation under varying initial states and environmental parameters. Project page: https://zlicheng.com/spring_gaus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pawel Knap, Peter Hardy, Alberto Tamajo, Hwasup Lim, Hansung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Current human pose estimation systems focus on retrieving an accurate 3D global estimate of a single person. Therefore, this paper presents one of the first 3D multi-person human pose estimation systems that is able to work in real-time and is also able to handle basic forms of occlusion. First, we adjust an off-the-shelf 2D detector and an unsupervised 2D-3D lifting model for use with a 360$^\circ$ panoramic camera and mmWave radar sensors. We then introduce several contributions, including camera and radar calibrations, and the improved matching of people within the image and radar space. The system addresses both the depth and scale ambiguity problems by employing a lightweight 2D-3D pose lifting algorithm that is able to work in real-time while exhibiting accurate performance in both indoor and outdoor environments which offers both an affordable and scalable solution. Notably, our system's time complexity remains nearly constant irrespective of the number of detected individuals, achieving a frame rate of approximately 7-8 fps on a laptop with a commercial-grade GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frank Zhang, Yibo Zhang, Quan Zheng, Rui Ma, Wei Hua, Hujun Bao, Weiwei Xu, Changqing Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation techniques have made rapid progress in recent years. Their success is mainly attributed to using existing generative models to iteratively perform image warping and inpainting to generate 3D scenes. However, these methods heavily rely on the outputs of existing models, leading to error accumulation in geometry and appearance that prevent the models from being used in various scenarios (e.g., outdoor and unreal scenarios). To address this limitation, we generatively refine the newly generated local views by querying and aggregating global 3D information, and then progressively generate the 3D scene. Specifically, we employ a tri-plane features-based NeRF as a unified representation of the 3D scene to constrain global 3D consistency, and propose a generative refinement network to synthesize new contents with higher quality by exploiting the natural image prior from 2D diffusion model as well as the global 3D information of the current scene. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, in comparison to previous methods, our approach supports wide variety of scene generation and arbitrary camera trajectories with improved visual quality and 3D consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Nguyen-Phuoc, Renald Gaboriau, Dimitri Delacroix, Laurent Navarro</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the M&M model, a novel multimodal-multitask learning framework, applied to the AVCAffe dataset for cognitive load assessment (CLA). M&M uniquely integrates audiovisual cues through a dual-pathway architecture, featuring specialized streams for audio and video inputs. A key innovation lies in its cross-modality multihead attention mechanism, fusing the different modalities for synchronized multitasking. Another notable feature is the model's three specialized branches, each tailored to a specific cognitive load label, enabling nuanced, task-specific analysis. While it shows modest performance compared to the AVCAffe's single-task baseline, M\&M demonstrates a promising framework for integrated multimodal processing. This work paves the way for future enhancements in multimodal-multitask learning systems, emphasizing the fusion of diverse data types for complex task handling.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09468">Eta Inversion: Designing an Optimal Eta Function for Diffusion-based Real Image Editing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wonjun Kang, Kevin Galim, Hyung Il Koo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in the domain of text-guided image generation and, more recently, in text-guided image editing. A commonly adopted strategy for editing real images involves inverting the diffusion process to obtain a noisy representation of the original image, which is then denoised to achieve the desired edits. However, current methods for diffusion inversion often struggle to produce edits that are both faithful to the specified text prompt and closely resemble the source image. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel and adaptable diffusion inversion technique for real image editing, which is grounded in a theoretical analysis of the role of $\eta$ in the DDIM sampling equation for enhanced editability. By designing a universal diffusion inversion method with a time- and region-dependent $\eta$ function, we enable flexible control over the editing extent. Through a comprehensive series of quantitative and qualitative assessments, involving a comparison with a broad array of recent methods, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method not only sets a new benchmark in the field but also significantly outperforms existing strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/eta-inversion</p>

Recent advancements have utilized the diffusion model and attention mechanisms to improve gesture synthesis. However, due to the high computational complexity of these techniques, generating long and diverse sequences with low latency remains a challenge. We explore the potential of state space models (SSMs) to address the challenge, implementing a two-stage modeling strategy with discrete motion priors to enhance the quality of gestures.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the unique modality of sketch for explainability, emphasising the profound impact of human strokes compared to conventional pixel-oriented studies. Beyond explanations of network behavior, we discern the genuine implications of explainability across diverse downstream sketch-related tasks. We propose a lightweight and portable explainability solution -- a seamless plugin that integrates effortlessly with any pre-trained model, eliminating the need for re-training. Demonstrating its adaptability, we present four applications: highly studied retrieval and generation, and completely novel assisted drawing and sketch adversarial attacks. The centrepiece to our solution is a stroke-level attribution map that takes different forms when linked with downstream tasks. By addressing the inherent non-differentiability of rasterisation, we enable explanations at both coarse stroke level (SLA) and partial stroke level (P-SLA), each with its advantages for specific downstream tasks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09486">SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with Spike Streams</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Chen, Shiyan Chen, Jiyuan Zhang, Baoyue Zhang, Yajing Zheng, Tiejun Huang, Zhaofei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing a sequence of sharp images from the blurry input is crucial for enhancing our insights into the captured scene and poses a significant challenge due to the limited temporal features embedded in the image. Spike cameras, sampling at rates up to 40,000 Hz, have proven effective in capturing motion features and beneficial for solving this ill-posed problem. Nonetheless, existing methods fall into the supervised learning paradigm, which suffers from notable performance degradation when applied to real-world scenarios that diverge from the synthetic training data domain. Moreover, the quality of reconstructed images is capped by the generated images based on motion analysis interpolation, which inherently differs from the actual scene, affecting the generalization ability of these methods in real high-speed scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first self-supervised framework for the task of spike-guided motion deblurring. Our approach begins with the formulation of a spike-guided deblurring model that explores the theoretical relationships among spike streams, blurry images, and their corresponding sharp sequences. We subsequently develop a self-supervised cascaded framework to alleviate the issues of spike noise and spatial-resolution mismatching encountered in the deblurring model. With knowledge distillation and re-blurring loss, we further design a lightweight deblur network to generate high-quality sequences with brightness and texture consistency with the original input. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on our real-world and synthetic datasets with spikes validate the superior generalization of the proposed framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Cai, Xinwei He, Dingkang Liang, Ao Tong, Xiang Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, large vision and language models have shown their success when adapting them to many downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a unified framework named CLIP-ADA for Anomaly Detection by Adapting a pre-trained CLIP model. To this end, we make two important improvements: 1) To acquire unified anomaly detection across industrial images of multiple categories, we introduce the learnable prompt and propose to associate it with abnormal patterns through self-supervised learning. 2) To fully exploit the representation power of CLIP, we introduce an anomaly region refinement strategy to refine the localization quality. During testing, the anomalies are localized by directly calculating the similarity between the representation of the learnable prompt and the image. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework, e.g., we achieve the state-of-the-art 97.5/55.6 and 89.3/33.1 on MVTec-AD and VisA for anomaly detection and localization. In addition, the proposed method also achieves encouraging performance with marginal training data, which is more challenging.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the comprehensive research conducted on various face analysis tasks, there is a growing interest among researchers to develop a unified approach to face perception. Existing methods mainly discuss unified representation and training, which lack task extensibility and application efficiency. To tackle this issue, we focus on the unified model structure, exploring a face generalist model. As an intuitive design, Naive Faceptor enables tasks with the same output shape and granularity to share the structural design of the standardized output head, achieving improved task extensibility. Furthermore, Faceptor is proposed to adopt a well-designed single-encoder dual-decoder architecture, allowing task-specific queries to represent new-coming semantics. This design enhances the unification of model structure while improving application efficiency in terms of storage overhead. Additionally, we introduce Layer-Attention into Faceptor, enabling the model to adaptively select features from optimal layers to perform the desired tasks. Through joint training on 13 face perception datasets, Faceptor achieves exceptional performance in facial landmark localization, face parsing, age estimation, expression recognition, binary attribute classification, and face recognition, achieving or surpassing specialized methods in most tasks. Our training framework can also be applied to auxiliary supervised learning, significantly improving performance in data-sparse tasks such as age estimation and expression recognition.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yitian Zhang, Yue Bai, Huan Wang, Yizhou Wang, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current training pipelines in object recognition neglect Hue Jittering when doing data augmentation as it not only brings appearance changes that are detrimental to classification, but also the implementation is inefficient in practice. In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the context of video recognition and find this variance to be beneficial since static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method for video recognition, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghyeok Do, Munchurl Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition, which classifies human actions based on the coordinates of joints and their connectivity within skeleton data, is widely utilized in various scenarios. While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been proposed for skeleton data represented as graphs, they suffer from limited receptive fields constrained by joint connectivity. To address this limitation, recent advancements have introduced transformer-based methods. However, capturing correlations between all joints in all frames requires substantial memory resources. To alleviate this, we propose a novel approach called Skeletal-Temporal Transformer (SkateFormer) that partitions joints and frames based on different types of skeletal-temporal relation (Skate-Type) and performs skeletal-temporal self-attention (Skate-MSA) within each partition. We categorize the key skeletal-temporal relations for action recognition into a total of four distinct types. These types combine (i) two skeletal relation types based on physically neighboring and distant joints, and (ii) two temporal relation types based on neighboring and distant frames. Through this partition-specific attention strategy, our SkateFormer can selectively focus on key joints and frames crucial for action recognition in an action-adaptive manner with efficient computation. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets validate that our SkateFormer outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evolution of text to visual components facilitates people's daily lives, such as generating image, videos from text and identifying the desired elements within the images. Computer vision models involving the multimodal abilities in the previous days are focused on image detection, classification based on well-defined objects. Large language models (LLMs) introduces the transformation from nature language to visual objects, which present the visual layout for text contexts. OpenAI GPT-4 has emerged as the pinnacle in LLMs, while the computer vision (CV) domain boasts a plethora of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and algorithms to convert 2D images to their 3D representations. However, the mismatching between the algorithms with the problem could lead to undesired results. In response to this challenge, we propose an unified VisionGPT-3D framework to consolidate the state-of-the-art vision models, thereby facilitating the development of vision-oriented AI. VisionGPT-3D provides a versatile multimodal framework building upon the strengths of multimodal foundation models. It seamlessly integrates various SOTA vision models and brings the automation in the selection of SOTA vision models, identifies the suitable 3D mesh creation algorithms corresponding to 2D depth maps analysis, generates optimal results based on diverse multimodal inputs such as text prompts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiyuan Wang, Yanzhe Liu, Shang Zhao, Rong Liu, S. Kevin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised surgical instrument segmentation with only instrument presence labels has been rarely explored in surgical domain. To mitigate the highly under-constrained challenges, we extend a two-stage weakly supervised segmentation paradigm with temporal attributes from two perspectives. From a temporal equivariance perspective, we propose a prototype-based temporal equivariance regulation loss to enhance pixel-wise consistency between adjacent features. From a semantic continuity perspective, we propose a class-aware temporal semantic continuity loss to constrain the semantic consistency between a global view of target frame and local non-discriminative regions of adjacent reference frame. To the best of our knowledge, WeakSurg is the first instrument-presence-only weakly supervised segmentation architecture to take temporal information into account for surgical scenarios. Extensive experiments are validated on Cholec80, an open benchmark for phase and instrument recognition. We annotate instance-wise instrument labels with fixed time-steps which are double checked by a clinician with 3-years experience. Our results show that WeakSurg compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods not only on semantic segmentation metrics but also on instance segmentation metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uninterrupted optical image time series are crucial for the timely monitoring of agricultural land changes. However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose a deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using a combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. We emphasize the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated time series on the detection of grassland mowing events. We focus on Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compare our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method surpasses these techniques, with an average MAE of 0.024 and R^2 of 0.92. It not only improves the accuracy of event detection tasks by employing a continuous time series, but also effectively filters out sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations that cloud masks often fail to detect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhao Gou, Kai Chen, Zhili Liu, Lanqing Hong, Hang Xu, Zhenguo Li, Dit-Yan Yeung, James T. Kwok, Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning abilities, which, however, are also more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than their LLM predecessors. Although still capable of detecting unsafe responses, we observe that safety mechanisms of the pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs can be easily bypassed due to the introduction of image features. To construct robust MLLMs, we propose ECSO(Eyes Closed, Safety On), a novel training-free protecting approach that exploits the inherent safety awareness of MLLMs, and generates safer responses via adaptively transforming unsafe images into texts to activate intrinsic safety mechanism of pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs. Experiments on five state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs demonstrate that our ECSO enhances model safety significantly (e.g., a 37.6% improvement on the MM-SafetyBench (SD+OCR), and 71.3% on VLSafe for the LLaVA-1.5-7B), while consistently maintaining utility results on common MLLM benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that ECSO can be used as a data engine to generate supervised-finetuning (SFT) data for MLLM alignment without extra human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qunjie Zhou, Maxim Maximov, Or Litany, Laura Leal-Taix\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose the use of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as a scene representation for visual localization. Recently, NeRF has been employed to enhance pose regression and scene coordinate regression models by augmenting the training database, providing auxiliary supervision through rendered images, or serving as an iterative refinement module. We extend its recognized advantages -- its ability to provide a compact scene representation with realistic appearances and accurate geometry -- by exploring the potential of NeRF's internal features in establishing precise 2D-3D matches for localization. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of NeRF's implicit knowledge, acquired through view synthesis, for matching under various conditions. This includes exploring different matching network architectures, extracting encoder features at multiple layers, and varying training configurations. Significantly, we introduce NeRFMatch, an advanced 2D-3D matching function that capitalizes on the internal knowledge of NeRF learned via view synthesis. Our evaluation of NeRFMatch on standard localization benchmarks, within a structure-based pipeline, sets a new state-of-the-art for localization performance on Cambridge Landmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiwen Huang, Songyou Peng, Dan Zhang, Andreas Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Names are essential to both human cognition and vision-language models. Open-vocabulary models utilize class names as text prompts to generalize to categories unseen during training. However, name qualities are often overlooked and lack sufficient precision in existing datasets. In this paper, we address this underexplored problem by presenting a framework for "renovating" names in open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks (RENOVATE). Through human study, we demonstrate that the names generated by our model are more precise descriptions of the visual segments and hence enhance the quality of existing datasets by means of simple renaming. We further demonstrate that using our renovated names enables training of stronger open-vocabulary segmentation models. Using open-vocabulary segmentation for name quality evaluation, we show that our renovated names lead to up to 16% relative improvement from the original names on various benchmarks across various state-of-the-art models. We provide our code and relabelings for several popular segmentation datasets (ADE20K, Cityscapes, PASCAL Context) to the research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melanie Roschewitz, Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro, Tian Xia, Galvin Khara, Ben Glocker</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive pretraining is well-known to improve downstream task performance and model generalisation, especially in limited label settings. However, it is sensitive to the choice of augmentation pipeline. Positive pairs should preserve semantic information while destroying domain-specific information. Standard augmentation pipelines emulate domain-specific changes with pre-defined photometric transformations, but what if we could simulate realistic domain changes instead? In this work, we show how to utilise recent progress in counterfactual image generation to this effect. We propose CF-SimCLR, a counterfactual contrastive learning approach which leverages approximate counterfactual inference for positive pair creation. Comprehensive evaluation across five datasets, on chest radiography and mammography, demonstrates that CF-SimCLR substantially improves robustness to acquisition shift with higher downstream performance on both in- and out-of-distribution data, particularly for domains which are under-represented during training.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In particular, we study the importance of various architecture components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data choices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, consisting of both dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoyang Wang, Xiangtai Li, Henghui Ding, Lu Qi, Jiangning Zhang, Yunhai Tong, Chen Change Loy, Shuicheng Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context segmentation has drawn more attention with the introduction of vision foundation models. Most existing approaches adopt metric learning or masked image modeling to build the correlation between visual prompts and input image queries. In this work, we explore this problem from a new perspective, using one representative generation model, the latent diffusion model (LDM). We observe a task gap between generation and segmentation in diffusion models, but LDM is still an effective minimalist for in-context segmentation. In particular, we propose two meta-architectures and correspondingly design several output alignment and optimization strategies. We have conducted comprehensive ablation studies and empirically found that the segmentation quality counts on output alignment and in-context instructions. Moreover, we build a new and fair in-context segmentation benchmark that includes both image and video datasets. Experiments validate the efficiency of our approach, demonstrating comparable or even stronger results than previous specialist models or visual foundation models. Our study shows that LDMs can also achieve good enough results for challenging in-context segmentation tasks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09620">PosSAM: Panoptic Open-vocabulary Segment Anything</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vibashan VS, Shubhankar Borse, Hyojin Park, Debasmit Das, Vishal Patel, Munawar Hayat, Fatih Porikli</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation model that effectively unifies the strengths of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the vision-language CLIP model in an end-to-end framework. While SAM excels in generating spatially-aware masks, it's decoder falls short in recognizing object class information and tends to oversegment without additional guidance. Existing approaches address this limitation by using multi-stage techniques and employing separate models to generate class-aware prompts, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks. Our proposed method, PosSAM is an end-to-end model which leverages SAM's spatially rich features to produce instance-aware masks and harnesses CLIP's semantically discriminative features for effective instance classification. Specifically, we address the limitations of SAM and propose a novel Local Discriminative Pooling (LDP) module leveraging class-agnostic SAM and class-aware CLIP features for unbiased open-vocabulary classification. Furthermore, we introduce a Mask-Aware Selective Ensembling (MASE) algorithm that adaptively enhances the quality of generated masks and boosts the performance of open-vocabulary classification during inference for each image. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate our methods strong generalization properties across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial improvements over SOTA open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation methods. In both COCO to ADE20K and ADE20K to COCO settings, PosSAM outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, 2.4 PQ and 4.6 PQ, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyu Liu, Weicong Liang, Zhanhao Liang, Chong Luo, Ji Li, Gao Huang, Yuhui Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual text rendering poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary text-to-image generation models, with the core problem lying in text encoder deficiencies. To achieve accurate text rendering, we identify two crucial requirements for text encoders: character awareness and alignment with glyphs. Our solution involves crafting a series of customized text encoder, Glyph-ByT5, by fine-tuning the character-aware ByT5 encoder using a meticulously curated paired glyph-text dataset. We present an effective method for integrating Glyph-ByT5 with SDXL, resulting in the creation of the Glyph-SDXL model for design image generation. This significantly enhances text rendering accuracy, improving it from less than $20\%$ to nearly $90\%$ on our design image benchmark. Noteworthy is Glyph-SDXL's newfound ability for text paragraph rendering, achieving high spelling accuracy for tens to hundreds of characters with automated multi-line layouts. Finally, through fine-tuning Glyph-SDXL with a small set of high-quality, photorealistic images featuring visual text, we showcase a substantial improvement in scene text rendering capabilities in open-domain real images. These compelling outcomes aim to encourage further exploration in designing customized text encoders for diverse and challenging tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anastasis Stathopoulos, Ligong Han, Dimitris Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Score-Guided Human Mesh Recovery (ScoreHMR), an approach for solving inverse problems for 3D human pose and shape reconstruction. These inverse problems involve fitting a human body model to image observations, traditionally solved through optimization techniques. ScoreHMR mimics model fitting approaches, but alignment with the image observation is achieved through score guidance in the latent space of a diffusion model. The diffusion model is trained to capture the conditional distribution of the human model parameters given an input image. By guiding its denoising process with a task-specific score, ScoreHMR effectively solves inverse problems for various applications without the need for retraining the task-agnostic diffusion model. We evaluate our approach on three settings/applications. These are: (i) single-frame model fitting; (ii) reconstruction from multiple uncalibrated views; (iii) reconstructing humans in video sequences. ScoreHMR consistently outperforms all optimization baselines on popular benchmarks across all settings. We make our code and models available at the https://statho.github.io/ScoreHMR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangfu Liu, Hanyang Wang, Weiliang Chen, Haowen Sun, Yueqi Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the strong power of 3D generation models, which offer a new level of creative flexibility by allowing users to guide the 3D content generation process through a single image or natural language. However, it remains challenging for existing 3D generation methods to create subject-driven 3D content across diverse prompts. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D customization method, dubbed Make-Your-3D that can personalize high-fidelity and consistent 3D content from only a single image of a subject with text description within 5 minutes. Our key insight is to harmonize the distributions of a multi-view diffusion model and an identity-specific 2D generative model, aligning them with the distribution of the desired 3D subject. Specifically, we design a co-evolution framework to reduce the variance of distributions, where each model undergoes a process of learning from the other through identity-aware optimization and subject-prior optimization, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality, consistent, and subject-specific 3D content with text-driven modifications that are unseen in subject image.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding videos is one of the fundamental directions in computer vision research, with extensive efforts dedicated to exploring various architectures such as RNN, 3D CNN, and Transformers. The newly proposed architecture of state space model, e.g., Mamba, shows promising traits to extend its success in long sequence modeling to video modeling. To assess whether Mamba can be a viable alternative to Transformers in the video understanding domain, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies, probing different roles Mamba can play in modeling videos, while investigating diverse tasks where Mamba could exhibit superiority. We categorize Mamba into four roles for modeling videos, deriving a Video Mamba Suite composed of 14 models/modules, and evaluating them on 12 video understanding tasks. Our extensive experiments reveal the strong potential of Mamba on both video-only and video-language tasks while showing promising efficiency-performance trade-offs. We hope this work could provide valuable data points and insights for future research on video understanding. Code is public: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/video-mamba-suite.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the first large-scale video prediction model in the autonomous driving discipline. To eliminate the restriction of high-cost data collection and empower the generalization ability of our model, we acquire massive data from the web and pair it with diverse and high-quality text descriptions. The resultant dataset accumulates over 2000 hours of driving videos, spanning areas all over the world with diverse weather conditions and traffic scenarios. Inheriting the merits from recent latent diffusion models, our model, dubbed GenAD, handles the challenging dynamics in driving scenes with novel temporal reasoning blocks. We showcase that it can generalize to various unseen driving datasets in a zero-shot manner, surpassing general or driving-specific video prediction counterparts. Furthermore, GenAD can be adapted into an action-conditioned prediction model or a motion planner, holding great potential for real-world driving applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Zhen, Xiaowen Qiu, Peihao Chen, Jincheng Yang, Xin Yan, Yilun Du, Yining Hong, Chuang Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on 2D inputs, lacking integration with the broader realm of the 3D physical world. Furthermore, they perform action prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the vast dynamics of the world and the relations between actions and dynamics. In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future scenarios to plan actions accordingly. To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model. Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based large language model (LLM), and a set of interaction tokens is introduced to engage with the embodied environment. Furthermore, to inject generation abilities into the model, we train a series of embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM for predicting the goal images and point clouds. To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets. Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodal generation, and planning capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqun Mei, Yu Zeng, He Zhang, Zhixin Shu, Xuaner Zhang, Sai Bi, Jianming Zhang, HyunJoon Jung, Vishal M. Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: At the core of portrait photography is the search for ideal lighting and viewpoint. The process often requires advanced knowledge in photography and an elaborate studio setup. In this work, we propose Holo-Relighting, a volumetric relighting method that is capable of synthesizing novel viewpoints, and novel lighting from a single image. Holo-Relighting leverages the pretrained 3D GAN (EG3D) to reconstruct geometry and appearance from an input portrait as a set of 3D-aware features. We design a relighting module conditioned on a given lighting to process these features, and predict a relit 3D representation in the form of a tri-plane, which can render to an arbitrary viewpoint through volume rendering. Besides viewpoint and lighting control, Holo-Relighting also takes the head pose as a condition to enable head-pose-dependent lighting effects. With these novel designs, Holo-Relighting can generate complex non-Lambertian lighting effects (e.g., specular highlights and cast shadows) without using any explicit physical lighting priors. We train Holo-Relighting with data captured with a light stage, and propose two data-rendering techniques to improve the data quality for training the volumetric relighting system. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate Holo-Relighting can achieve state-of-the-arts relighting quality with better photorealism, 3D consistency and controllability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyi Hong, Shilin Yan, Renrui Zhang, Wanyun Li, Xinyu Zhou, Pinxue Guo, Kaixun Jiang, Yiting Chen, Jinglun Li, Zhaoyu Chen, Wenqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual object tracking aims to localize the target object of each frame based on its initial appearance in the first frame. Depending on the input modility, tracking tasks can be divided into RGB tracking and RGB+X (e.g. RGB+N, and RGB+D) tracking. Despite the different input modalities, the core aspect of tracking is the temporal matching. Based on this common ground, we present a general framework to unify various tracking tasks, termed as OneTracker. OneTracker first performs a large-scale pre-training on a RGB tracker called Foundation Tracker. This pretraining phase equips the Foundation Tracker with a stable ability to estimate the location of the target object. Then we regard other modality information as prompt and build Prompt Tracker upon Foundation Tracker. Through freezing the Foundation Tracker and only adjusting some additional trainable parameters, Prompt Tracker inhibits the strong localization ability from Foundation Tracker and achieves parameter-efficient finetuning on downstream RGB+X tracking tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our general framework OneTracker, which is consisted of Foundation Tracker and Prompt Tracker, we conduct extensive experiments on 6 popular tracking tasks across 11 benchmarks and our OneTracker outperforms other models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan-ang Gao, Mingju Gao, Jiaju Li, Wenyi Li, Rong Zhi, Hao Tang, Hao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic image synthesis (SIS) shows good promises for sensor simulation. However, current best practices in this field, based on GANs, have not yet reached the desired level of quality. As latent diffusion models make significant strides in image generation, we are prompted to evaluate ControlNet, a notable method for its dense control capabilities. Our investigation uncovered two primary issues with its results: the presence of weird sub-structures within large semantic areas and the misalignment of content with the semantic mask. Through empirical study, we pinpointed the cause of these problems as a mismatch between the noised training data distribution and the standard normal prior applied at the inference stage. To address this challenge, we developed specific noise priors for SIS, encompassing spatial, categorical, and a novel spatial-categorical joint prior for inference. This approach, which we have named SCP-Diff, has yielded exceptional results, achieving an FID of 10.53 on Cityscapes and 12.66 on ADE20K.The code and models can be accessed via the project page.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyao Wang, Li Jiang, Xiaoyang Wu, Zhuotao Tian, Bohao Peng, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised 3D representation learning aims to learn effective representations from large-scale unlabeled point clouds. Most existing approaches adopt point discrimination as the pretext task, which assigns matched points in two distinct views as positive pairs and unmatched points as negative pairs. However, this approach often results in semantically identical points having dissimilar representations, leading to a high number of false negatives and introducing a "semantic conflict" problem. To address this issue, we propose GroupContrast, a novel approach that combines segment grouping and semantic-aware contrastive learning. Segment grouping partitions points into semantically meaningful regions, which enhances semantic coherence and provides semantic guidance for the subsequent contrastive representation learning. Semantic-aware contrastive learning augments the semantic information extracted from segment grouping and helps to alleviate the issue of "semantic conflict". We conducted extensive experiments on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks. The results demonstrate that GroupContrast learns semantically meaningful representations and achieves promising transfer learning performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work investigates the role of the emerging Analog In-memory computing (AIMC) paradigm in enabling Medical AI analysis and improving the certainty of these models at the edge. It contrasts AIMC's efficiency with traditional digital computing's limitations in power, speed, and scalability. Our comprehensive evaluation focuses on brain tumor analysis, spleen segmentation, and nuclei detection. The study highlights the superior robustness of isotropic architectures, which exhibit a minimal accuracy drop (0.04) in analog-aware training, compared to significant drops (up to 0.15) in pyramidal structures. Additionally, the paper emphasizes IMC's effective data pipelining, reducing latency and increasing throughput as well as the exploitation of inherent noise within AIMC, strategically harnessed to augment model certainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumen Basu, Mayuna Gupta, Chetan Madan, Pankaj Gupta, Chetan Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, automated Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) detection has gained the attention of researchers. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies relying on ultrasound sonography (US) images exhibit limited generalization, emphasizing the need for transformative approaches. We observe that individual US frames may lack sufficient information to capture disease manifestation. This study advocates for a paradigm shift towards video-based GBC detection, leveraging the inherent advantages of spatiotemporal representations. Employing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for representation learning, we address shortcomings in conventional image-based methods. We propose a novel design called FocusMAE to systematically bias the selection of masking tokens from high-information regions, fostering a more refined representation of malignancy. Additionally, we contribute the most extensive US video dataset for GBC detection. We also note that, this is the first study on US video-based GBC detection. We validate the proposed methods on the curated dataset, and report a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy of 96.4% for the GBC detection problem, against an accuracy of 84% by current Image-based SOTA - GBCNet, and RadFormer, and 94.7% by Video-based SOTA - AdaMAE. We further demonstrate the generality of the proposed FocusMAE on a public CT-based Covid detection dataset, reporting an improvement in accuracy by 3.3% over current baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Mishra-Sharma, Yiding Song, Jesse Thaler</p>
<p>Abstract: We present PAPERCLIP (Proposal Abstracts Provide an Effective Representation for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), a method which associates astronomical observations imaged by telescopes with natural language using a neural network model. The model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model using successful observing proposal abstracts and corresponding downstream observations, with the abstracts optionally summarized via guided generation using large language models (LLMs). Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as an example, we show that the fine-tuned model embodies a meaningful joint representation between observations and natural language through tests targeting image retrieval (i.e., finding the most relevant observations using natural language queries) and description retrieval (i.e., querying for astrophysical object classes and use cases most relevant to a given observation). Our study demonstrates the potential for using generalist foundation models rather than task-specific models for interacting with astronomical data by leveraging text as an interface.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Lin, Yamini Sri Krubha, Zhenhuan Yang, Cheng Ren, Xin Wang, Shu Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of medical imaging, particularly for COVID-19 detection, deep learning models face substantial challenges such as the necessity for extensive computational resources, the paucity of well-annotated datasets, and a significant amount of unlabeled data. In this work, we introduce the first lightweight detector designed to overcome these obstacles, leveraging a frozen CLIP image encoder and a trainable multilayer perception (MLP). Enhanced with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for robustness and a loss landscape flattening strategy for improved generalization, our model is tailored for high efficacy in COVID-19 detection. Furthermore, we integrate a teacher-student framework to capitalize on the vast amounts of unlabeled data, enabling our model to achieve superior performance despite the inherent data limitations. Experimental results on the COV19-CT-DB dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing baseline by up to 10.6% in `macro' F1 score in supervised learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiming Cui, Duygu Tosun, Reza Abbasi-Asl</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised deep learning techniques can be used to generate synthetic 7T MRIs from 3T MRI inputs. This image enhancement process leverages the advantages of ultra-high-field MRI to improve the signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios of 3T acquisitions. In this paper, we introduce multiple novel 7T synthesization algorithms based on custom-designed variants of the V-Net convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that the V-Net based model has superior performance in enhancing both single-site and multi-site MRI datasets compared to the existing benchmark model. When trained on 3T-7T MRI pairs from 8 subjects with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), our model achieves state-of-the-art 7T synthesization performance. Compared to previous works, synthetic 7T images generated from our pipeline also display superior enhancement of pathological tissue. Additionally, we implement and test a data augmentation scheme for training models that are robust to variations in the input distribution. This allows synthetic 7T models to accommodate intra-scanner and inter-scanner variability in multisite datasets. On a harmonized dataset consisting of 18 3T-7T MRI pairs from two institutions, including both healthy subjects and those with mild TBI, our model maintains its performance and can generalize to 3T MRI inputs with lower resolution. Our findings demonstrate the promise of V-Net based models for MRI enhancement and offer a preliminary probe into improving the generalizability of synthetic 7T models with data augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Lauren\c{c}on, L\'eo Tronchon, Victor Sanh</p>
<p>Abstract: Using vision-language models (VLMs) in web development presents a promising strategy to increase efficiency and unblock no-code solutions: by providing a screenshot or a sketch of a UI, a VLM could generate the code to reproduce it, for instance in a language like HTML. Despite the advancements in VLMs for various tasks, the specific challenge of converting a screenshot into a corresponding HTML has been minimally explored. We posit that this is mainly due to the absence of a suitable, high-quality dataset. This work introduces WebSight, a synthetic dataset consisting of 2 million pairs of HTML codes and their corresponding screenshots. We fine-tune a foundational VLM on our dataset and show proficiency in converting webpage screenshots to functional HTML code. To accelerate the research in this area, we open-source WebSight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Wang, Jieming Bian, Letian Zhang, Chen Chen, Jie Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative machine learning training without sharing private data. While most FL methods assume identical data domains across clients, real-world scenarios often involve heterogeneous data domains. Federated Prototype Learning (FedPL) addresses this issue, using mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However, existing FedPL methods create the same number of prototypes for each client, leading to cross-domain performance gaps and disparities for clients with varied data distributions. To mitigate cross-domain feature representation variance, we introduce FedPLVM, which establishes variance-aware dual-level prototypes clustering and employs a novel $\alpha$-sparsity prototype loss. The dual-level prototypes clustering strategy creates local clustered prototypes based on private data features, then performs global prototypes clustering to reduce communication complexity and preserve local data privacy. The $\alpha$-sparsity prototype loss aligns samples from underrepresented domains, enhancing intra-class similarity and reducing inter-class similarity. Evaluations on Digit-5, Office-10, and DomainNet datasets demonstrate our method's superiority over existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungmin Cha, Kyunghyun Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Various algorithms for continual learning (CL) have been designed with the goal of effectively alleviating the trade-off between stability and plasticity during the CL process. To achieve this goal, tuning appropriate hyperparameters for each algorithm is essential. As an evaluation protocol, it has been common practice to train a CL algorithm using diverse hyperparameter values on a CL scenario constructed with a benchmark dataset. Subsequently, the best performance attained with the optimal hyperparameter value serves as the criterion for evaluating the CL algorithm. In this paper, we contend that this evaluation protocol is not only impractical but also incapable of effectively assessing the CL capability of a CL algorithm. Returning to the fundamental principles of model evaluation in machine learning, we propose an evaluation protocol that involves Hyperparameter Tuning and Evaluation phases. Those phases consist of different datasets but share the same CL scenario. In the Hyperparameter Tuning phase, each algorithm is iteratively trained with different hyperparameter values to find the optimal hyperparameter values. Subsequently, in the Evaluation phase, the optimal hyperparameter values is directly applied for training each algorithm, and their performance in the Evaluation phase serves as the criterion for evaluating them. Through experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 based on the proposed protocol in class-incremental learning, we not only observed that the existing evaluation method fail to properly assess the CL capability of each algorithm but also observe that some recently proposed state-of-the-art algorithms, which reported superior performance, actually exhibit inferior performance compared to the previous algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Fang, Yipeng Liu, Jie Chen, Zhen Long, Ao Li, Chong-Yung Chi, Ce Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of high spatial resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) and low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) has been recognized as an effective method for HSI super-resolution (HSI-SR). However, both HSI and MSI may be acquired under extreme conditions such as night or poorly illuminating scenarios, which may cause different exposure levels, thereby seriously downgrading the yielded HSISR. In contrast to most existing methods based on respective low-light enhancements (LLIE) of MSI and HSI followed by their fusion, a deep Unfolding HSI Super-Resolution with Automatic Exposure Correction (UHSR-AEC) is proposed, that can effectively generate a high-quality fused HSI-SR (in texture and features) even under very imbalanced exposures, thanks to the correlation between LLIE and HSI-SR taken into account. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the state-of-the-art overall performance of the proposed UHSR-AEC, including comparison with some benchmark peer methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xilin Yang, Bijie Bai, Yijie Zhang, Musa Aydin, Sahan Yoruc Selcuk, Zhen Guo, Gregory A. Fishbein, Karine Atlan, William Dean Wallace, Nir Pillar, Aydogan Ozcan</p>
<p>Abstract: Systemic amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of misfolded proteins in various organs and tissues, leading to progressive organ dysfunction and failure. Congo red stain is the gold standard chemical stain for the visualization of amyloid deposits in tissue sections, as it forms complexes with the misfolded proteins and shows a birefringence pattern under polarized light microscopy. However, Congo red staining is tedious and costly to perform, and prone to false diagnoses due to variations in the amount of amyloid, staining quality and expert interpretation through manual examination of tissue under a polarization microscope. Here, we report the first demonstration of virtual birefringence imaging and virtual Congo red staining of label-free human tissue to show that a single trained neural network can rapidly transform autofluorescence images of label-free tissue sections into brightfield and polarized light microscopy equivalent images, matching the histochemically stained versions of the same samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with blind testing and pathologist evaluations on cardiac tissue where the virtually stained images agreed well with the histochemically stained ground truth images. Our virtually stained polarization and brightfield images highlight amyloid birefringence patterns in a consistent, reproducible manner while mitigating diagnostic challenges due to variations in the quality of chemical staining and manual imaging processes as part of the clinical workflow.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09101">Soften to Defend: Towards Adversarial Robustness via Self-Guided Label Refinement</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daiwei Yu, Zhuorong Li, Lina Wei, Canghong Jin, Yun Zhang, Sixian Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) is currently one of the most effective ways to obtain the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. However, most AT methods suffer from robust overfitting, i.e., a significant generalization gap in adversarial robustness between the training and testing curves. In this paper, we first identify a connection between robust overfitting and the excessive memorization of noisy labels in AT from a view of gradient norm. As such label noise is mainly caused by a distribution mismatch and improper label assignments, we are motivated to propose a label refinement approach for AT. Specifically, our Self-Guided Label Refinement first self-refines a more accurate and informative label distribution from over-confident hard labels, and then it calibrates the training by dynamically incorporating knowledge from self-distilled models into the current model and thus requiring no external teachers. Empirical results demonstrate that our method can simultaneously boost the standard accuracy and robust performance across multiple benchmark datasets, attack types, and architectures. In addition, we also provide a set of analyses from the perspectives of information theory to dive into our method and suggest the importance of soft labels for robust generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Long, Qiyuan Wang, Yazhou Ren, Yipeng Liu, Ce Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Anchor-based large-scale multi-view clustering has attracted considerable attention for its effectiveness in handling massive datasets. However, current methods mainly seek the consensus embedding feature for clustering by exploring global correlations between anchor graphs or projection matrices.In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient scalable multi-view tensor clustering (S^2MVTC) approach, where our focus is on learning correlations of embedding features within and across views. Specifically, we first construct the embedding feature tensor by stacking the embedding features of different views into a tensor and rotating it. Additionally, we build a novel tensor low-frequency approximation (TLFA) operator, which incorporates graph similarity into embedding feature learning, efficiently achieving smooth representation of embedding features within different views. Furthermore, consensus constraints are applied to embedding features to ensure inter-view semantic consistency. Experimental results on six large-scale multi-view datasets demonstrate that S^2MVTC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of clustering performance and CPU execution time, especially when handling massive data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Ustuner</p>
<p>Abstract: The high-dimensional feature space of the hyperspectral imagery poses major challenges to the processing and analysis of the hyperspectral data sets. In such a case, dimensionality reduction is necessary to decrease the computational complexity. The random projections open up new ways of dimensionality reduction, especially for large data sets. In this paper, the principal component analysis (PCA) and randomized principal component analysis (R-PCA) for the classification of hyperspectral images using support vector machines (SVM) and light gradient boosting machines (LightGBM) have been investigated. In this experimental research, the number of features was reduced to 20 and 30 for classification of two hyperspectral datasets (Indian Pines and Pavia University). The experimental results demonstrated that PCA outperformed R-PCA for SVM for both datasets, but received close accuracy values for LightGBM. The highest classification accuracies were obtained as 0.9925 and 0.9639 by LightGBM with original features for the Pavia University and Indian Pines, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lipei Zhang, Yanqi Cheng, Lihao Liu, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved brain tumour segmentation techniques; however, the results still lack confidence and robustness as they solely consider image data without biophysical priors or pathological information. Integrating biophysics-informed regularisation is one effective way to change this situation, as it provides an prior regularisation for automated end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that designs brain tumour growth Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models as a regularisation with deep learning, operational with any network model. Our method introduces tumour growth PDE models directly into the segmentation process, improving accuracy and robustness, especially in data-scarce scenarios. This system estimates tumour cell density using a periodic activation function. By effectively integrating this estimation with biophysical models, we achieve a better capture of tumour characteristics. This approach not only aligns the segmentation closer to actual biological behaviour but also strengthens the model's performance under limited data conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on the BraTS 2023 dataset, showcasing significant improvements in both precision and reliability of tumour segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of medical image segmentation, models based on both CNN and Transformer have been thoroughly investigated. However, CNNs have limited modeling capabilities for long-range dependencies, making it challenging to exploit the semantic information within images fully. On the other hand, the quadratic computational complexity poses a challenge for Transformers. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have been recognized as a promising method. They not only demonstrate superior performance in modeling long-range interactions, but also preserve a linear computational complexity. Inspired by the Mamba architecture, We proposed Vison Mamba-UNetV2, the Visual State Space (VSS) Block is introduced to capture extensive contextual information, the Semantics and Detail Infusion (SDI) is introduced to augment the infusion of low-level and high-level features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, CVC-ColonDB and ETIS-LaribPolypDB public datasets.

<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative models have demonstrated impressive capacity in producing visually compelling images, with increasing applications in medical imaging. However, they continue to grapple with the challenge of image hallucination and the generation of anatomically inaccurate outputs. These limitations are mainly due to the sole reliance on textual inputs and lack of spatial control over the generated images, hindering the potential usefulness of such models in real-life settings. We present XReal, a novel controllable diffusion model for generating realistic chest X-ray images through precise anatomy and pathology location control. Our lightweight method can seamlessly integrate spatial control in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without fine-tuning, retaining its existing knowledge while enhancing its generation capabilities. XReal outperforms state-of-the-art x-ray diffusion models in quantitative and qualitative metrics while showing 13% and 10% anatomy and pathology realism gain, respectively, based on the expert radiologist evaluation. Our model holds promise for advancing generative models in medical imaging, offering greater precision and adaptability while inviting further exploration in this evolving field.

<p>Abstract: Automated segmentation proves to be a valuable tool in precisely detecting tumors within medical images. The accurate identification and segmentation of tumor types hold paramount importance in diagnosing, monitoring, and treating highly fatal brain tumors. The BraTS challenge serves as a platform for researchers to tackle this issue by participating in open challenges focused on tumor segmentation. This study outlines our methodology for segmenting tumors in the context of two distinct tasks from the BraTS 2023 challenge: Adult Glioma and Pediatric Tumors. Our approach leverages two encoder-decoder-based CNN models, namely SegResNet and MedNeXt, for segmenting three distinct subregions of tumors. We further introduce a set of robust postprocessing to improve the segmentation, especially for the newly introduced BraTS 2023 metrics. The specifics of our approach and comprehensive performance analyses are expounded upon in this work. Our proposed approach achieves third place in the BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma Segmentation Challenges with an average of 0.8313 and 36.38 Dice and HD95 scores on the test set, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stain normalization algorithms aim to transform the color and intensity characteristics of a source multi-gigapixel histology image to match those of a target image, mitigating inconsistencies in the appearance of stains used to highlight cellular components in the images. We propose a new approach, StainFuser, which treats this problem as a style transfer task using a novel Conditional Latent Diffusion architecture, eliminating the need for handcrafted color components. With this method, we curate SPI-2M the largest stain normalization dataset to date of over 2 million histology images with neural style transfer for high-quality transformations. Trained on this data, StainFuser outperforms current state-of-the-art GAN and handcrafted methods in terms of the quality of normalized images. Additionally, compared to existing approaches, it improves the performance of nuclei instance segmentation and classification models when used as a test time augmentation method on the challenging CoNIC dataset. Finally, we apply StainFuser on multi-gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and demonstrate improved performance in terms of computational efficiency, image quality and consistency across tiles over current methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Cai, Hao Chen, Kwang-Ting Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal findings using only normal training data, playing a crucial role in health screening and recognizing rare diseases. Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those utilizing autoencoders (AEs), are dominant in this field. They work under the assumption that AEs trained on only normal data cannot reconstruct unseen abnormal regions well, thereby enabling the anomaly detection based on reconstruction errors. However, this assumption does not always hold due to the mismatch between the reconstruction training objective and the anomaly detection task objective, rendering these methods theoretically unsound. This study focuses on providing a theoretical foundation for AE-based reconstruction methods in anomaly detection. By leveraging information theory, we elucidate the principles of these methods and reveal that the key to improving AE in anomaly detection lies in minimizing the information entropy of latent vectors. Experiments on four datasets with two image modalities validate the effectiveness of our theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to theoretically clarify the principles and design philosophy of AE for anomaly detection. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyu Chen, Zhixiu Hao, Lin Guo, Liying Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) image reconstruction is a promising approach to reduce radiation exposure, but it inevitably leads to image degradation. Although diffusion model-based approaches are computationally expensive and suffer from the training-sampling discrepancy, they provide a potential solution to the problem. This study introduces a novel Cascaded Diffusion with Discrepancy Mitigation (CDDM) framework, including the low-quality image generation in latent space and the high-quality image generation in pixel space which contains data consistency and discrepancy mitigation in a one-step reconstruction process. The cascaded framework minimizes computational costs by moving some inference steps from pixel space to latent space. The discrepancy mitigation technique addresses the training-sampling gap induced by data consistency, ensuring the data distribution is close to the original manifold. A specialized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is employed to process image gradients in separate directions, offering a more targeted approach to regularization. Experimental results across two datasets demonstrate CDDM's superior performance in high-quality image generation with clearer boundaries compared to existing methods, highlighting the framework's computational efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Dynamic Range (DR) is a pivotal characteristic of imaging systems. Current frame-based cameras struggle to achieve high dynamic range imaging due to the conflict between globally uniform exposure and spatially variant scene illumination. In this paper, we propose AsynHDR, a Pixel-Asynchronous HDR imaging system, based on key insights into the challenges in HDR imaging and the unique event-generating mechanism of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). Our proposed AsynHDR system integrates the DVS with a set of LCD panels. The LCD panels modulate the irradiance incident upon the DVS by altering their transparency, thereby triggering the pixel-independent event streams. The HDR image is subsequently decoded from the event streams through our temporal-weighted algorithm. Experiments under standard test platform and several challenging scenes have verified the feasibility of the system in HDR imaging task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures on MRI is the primary step for further quantitative analysis of brain diseases. Manual segmentation is still considered the gold standard in terms of accuracy; however, such data is extremely time-consuming to generate. This paper presents a deep learning-based segmentation approach for 12 deep-brain structures, utilizing multiple region-based U-Nets. The brain is divided into three focal regions of interest that encompass the brainstem, the ventricular system, and the striatum. Next, three region-based U-nets are run in parallel to parcellate these larger structures into their respective four substructures. This approach not only greatly reduces the training and processing times but also significantly enhances the segmentation accuracy, compared to segmenting the entire MRI image at once. Our approach achieves remarkable accuracy with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.901 and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 1.155 mm. The method was compared with state-of-the-art segmentation approaches, demonstrating a high level of accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09559">Less is More: Data Value Estimation for Visual Instruction Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zikang Liu, Kun Zhou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Dawei Gao, Yaliang Li, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in vision scenario. However, existing MLLMs mostly rely on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy. To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction dataset even do not affect the performance. Based on the findings, we propose a new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual instruction data. TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value of the visual instructions based on computed gradients. Then, according to the estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual instruction subset for training. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks. Our code and data will be publicly released.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09635">Transformers Get Stable: An End-to-End Signal Propagation Theory for Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhil Kedia, Mohd Abbas Zaidi, Sushil Khyalia, Jungho Jung, Harshith Goka, Haejun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In spite of their huge success, transformer models remain difficult to scale in depth. In this work, we develop a unified signal propagation theory and provide formulae that govern the moments of the forward and backward signal through the transformer model. Our framework can be used to understand and mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients, rank collapse, and instability associated with high attention scores. We also propose DeepScaleLM, an initialization and scaling scheme that conserves unit output/gradient moments throughout the model, enabling the training of very deep models with 100s of layers. We find that transformer models could be much deeper - our deep models with fewer parameters outperform shallow models in Language Modeling, Speech Translation, and Image Classification, across Encoder-only, Decoder-only and Encoder-Decoder variants, for both Pre-LN and Post-LN transformers, for multiple datasets and model sizes. These improvements also translate into improved performance on downstream Question Answering tasks and improved robustness for image classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing a 3D scene capable of accommodating open-ended language queries, is a pivotal pursuit, particularly within the domain of robotics. Such technology facilitates robots in executing object manipulations based on human language directives. To tackle this challenge, some research efforts have been dedicated to the development of language-embedded implicit fields. However, implicit fields (e.g. NeRF) encounter limitations due to the necessity of processing a large number of input views for reconstruction, coupled with their inherent inefficiencies in inference. Thus, we present the GaussianGrasper, which utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to explicitly represent the scene as a collection of Gaussian primitives. Our approach takes a limited set of RGB-D views and employs a tile-based splatting technique to create a feature field. In particular, we propose an Efficient Feature Distillation (EFD) module that employs contrastive learning to efficiently and accurately distill language embeddings derived from foundational models. With the reconstructed geometry of the Gaussian field, our method enables the pre-trained grasping model to generate collision-free grasp pose candidates. Furthermore, we propose a normal-guided grasp module to select the best grasp pose. Through comprehensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate that GaussianGrasper enables robots to accurately query and grasp objects with language instructions, providing a new solution for language-guided manipulation tasks.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08614">Deep Adaptation of Adult-Child Facial Expressions by Fusing Landmark Features</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Megan A. Witherow, Manar D. Samad, Norou Diawara, Haim Y. Bar, Khan M. Iftekharuddin</p>
<p>Abstract: Imaging of facial affects may be used to measure psychophysiological attributes of children through their adulthood for applications in education, healthcare, and entertainment, among others. Deep convolutional neural networks show promising results in classifying facial expressions of adults. However, classifier models trained with adult benchmark data are unsuitable for learning child expressions due to discrepancies in psychophysical development. Similarly, models trained with child data perform poorly in adult expression classification. We propose domain adaptation to concurrently align distributions of adult and child expressions in a shared latent space for robust classification of either domain. Furthermore, age variations in facial images are studied in age-invariant face recognition yet remain unleveraged in adult-child expression classification. We take inspiration from multiple fields and propose deep adaptive FACial Expressions fusing BEtaMix SElected Landmark Features (FACE-BE-SELF) for adult-child expression classification. For the first time in the literature, a mixture of Beta distributions is used to decompose and select facial features based on correlations with expression, domain, and identity factors. We evaluate FACE-BE-SELF using 5-fold cross validation for two pairs of adult-child data sets. Our proposed FACE-BE-SELF approach outperforms transfer learning and other baseline domain adaptation methods in aligning latent representations of adult and child expressions.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11257">Computational Imaging for Machine Perception: Transferring Semantic Segmentation beyond Aberrations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Jiang, Hao Shi, Shaohua Gao, Jiaming Zhang, Kailun Yang, Lei Sun, Huajian Ni, Kaiwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic scene understanding with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS) in mobile and wearable applications remains a challenge due to the corrupted imaging quality induced by optical aberrations. However, previous works only focus on improving the subjective imaging quality through the Computational Imaging (CI) technique, ignoring the feasibility of advancing semantic segmentation. In this paper, we pioneer the investigation of Semantic Segmentation under Optical Aberrations (SSOA) with MOS. To benchmark SSOA, we construct Virtual Prototype Lens (VPL) groups through optical simulation, generating Cityscapes-ab and KITTI-360-ab datasets under different behaviors and levels of aberrations. We look into SSOA via an unsupervised domain adaptation perspective to address the scarcity of labeled aberration data in real-world scenarios. Further, we propose Computational Imaging Assisted Domain Adaptation (CIADA) to leverage prior knowledge of CI for robust performance in SSOA. Based on our benchmark, we conduct experiments on the robustness of classical segmenters against aberrations. In addition, extensive evaluations of possible solutions to SSOA reveal that CIADA achieves superior performance under all aberration distributions, bridging the gap between computational imaging and downstream applications for MOS.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11612">Plug and Play Active Learning for Object Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhongyi Yang, Lichao Huang, Elliot J. Crowley</p>
<p>Abstract: Annotating datasets for object detection is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. To minimize this burden, active learning (AL) techniques are employed to select the most informative samples for annotation within a constrained "annotation budget". Traditional AL strategies typically rely on model uncertainty or sample diversity for query sampling, while more advanced methods have focused on developing AL-specific object detector architectures to enhance performance. However, these specialized approaches are not readily adaptable to different object detectors due to the significant engineering effort required for integration. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Plug and Play Active Learning (PPAL), a simple and effective AL strategy for object detection. PPAL is a two-stage method comprising uncertainty-based and diversity-based sampling phases. In the first stage, our Difficulty Calibrated Uncertainty Sampling leverage a category-wise difficulty coefficient that combines both classification and localisation difficulties to re-weight instance uncertainties, from which we sample a candidate pool for the subsequent diversity-based sampling. In the second stage, we propose Category Conditioned Matching Similarity to better compute the similarities of multi-instance images as ensembles of their instance similarities, which is used by the k-Means++ algorithm to sample the final AL queries. PPAL makes no change to model architectures or detector training pipelines; hence it can be easily generalized to different object detectors. We benchmark PPAL on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets using different detector architectures and show that our method outperforms prior work by a large margin.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00394">Deep Learning Technique for Human Parsing: A Survey and Outlook</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Yang, Wenhe Jia, Shan Li, Qing Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Human parsing aims to partition humans in image or video into multiple pixel-level semantic parts. In the last decade, it has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community and has been utilized in a broad range of practical applications, from security monitoring, to social media, to visual special effects, just to name a few. Although deep learning-based human parsing solutions have made remarkable achievements, many important concepts, existing challenges, and potential research directions are still confusing. In this survey, we comprehensively review three core sub-tasks: single human parsing, multiple human parsing, and video human parsing, by introducing their respective task settings, background concepts, relevant problems and applications, representative literature, and datasets. We also present quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed methods on benchmark datasets. Additionally, to promote sustainable development of the community, we put forward a transformer-based human parsing framework, providing a high-performance baseline for follow-up research through universal, concise, and extensible solutions. Finally, we point out a set of under-investigated open issues in this field and suggest new directions for future study.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06072">Actional Atomic-Concept Learning for Demystifying Vision-Language Navigation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingqian Lin, Yi Zhu, Xiaodan Liang, Liang Lin, Jianzhuang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task which requires an agent to align complex visual observations to language instructions to reach the goal position. Most existing VLN agents directly learn to align the raw directional features and visual features trained using one-hot labels to linguistic instruction features. However, the big semantic gap among these multi-modal inputs makes the alignment difficult and therefore limits the navigation performance. In this paper, we propose Actional Atomic-Concept Learning (AACL), which maps visual observations to actional atomic concepts for facilitating the alignment. Specifically, an actional atomic concept is a natural language phrase containing an atomic action and an object, e.g., ``go up stairs''. These actional atomic concepts, which serve as the bridge between observations and instructions, can effectively mitigate the semantic gap and simplify the alignment. AACL contains three core components: 1) a concept mapping module to map the observations to the actional atomic concept representations through the VLN environment and the recently proposed Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, 2) a concept refining adapter to encourage more instruction-oriented object concept extraction by re-ranking the predicted object concepts by CLIP, and 3) an observation co-embedding module which utilizes concept representations to regularize the observation representations. Our AACL establishes new state-of-the-art results on both fine-grained (R2R) and high-level (REVERIE and R2R-Last) VLN benchmarks. Moreover, the visualization shows that AACL significantly improves the interpretability in action decision.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04276">AdaptiveClick: Clicks-aware Transformer with Adaptive Focal Loss for Interactive Image Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Lin, Jiajun Chen, Kailun Yang, Alina Roitberg, Siyu Li, Zhiyong Li, Shutao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) has emerged as a promising technique for decreasing annotation time. Substantial progress has been made in pre- and post-processing for IIS, but the critical issue of interaction ambiguity, notably hindering segmentation quality, has been under-researched. To address this, we introduce AdaptiveClick -- a click-aware transformer incorporating an adaptive focal loss that tackles annotation inconsistencies with tools for mask- and pixel-level ambiguity resolution. To the best of our knowledge, AdaptiveClick is the first transformer-based, mask-adaptive segmentation framework for IIS. The key ingredient of our method is the Click-Aware Mask-adaptive transformer Decoder (CAMD), which enhances the interaction between click and image features. Additionally, AdaptiveClick enables pixel-adaptive differentiation of hard and easy samples in the decision space, independent of their varying distributions. This is primarily achieved by optimizing a generalized Adaptive Focal Loss (AFL) with a theoretical guarantee, where two adaptive coefficients control the ratio of gradient values for hard and easy pixels. Our analysis reveals that the commonly used Focal and BCE losses can be considered special cases of the proposed AFL. With a plain ViT backbone, extensive experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdaptiveClick compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07280">Controlling Text-to-Image Diffusion by Orthogonal Finetuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu, Haiwen Feng, Yuxuan Xue, Yao Feng, Zhen Liu, Dan Zhang, Adrian Weller, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: Large text-to-image diffusion models have impressive capabilities in generating photorealistic images from text prompts. How to effectively guide or control these powerful models to perform different downstream tasks becomes an important open problem. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a principled finetuning method -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT), for adapting text-to-image diffusion models to downstream tasks. Unlike existing methods, OFT can provably preserve hyperspherical energy which characterizes the pairwise neuron relationship on the unit hypersphere. We find that this property is crucial for preserving the semantic generation ability of text-to-image diffusion models. To improve finetuning stability, we further propose Constrained Orthogonal Finetuning (COFT) which imposes an additional radius constraint to the hypersphere. Specifically, we consider two important finetuning text-to-image tasks: subject-driven generation where the goal is to generate subject-specific images given a few images of a subject and a text prompt, and controllable generation where the goal is to enable the model to take in additional control signals. We empirically show that our OFT framework outperforms existing methods in generation quality and convergence speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiwen Liang, Liang Ma, Shanshan Guo, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Shikui Ma, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and following natural language instructions while navigating through complex, real-world environments poses a significant challenge for general-purpose robots. These environments often include obstacles and pedestrians, making it essential for autonomous agents to possess the capability of self-corrected planning to adjust their actions based on feedback from the surroundings. However, the majority of existing vision-and-language navigation (VLN) methods primarily operate in less realistic simulator settings and do not incorporate environmental feedback into their decision-making processes. To address this gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot framework called CorNav, utilizing a large language model for decision-making and comprising two key components: 1) incorporating environmental feedback for refining future plans and adjusting its actions, and 2) multiple domain experts for parsing instructions, scene understanding, and refining predicted actions. In addition to the framework, we develop a 3D simulator that renders realistic scenarios using Unreal Engine 5. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of navigation agents in a zero-shot multi-task setting, we create a benchmark called NavBench. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CorNav consistently outperforms all baselines by a significant margin across all tasks. On average, CorNav achieves a success rate of 28.1\%, surpassing the best baseline's performance of 20.5\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world weather conditions are intricate and often occur concurrently. However, most existing restoration approaches are limited in their applicability to specific weather conditions in training data and struggle to generalize to unseen weather types, including real-world weather conditions.To address this issue, we introduce MetaWeather, a universal approach that can handle diverse and novel weather conditions with a single unified model. Extending a powerful meta-learning framework, MetaWeather formulates the task of weather-degraded image restoration as a few-shot adaptation problem that predicts the degradation pattern of a query image, and learns to adapt to unseen weather conditions through a novel spatial-channel matching algorithm. Experimental results on the BID Task II.A, SPA-Data, and RealSnow datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to unseen weather conditions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-weather image restoration methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14469">Pixel-Aware Stable Diffusion for Realistic Image Super-resolution and Personalized Stylization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Yang, Rongyuan Wu, Peiran Ren, Xuansong Xie, Lei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in various image generation, editing, enhancement and translation tasks. In particular, the pre-trained text-to-image stable diffusion models provide a potential solution to the challenging realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and image stylization problems with their strong generative priors. However, the existing methods along this line often fail to keep faithful pixel-wise image structures. If extra skip connections are used to reproduce details, additional training in image space will be required, limiting the application to tasks in latent space such as image stylization. In this work, we propose a pixel-aware stable diffusion (PASD) network to achieve robust Real-ISR and personalized image stylization. Specifically, a pixel-aware cross attention module is introduced to enable diffusion models perceiving image local structures in pixel-wise level, while a degradation removal module is used to extract degradation insensitive features to guide the diffusion process together with image high level information. An adjustable noise schedule is introduced to further improve the image restoration results. By simply replacing the base diffusion model with a stylized one, PASD can generate diverse stylized images without collecting pairwise training data, and by shifting the base model with an aesthetic one, PASD can bring old photos back to life. Extensive experiments in a variety of image enhancement and stylization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PASD approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aliasghar Khani, Saeid Asgari Taghanaki, Aditya Sanghi, Ali Mahdavi Amiri, Ghassan Hamarneh</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant strides have been made using large vision-language models, like Stable Diffusion (SD), for a variety of downstream tasks, including image editing, image correspondence, and 3D shape generation. Inspired by these advancements, we explore leveraging these extensive vision-language models for segmenting images at any desired granularity using as few as one annotated sample by proposing SLiMe. SLiMe frames this problem as an optimization task. Specifically, given a single training image and its segmentation mask, we first extract attention maps, including our novel "weighted accumulated self-attention map" from the SD prior. Then, using the extracted attention maps, the text embeddings of Stable Diffusion are optimized such that, each of them, learn about a single segmented region from the training image. These learned embeddings then highlight the segmented region in the attention maps, which in turn can then be used to derive the segmentation map. This enables SLiMe to segment any real-world image during inference with the granularity of the segmented region in the training image, using just one example. Moreover, leveraging additional training data when available, i.e. few-shot, improves the performance of SLiMe. We carried out a knowledge-rich set of experiments examining various design factors and showed that SLiMe outperforms other existing one-shot and few-shot segmentation methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10491">DCPT: Darkness Clue-Prompted Tracking in Nighttime UAVs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawen Zhu, Huayi Tang, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Jun-Yan He, Bin Luo, Shihao Qiu, Shengming Li, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing nighttime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trackers follow an "Enhance-then-Track" architecture - first using a light enhancer to brighten the nighttime video, then employing a daytime tracker to locate the object. This separate enhancement and tracking fails to build an end-to-end trainable vision system. To address this, we propose a novel architecture called Darkness Clue-Prompted Tracking (DCPT) that achieves robust UAV tracking at night by efficiently learning to generate darkness clue prompts. Without a separate enhancer, DCPT directly encodes anti-dark capabilities into prompts using a darkness clue prompter (DCP). Specifically, DCP iteratively learns emphasizing and undermining projections for darkness clues. It then injects these learned visual prompts into a daytime tracker with fixed parameters across transformer layers. Moreover, a gated feature aggregation mechanism enables adaptive fusion between prompts and between prompts and the base model. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance for DCPT on multiple dark scenario benchmarks. The unified end-to-end learning of enhancement and tracking in DCPT enables a more trainable system. The darkness clue prompting efficiently injects anti-dark knowledge without extra modules.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Huang, Yihan Zeng, Bowen Dong, Hang Xu, Songcen Xu, Rynson W. H. Lau, Wangmeng Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works learn 3D representation explicitly under text-3D guidance. However, limited text-3D data restricts the vocabulary scale and text control of generations. Generators may easily fall into a stereotype concept for certain text prompts, thus losing open-vocabulary generation ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a conditional 3D generative model, namely TextField3D. Specifically, rather than using the text prompts as input directly, we suggest to inject dynamic noise into the latent space of given text prompts, i.e., Noisy Text Fields (NTFs). In this way, limited 3D data can be mapped to the appropriate range of textual latent space that is expanded by NTFs. To this end, an NTFGen module is proposed to model general text latent code in noisy fields. Meanwhile, an NTFBind module is proposed to align view-invariant image latent code to noisy fields, further supporting image-conditional 3D generation. To guide the conditional generation in both geometry and texture, multi-modal discrimination is constructed with a text-3D discriminator and a text-2.5D discriminator. Compared to previous methods, TextField3D includes three merits: 1) large vocabulary, 2) text consistency, and 3) low latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a potential open-vocabulary 3D generation capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keivan Rezaei, Mehrdad Saberi, Mazda Moayeri, Soheil Feizi</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the challenge of providing human-understandable descriptions for failure modes in trained image classification models. Existing works address this problem by first identifying clusters (or directions) of incorrectly classified samples in a latent space and then aiming to provide human-understandable text descriptions for them. We observe that in some cases, describing text does not match well with identified failure modes, partially owing to the fact that shared interpretable attributes of failure modes may not be captured using clustering in the feature space. To improve on these shortcomings, we propose a novel approach that prioritizes interpretability in this problem: we start by obtaining human-understandable concepts (tags) of images in the dataset and then analyze the model's behavior based on the presence or absence of combinations of these tags. Our method also ensures that the tags describing a failure mode form a minimal set, avoiding redundant and noisy descriptions. Through several experiments on different datasets, we show that our method successfully identifies failure modes and generates high-quality text descriptions associated with them. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing interpretability in understanding model failures.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00390">InstructCV: Instruction-Tuned Text-to-Image Diffusion Models as Vision Generalists</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulu Gan, Sungwoo Park, Alexander Schubert, Anthony Philippakis, Ahmed M. Alaa</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative diffusion models have enabled text-controlled synthesis of realistic and diverse images with impressive quality. Despite these remarkable advances, the application of text-to-image generative models in computer vision for standard visual recognition tasks remains limited. The current de facto approach for these tasks is to design model architectures and loss functions that are tailored to the task at hand. In this paper, we develop a unified language interface for computer vision tasks that abstracts away task-specific design choices and enables task execution by following natural language instructions. Our approach involves casting multiple computer vision tasks as text-to-image generation problems. Here, the text represents an instruction describing the task, and the resulting image is a visually-encoded task output. To train our model, we pool commonly-used computer vision datasets covering a range of tasks, including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and classification. We then use a large language model to paraphrase prompt templates that convey the specific tasks to be conducted on each image, and through this process, we create a multi-modal and multi-task training dataset comprising input and output images along with annotated instructions. Following the InstructPix2Pix architecture, we apply instruction-tuning to a text-to-image diffusion model using our constructed dataset, steering its functionality from a generative model to an instruction-guided multi-task vision learner. Experiments demonstrate that our model, dubbed InstructCV, performs competitively compared to other generalist and task-specific vision models. Moreover, it exhibits compelling generalization capabilities to unseen data, categories, and user instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhua Xu, Yujia Zhang, Enze Xie, Zhen Zhao, Yong Guo, Kwan-Yee. K. Wong, Zhenguo Li, Hengshuang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a prominent area of interest within the research community, given their proficiency in handling and reasoning with non-textual data, including images and videos. This study seeks to extend the application of MLLMs to the realm of autonomous driving by introducing DriveGPT4, a novel interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving system based on LLMs. Capable of processing multi-frame video inputs and textual queries, DriveGPT4 facilitates the interpretation of vehicle actions, offers pertinent reasoning, and effectively addresses a diverse range of questions posed by users. Furthermore, DriveGPT4 predicts low-level vehicle control signals in an end-to-end fashion. These advanced capabilities are achieved through the utilization of a bespoke visual instruction tuning dataset, specifically tailored for autonomous driving applications, in conjunction with a mix-finetuning training strategy. DriveGPT4 represents the pioneering effort to leverage LLMs for the development of an interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving solution. Evaluations conducted on the BDD-X dataset showcase the superior qualitative and quantitative performance of DriveGPT4. Additionally, the fine-tuning of domain-specific data enables DriveGPT4 to yield close or even improved results in terms of autonomous driving grounding when contrasted with GPT4-V. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04747">Towards Dynamic and Small Objects Refinement for Unsupervised Domain Adaptative Nighttime Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Pan, Sihang Li, Yucheng Chen, Jinjing Zhu, Lin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Nighttime semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in practical applications, such as autonomous driving, where it frequently encounters difficulties caused by inadequate illumination conditions and the absence of well-annotated datasets. Moreover, semantic segmentation models trained on daytime datasets often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to nighttime conditions. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has shown the potential to address the challenges and achieved remarkable results for nighttime semantic segmentation. However, existing methods still face limitations in 1) their reliance on style transfer or relighting models, which struggle to generalize to complex nighttime environments, and 2) their ignorance of dynamic and small objects like vehicles and poles, which are difficult to be directly learned from other domains. This paper proposes a novel UDA method that refines both label and feature levels for dynamic and small objects for nighttime semantic segmentation. First, we propose a dynamic and small object refinement module to complement the knowledge of dynamic and small objects from the source domain to target the nighttime domain. These dynamic and small objects are normally context-inconsistent in under-exposed conditions. Then, we design a feature prototype alignment module to reduce the domain gap by deploying contrastive learning between features and prototypes of the same class from different domains, while re-weighting the categories of dynamic and small objects. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior arts by a large margin for nighttime segmentation. Project page: https://rorisis.github.io/DSRNSS/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengfeng Lai, Haotian Zhang, Bowen Zhang, Wentao Wu, Haoping Bai, Aleksei Timofeev, Xianzhi Du, Zhe Gan, Jiulong Shan, Chen-Nee Chuah, Yinfei Yang, Meng Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale web-crawled datasets are fundamental for the success of pre-training vision-language models, such as CLIP. However, the inherent noise and potential irrelevance of web-crawled AltTexts pose challenges in achieving precise image-text alignment. Existing methods utilizing large language models (LLMs) for caption rewriting have shown promise on small, curated datasets like CC3M and CC12M. This study introduces a scalable pipeline for noisy caption rewriting. Unlike recent LLM rewriting techniques, we emphasize the incorporation of visual concepts into captions, termed as Visual-enriched Captions (VeCap). To ensure data diversity, we propose a novel mixed training scheme that optimizes the utilization of AltTexts alongside newly generated VeCap. We showcase the adaptation of this method for training CLIP on large-scale web-crawled datasets, termed VeCLIP. Employing this cost-effective pipeline, we effortlessly scale our dataset up to 300 million samples named VeCap dataset. Our results show significant advantages in image-text alignment and overall model performance. For example, VeCLIP achieves up to +25.2% gain in COCO and Flickr30k retrieval tasks under the 12M setting. For data efficiency, VeCLIP achieves +3% gain while only using 14% of the data employed in the vanilla CLIP and 11% in ALIGN. We also note the VeCap data is complementary with other well curated datasets good for zero-shot classification tasks. When combining VeCap and DFN, our model can achieve strong performance on both of image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks, e.g. 83.1% accuracy@1 on ImageNet zero-shot for a H/14 model.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09883">Zero-Shot Object Goal Visual Navigation With Class-Independent Relationship Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinting Li, Shiguang Zhang, Yue LU, Kerry Dang, Lingyan Ran</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the zero-shot object goal visual navigation problem. In the object goal visual navigation task, the agent needs to locate navigation targets from its egocentric visual input. "Zero-shot" means that the target the agent needs to find is not trained during the training phase. To address the issue of coupling navigation ability with target features during training, we propose the Class-Independent Relationship Network (CIRN). This method combines target detection information with the relative semantic similarity between the target and the navigation target, and constructs a brand new state representation based on similarity ranking, this state representation does not include target feature or environment feature, effectively decoupling the agent's navigation ability from target features. And a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is employed to learn the relationships between different objects based on their similarities. During testing, our approach demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, including zero-shot navigation tasks with different targets and environments. Through extensive experiments in the AI2-THOR virtual environment, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches in the zero-shot object goal visual navigation task. Furthermore, we conducted experiments in more challenging cross-target and cross-scene settings, which further validate the robustness and generalization ability of our method.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11482">Rethinking Class-incremental Learning in the Era of Large Pre-trained Models via Test-Time Adaptation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Imad Eddine Marouf, Subhankar Roy, Enzo Tartaglione, St\'ephane Lathuili\`ere</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) is a challenging task that involves sequentially learning to categorize classes from new tasks without forgetting previously learned information. The advent of large pre-trained models (PTMs) has fast-tracked the progress in CIL due to the highly transferable PTM representations, where tuning a small set of parameters leads to state-of-the-art performance when compared with the traditional CIL methods that are trained from scratch. However, repeated fine-tuning on each task destroys the rich representations of the PTMs and further leads to forgetting previous tasks. To strike a balance between the stability and plasticity of PTMs for CIL, we propose a novel perspective of eliminating training on every new task and instead train PTM only on the first task, and then refine its representation at inference time using test-time adaptation (TTA). Concretely, we propose Test-Time Adaptation for Class-Incremental Learning (TTACIL) that first fine-tunes PTMs using Adapters on the first task, then adjusts Layer Norm parameters of the PTM on each test instance for learning task-specific features, and finally resets them back to the adapted model to preserve stability. As a consequence, our TTACIL does not undergo any forgetting, while benefiting each task with the rich PTM features. Additionally, by design, our TTACIL is robust to common data corruptions. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art CIL methods when evaluated on multiple CIL benchmarks under both clean and corrupted data. Code is available at: https://github.com/IemProg/TTACIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Chen, Zheyuan Li, Yuandong Pu, Yihao Liu, Jiantao Zhou, Yu Qiao, Chao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant progress made by deep models in various image restoration tasks, existing image restoration networks still face challenges in terms of task generality. An intuitive manifestation is that networks which excel in certain tasks often fail to deliver satisfactory results in others. To illustrate this point, we select five representative networks and conduct a comparative study on five classic image restoration tasks. First, we provide a detailed explanation of the characteristics of different image restoration tasks and backbone networks. Following this, we present the benchmark results and analyze the reasons behind the performance disparity of different models across various tasks. Drawing from this comparative study, we propose that a general image restoration backbone network needs to meet the functional requirements of diverse tasks. Based on this principle, we design a new general image restoration backbone network, X-Restormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Restormer possesses good task generality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18235">Davidsonian Scene Graph: Improving Reliability in Fine-grained Evaluation for Text-to-Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemin Cho, Yushi Hu, Roopal Garg, Peter Anderson, Ranjay Krishna, Jason Baldridge, Mohit Bansal, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Su Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image models is notoriously difficult. A strong recent approach for assessing text-image faithfulness is based on QG/A (question generation and answering), which uses pre-trained foundational models to automatically generate a set of questions and answers from the prompt, and output images are scored based on whether these answers extracted with a visual question answering model are consistent with the prompt-based answers. This kind of evaluation is naturally dependent on the quality of the underlying QG and VQA models. We identify and address several reliability challenges in existing QG/A work: (a) QG questions should respect the prompt (avoiding hallucinations, duplications, and omissions) and (b) VQA answers should be consistent (not asserting that there is no motorcycle in an image while also claiming the motorcycle is blue). We address these issues with Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG), an empirically grounded evaluation framework inspired by formal semantics, which is adaptable to any QG/A frameworks. DSG produces atomic and unique questions organized in dependency graphs, which (i) ensure appropriate semantic coverage and (ii) sidestep inconsistent answers. With extensive experimentation and human evaluation on a range of model configurations (LLM, VQA, and T2I), we empirically demonstrate that DSG addresses the challenges noted above. Finally, we present DSG-1k, an open-sourced evaluation benchmark that includes 1,060 prompts, covering a wide range of fine-grained semantic categories with a balanced distribution. We release the DSG-1k prompts and the corresponding DSG questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingzhe He, Zhiwen Cao, Nicholas Kolkin, Lantao Yu, Kun Wan, Helge Rhodin, Ratheesh Kalarot</p>
<p>Abstract: Large text-to-image models have revolutionized the ability to generate imagery using natural language. However, particularly unique or personal visual concepts, such as pets and furniture, will not be captured by the original model. This has led to interest in how to personalize a text-to-image model. Despite significant progress, this task remains a formidable challenge, particularly in preserving the subject's identity. Most researchers attempt to address this issue by modifying model architectures. These methods are capable of keeping the subject structure and color but fail to preserve identity details. Towards this issue, our approach takes a data-centric perspective. We introduce a novel regularization dataset generation strategy on both the text and image level. This strategy enables the model to preserve fine details of the desired subjects, such as text and logos. Our method is architecture-agnostic and can be flexibly applied on various text-to-image models. We show on established benchmarks that our data-centric approach forms the new state of the art in terms of identity preservation and text alignment.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11317">Discrete approximations of Gaussian smoothing and Gaussian derivatives</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tony Lindeberg</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper develops an in-depth treatment concerning the problem of approximating the Gaussian smoothing and Gaussian derivative computations in scale-space theory for application on discrete data. With close connections to previous axiomatic treatments of continuous and discrete scale-space theory, we consider three main ways discretizing these scale-space operations in terms of explicit discrete convolutions, based on either (i) sampling the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels, (ii) locally integrating the Gaussian kernels and the Gaussian derivative kernels over each pixel support region and (iii) basing the scale-space analysis on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and then computing derivative approximations by applying small-support central difference operators to the spatially smoothed image data.
  We study the properties of these three main discretization methods both theoretically and experimentally, and characterize their performance by quantitative measures, including the results they give rise to with respect to the task of scale selection, investigated for four different use cases, and with emphasis on the behaviour at fine scales. The results show that the sampled Gaussian kernels and derivatives as well as the integrated Gaussian kernels and derivatives perform very poorly at very fine scales. At very fine scales, the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel with its corresponding discrete derivative approximations performs substantially better. The sampled Gaussian kernel and the sampled Gaussian derivatives do, on the other hand, lead to numerically very good approximations of the corresponding continuous results, when the scale parameter is sufficiently large, in the experiments presented in the paper, when the scale parameter is greater than a value of about 1, in units of the grid spacing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdul Muqeet, Kyuchul Lee, Bumsoo Kim, Yohan Hong, Hyungrae Lee, Woonggon Kim, KwangHee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Video face re-aging deals with altering the apparent age of a person to the target age in videos. This problem is challenging due to the lack of paired video datasets maintaining temporal consistency in identity and age. Most re-aging methods process each image individually without considering the temporal consistency of videos. While some existing works address the issue of temporal coherence through video facial attribute manipulation in latent space, they often fail to deliver satisfactory performance in age transformation. To tackle the issues, we propose (1) a novel synthetic video dataset that features subjects across a diverse range of age groups; (2) a baseline architecture designed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed dataset, and (3) the development of novel metrics tailored explicitly for evaluating the temporal consistency of video re-aging techniques. Our comprehensive experiments on public datasets, including VFHQ and CelebA-HQ, show that our method outperforms existing approaches in age transformation accuracy and temporal consistency. Notably, in user studies, our method was preferred for temporal consistency by 48.1\% of participants for the older direction and by 39.3\% for the younger direction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Chu, Zhedong Zheng, Wei Ji, Tingyu Wang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating drones through natural language commands remains challenging due to the dearth of accessible multi-modal datasets and the stringent precision requirements for aligning visual and textual data. To address this pressing need, we introduce GeoText-1652, a new natural language-guided geo-localization benchmark. This dataset is systematically constructed through an interactive human-computer process leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) driven annotation techniques in conjunction with pre-trained vision models. GeoText-1652 extends the established University-1652 image dataset with spatial-aware text annotations, thereby establishing one-to-one correspondences between image, text, and bounding box elements. We further introduce a new optimization objective to leverage fine-grained spatial associations, called blending spatial matching, for region-level spatial relation matching. Extensive experiments reveal that our approach maintains a competitive recall rate comparing other prevailing cross-modality methods. This underscores the promising potential of our approach in elevating drone control and navigation through the seamless integration of natural language commands in real-world scenarios.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14064">HGCLIP: Exploring Vision-Language Models with Graph Representations for Hierarchical Understanding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Xia, Xingtong Yu, Ming Hu, Lie Ju, Zhiyong Wang, Peibo Duan, Zongyuan Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: Object categories are typically organized into a multi-granularity taxonomic hierarchy. When classifying categories at different hierarchy levels, traditional uni-modal approaches focus primarily on image features, revealing limitations in complex scenarios. Recent studies integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with class hierarchies have shown promise, yet they fall short of fully exploiting the hierarchical relationships. These efforts are constrained by their inability to perform effectively across varied granularity of categories. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework (HGCLIP) that effectively combines CLIP with a deeper exploitation of the Hierarchical class structure via Graph representation learning. We explore constructing the class hierarchy into a graph, with its nodes representing the textual or image features of each category. After passing through a graph encoder, the textual features incorporate hierarchical structure information, while the image features emphasize class-aware features derived from prototypes through the attention mechanism. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements on 11 diverse visual recognition benchmarks. Our codes are fully available at https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/HGCLIP.</p>

<p>Abstract: Zero-shot talking avatar generation aims at synthesizing natural talking videos from speech and a single portrait image. Previous methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based motion representation and 3D Morphable Models, which limit the naturalness and diversity of the generated avatars. In this work, we introduce GAIA (Generative AI for Avatar), which eliminates the domain priors in talking avatar generation. In light of the observation that the speech only drives the motion of the avatar while the appearance of the avatar and the background typically remain the same throughout the entire video, we divide our approach into two stages: 1) disentangling each frame into motion and appearance representations; 2) generating motion sequences conditioned on the speech and reference portrait image. We collect a large-scale high-quality talking avatar dataset and train the model on it with different scales (up to 2B parameters). Experimental results verify the superiority, scalability, and flexibility of GAIA as 1) the resulting model beats previous baseline models in terms of naturalness, diversity, lip-sync quality, and visual quality; 2) the framework is scalable since larger models yield better results; 3) it is general and enables different applications like controllable talking avatar generation and text-instructed avatar generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Kothandaraman, Tianyi Zhou, Ming Lin, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: We present HawkI, for synthesizing aerial-view images from text and an exemplar image, without any additional multi-view or 3D information for finetuning or at inference. HawkI uses techniques from classical computer vision and information theory. It seamlessly blends the visual features from the input image within a pretrained text-to-2Dimage stable diffusion model with a test-time optimization process for a careful bias-variance trade-off, which uses an Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) homography transformation to provide subtle cues for aerialview synthesis. At inference, HawkI employs a unique mutual information guidance formulation to steer the generated image towards faithfully replicating the semantic details of the input-image, while maintaining a realistic aerial perspective. Mutual information guidance maximizes the semantic consistency between the generated image and the input image, without enforcing pixel-level correspondence between vastly different viewpoints. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons against text + exemplar-image based methods and 3D/ multi-view based novel-view synthesis methods on proposed synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves a significantly better bias-variance trade-off towards generating high fidelity aerial-view images.Code and data is available at https://github.com/divyakraman/HawkI2024.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cindy Le, Congrui Hetang, Chendi Lin, Ang Cao, Yihui He</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to generate textures for 3D models given text prompts and 3D meshes. Additional depth information is taken into account to perform the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) process with depth conditional Stable Diffusion. We ran our model over the open-source dataset Objaverse and conducted a user study to compare the results with those of various 3D texturing methods. We have shown that our model can generate more satisfactory results and produce various art styles for the same object. In addition, we achieved faster time when generating textures of comparable quality. We also conduct thorough ablation studies of how different factors may affect generation quality, including sampling steps, guidance scale, negative prompts, data augmentation, elevation range, and alternatives to SDS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Guo, Anshul Shah, Jiang Liu, Ayush Gupta, Rama Chellappa, Cheng Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Gait recognition holds the promise to robustly identify subjects based on walking patterns instead of appearance information. In recent years, this field has been dominated by learning methods based on two principal input representations: dense silhouette masks or sparse pose keypoints. In this work, we propose a novel, point-based Contour-Pose representation, which compactly expresses both body shape and body parts information. We further propose a local-to-global architecture, called GaitContour, to leverage this novel representation and efficiently compute subject embedding in two stages. The first stage consists of a local transformer that extracts features from five different body regions. The second stage then aggregates the regional features to estimate a global human gait representation. Such a design significantly reduces the complexity of the attention operation and improves efficiency and performance simultaneously. Through large scale experiments, GaitContour is shown to perform significantly better than previous point-based methods, while also being significantly more efficient than silhouette-based methods. On challenging datasets with significant distractors, GaitContour can even outperform silhouette-based methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17061">HumanGaussian: Text-Driven 3D Human Generation with Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian Liu, Xiaohang Zhan, Jiaxiang Tang, Ying Shan, Gang Zeng, Dahua Lin, Xihui Liu, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Realistic 3D human generation from text prompts is a desirable yet challenging task. Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or neural fields via score distillation sampling (SDS), which suffers from inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically, 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover, we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score, which well addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive quality of our framework, rendering vivid 3D humans under diverse scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Huang, Yifan Zhou, Ram Prabhakar, Xijun Liu, Yuxiang Guo, Hongrui Yi, Cheng Peng, Rama Chellappa, Chun Pong Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) is a challenging problem, focusing on identifying individuals across diverse settings. However, previous ReID methods primarily concentrated on a single domain or modality, such as Clothes-Changing ReID (CC-ReID) and video ReID. Real-world ReID is not constrained by factors like clothes or input types. Recent approaches emphasize on learning semantics through pre-training to enhance ReID performance but are hindered by coarse granularity, on-clothes focus and pre-defined areas. To address these limitations, we propose a Local Semantic Extraction (LSE) module inspired by Interactive Segmentation Models. The LSE module captures fine-grained, biometric, and flexible local semantics, enhancing ReID accuracy. Additionally, we introduce Semantic ReID (SemReID), a pre-training method that leverages LSE to learn effective semantics for seamless transfer across various ReID domains and modalities. Extensive evaluations across nine ReID datasets demonstrates SemReID's robust performance across multiple domains, including clothes-changing ReID, video ReID, unconstrained ReID, and short-term ReID. Our findings highlight the importance of effective semantics in ReID, as SemReID can achieve great performances without domain-specific designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daeun Seo, Hoeseok Yang, Hyungshin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving constant accuracy in object detection is challenging due to the inherent variability of object sizes. One effective approach to this problem involves optimizing input resolution, referred to as a multi-resolution strategy. Previous approaches to resolution optimization have often been based on pre-defined resolutions with manual selection. However, there is a lack of study on run-time resolution optimization for existing architectures. This paper introduces DyRA, a dynamic resolution adjustment network providing an image-specific scale factor for existing detectors. This network is co-trained with detectors utilizing specially designed loss functions, namely ParetoScaleLoss and BalanceLoss. ParetoScaleLoss determines an adaptive scale factor for robustness, while BalanceLoss optimizes overall scale factors according to the localization performance of the detector. The loss function is devised to minimize the accuracy drop across contrasting objectives of different-sized objects for scaling. Our proposed network can improve accuracy across various models, including RetinaNet, Faster-RCNN, FCOS, DINO, and H-Deformable-DETR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Pin Huang, Kai-Po Chang, Chung-Ting Tsai, Yung-Hsuan Lai, Fu-En Yang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models aims to disable pre-trained diffusion models from generating images related to a target concept. To perform reliable concept erasure, the properties of robustness and locality are desirable. The former refrains the model from producing images associated with the target concept for any paraphrased or learned prompts, while the latter preserves its ability in generating images with non-target concepts. In this paper, we propose Reliable Concept Erasing via Lightweight Erasers (Receler). It learns a lightweight Eraser to perform concept erasing while satisfying the above desirable properties by proposed concept-localized regularization and adversarial prompt learning schemes. Comprehensive experiments with various concepts verify the superiority of Receler over previous methods. Our code will be available upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangxin Shang, Jie Fu, Yehui Yang, Haifeng Huang, Junwei Liu, Lei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale public datasets with high-quality annotations are rarely available for intelligent medical imaging research, due to data privacy concerns and the cost of annotations. In this paper, we release SynFundus-1M, a high-quality synthetic dataset containing over one million fundus images in terms of \textbf{eleven disease types}. Furthermore, we deliberately assign four readability labels to the key regions of the fundus images. To the best of our knowledge, SynFundus-1M is currently the largest fundus dataset with the most sophisticated annotations. Leveraging over 1.3 million private authentic fundus images from various scenarios, we trained a powerful Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, named SynFundus-Generator. The released SynFundus-1M are generated by SynFundus-Generator under predefined conditions. To demonstrate the value of SynFundus-1M, extensive experiments are designed in terms of the following aspect: 1) Authenticity of the images: we randomly blend the synthetic images with authentic fundus images, and find that experienced annotators can hardly distinguish the synthetic images from authentic ones. Moreover, we show that the disease-related vision features (e.g. lesions) are well simulated in the synthetic images. 2) Effectiveness for down-stream fine-tuning and pretraining: we demonstrate that retinal disease diagnosis models of either convolutional neural networks (CNN) or Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures can benefit from SynFundus-1M, and compared to the datasets commonly used for pretraining, models trained on SynFundus-1M not only achieve superior performance but also demonstrate faster convergence on various downstream tasks. SynFundus-1M is already public available for the open-source community.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02638">Synchronization is All You Need: Exocentric-to-Egocentric Transfer for Temporal Action Segmentation with Unlabeled Synchronized Video Pairs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Camillo Quattrocchi, Antonino Furnari, Daniele Di Mauro, Mario Valerio Giuffrida, Giovanni Maria Farinella</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of transferring a temporal action segmentation system initially designed for exocentric (fixed) cameras to an egocentric scenario, where wearable cameras capture video data. The conventional supervised approach requires the collection and labeling of a new set of egocentric videos to adapt the model, which is costly and time-consuming. Instead, we propose a novel methodology which performs the adaptation leveraging existing labeled exocentric videos and a new set of unlabeled, synchronized exocentric-egocentric video pairs, for which temporal action segmentation annotations do not need to be collected. We implement the proposed methodology with an approach based on knowledge distillation, which we investigate both at the feature and Temporal Action Segmentation model level. Experiments on Assembly101 and EgoExo4D demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against classic unsupervised domain adaptation and temporal alignment approaches. Without bells and whistles, our best model performs on par with supervised approaches trained on labeled egocentric data, without ever seeing a single egocentric label, achieving a +15.99 improvement in the edit score (28.59 vs 12.60) on the Assembly101 dataset compared to a baseline model trained solely on exocentric data. In similar settings, our method also improves edit score by +3.32 on the challenging EgoExo4D benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing egocentric hand-object interaction detection. Via extensive experiments and comparative analyses on three egocentric datasets, VISOR, EgoHOS, and ENIGMA-51, our findings reveal how to exploit synthetic data for the HOI detection task when real labeled data are scarce or unavailable. Specifically, by leveraging only 10% of real labeled data, we achieve improvements in Overall AP compared to baselines trained exclusively on real data of: +5.67% on EPIC-KITCHENS VISOR, +8.24% on EgoHOS, and +11.69% on ENIGMA-51. Our analysis is supported by a novel data generation pipeline and the newly introduced HOI-Synth benchmark which augments existing datasets with synthetic images of hand-object interactions automatically labeled with hand-object contact states, bounding boxes, and pixel-wise segmentation masks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Doriand Petit, Steve Bourgeois, Dumitru Pavel, Vincent Gay-Bellile, Florian Chabot, Loic Barthe</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Fields mostly rely on developing task-specific supervision which often complicates the models. Rather than developing hard-to-combine and specific modules, another approach generally overlooked is to directly inject generic priors on the scene representation (also called inductive biases) into the NeRF architecture. Based on this idea, we propose the RING-NeRF architecture which includes two inductive biases : a continuous multi-scale representation of the scene and an invariance of the decoder's latent space over spatial and scale domains. We also design a single reconstruction process that takes advantage of those inductive biases and experimentally demonstrates on-par performances in terms of quality with dedicated architecture on multiple tasks (anti-aliasing, few view reconstruction, SDF reconstruction without scene-specific initialization) while being more efficient. Moreover, RING-NeRF has the distinctive ability to dynamically increase the resolution of the model, opening the way to adaptive reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng Jin, Shuhuai Li, Tong Li, Wentao Liu, Chen Qian, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-centric perception (e.g. pedetrian detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and attribute analysis) is a long-standing problem for computer vision. This paper introduces a unified and versatile framework (HQNet) for single-stage multi-person multi-task human-centric perception (HCP). Our approach centers on learning a unified human query representation, denoted as Human Query, which captures intricate instance-level features for individual persons and disentangles complex multi-person scenarios. Although different HCP tasks have been well-studied individually, single-stage multi-task learning of HCP tasks has not been fully exploited in the literature due to the absence of a comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address this gap, we propose COCO-UniHuman benchmark dataset to enable model development and comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's state-of-the-art performance among multi-task HCP models and its competitive performance compared to task-specific HCP models. Moreover, our experiments underscore Human Query's adaptability to new HCP tasks, thus demonstrating its robust generalization capability. Codes and data will be publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuda Zou, Xin Xiao, Peilin Zhou, Zhichao Sun, Bo Du, Yongchao Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Object counting typically uses 2D point annotations. The complexity of object shapes and the subjectivity of annotators may lead to annotation inconsistency, potentially confusing counting model training. Some sophisticated noise-resistance counting methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue. Differently, we aim to directly refine the initial point annotations before training counting models. For that, we propose the Shifted Autoencoders (SAE), which enhances annotation consistency. Specifically, SAE applies random shifts to initial point annotations and employs a UNet to restore them to their original positions. Similar to MAE reconstruction, the trained SAE captures general position knowledge and ignores specific manual offset noise. This allows to restore the initial point annotations to more general and thus consistent positions. Extensive experiments show that using such refined consistent annotations to train some advanced (including noise-resistance) object counting models steadily/significantly boosts their performances. Remarkably, the proposed SAE helps to set new records on nine datasets. We will make codes and refined point annotations available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqian Yuan, Wentong Li, Jian Liu, Dongqi Tang, Xinjie Luo, Chi Qin, Lei Zhang, Jianke Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved impressive general-purpose vision-language capabilities through visual instruction tuning. However, current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level or box-level understanding, falling short in achieving fine-grained vision-language alignment at pixel level. Besides, the lack of mask-based instruction data limits their advancements. In this paper, we propose Osprey, a mask-text instruction tuning approach, to extend MLLMs by incorporating fine-grained mask regions into language instruction, aiming at achieving pixel-wise visual understanding. To achieve this goal, we first meticulously curate a mask-based region-text dataset with 724K samples, and then design a vision-language model by injecting pixel-level representation into LLM. Specifically, Osprey adopts a convolutional CLIP backbone as the vision encoder and employs a mask-aware visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high resolution input. Experimental results demonstrate Osprey's superiority in various region understanding tasks, showcasing its new capability for pixel-level instruction tuning. In particular, Osprey can be integrated with Segment Anything Model (SAM) seamlessly to obtain multi-granularity semantics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young Joo Han, Ha-Jin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing real sRGB noise is crucial for various low-level vision tasks, such as building datasets for training image denoising systems. The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We simultaneously employ a pixel-wise noise modeling network based on Normalizing Flows, and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines on the sRGB noise synthesis task. Moreover, the denoising neural network, trained with synthesized image pairs from our model, also shows superior performance compared to other baselines.

<p>Abstract: The capability to accurately estimate 3D human poses is crucial for diverse fields such as action recognition, gait recognition, and virtual/augmented reality. However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field is the accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion. Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lack of temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-based models benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations when faced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. This challenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond their training datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in the training data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-video based TempoRally contInuous occlusion Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novel Test-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video. This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered during the model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisy initial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during test time, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our framework demonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use any off-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporal consistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where it not only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimation models but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions, achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in subject-driven image generation have led to zero-shot generation, yet precise selection and focus on crucial subject representations remain challenging. Addressing this, we introduce the SSR-Encoder, a novel architecture designed for selectively capturing any subject from single or multiple reference images. It responds to various query modalities including text and masks, without necessitating test-time fine-tuning. The SSR-Encoder combines a Token-to-Patch Aligner that aligns query inputs with image patches and a Detail-Preserving Subject Encoder for extracting and preserving fine features of the subjects, thereby generating subject embeddings. These embeddings, used in conjunction with original text embeddings, condition the generation process. Characterized by its model generalizability and efficiency, the SSR-Encoder adapts to a range of custom models and control modules. Enhanced by the Embedding Consistency Regularization Loss for improved training, our extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in versatile and high-quality image generation, indicating its broad applicability.

<p>Abstract: Terrain surface roughness, often described abstractly, poses challenges in quantitative characterisation with various descriptors found in the literature. This study compares five commonly used roughness descriptors, exploring correlations among their quantified terrain surface roughness maps across three terrains with distinct spatial variations. Additionally, the study investigates the impacts of spatial scales and interpolation methods on these correlations. Dense point cloud data obtained through Light Detection and Ranging technique are used in this study. The findings highlight both global pattern similarities and local pattern distinctions in the derived roughness maps, emphasizing the significance of incorporating multiple descriptors in studies where local roughness values play a crucial role in subsequent analyses. The spatial scales were found to have a smaller impact on rougher terrain, while interpolation methods had minimal influence on roughness maps derived from different descriptors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Gao, Tianheng Qiu, Xinyu Zhang, Hanlin Bai, Kang Liu, Xuan Huang, Hu Wei, Guoying Zhang, Huaping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Coarse-to-fine schemes are widely used in traditional single-image motion deblur; however, in the context of deep learning, existing multi-scale algorithms not only require the use of complex modules for feature fusion of low-scale RGB images and deep semantics, but also manually generate low-resolution pairs of images that do not have sufficient confidence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale network based on single-input and multiple-outputs(SIMO) for motion deblurring. This simplifies the complexity of algorithms based on a coarse-to-fine scheme. To alleviate restoration defects impacting detail information brought about by using a multi-scale architecture, we combine the characteristics of real-world blurring trajectories with a learnable wavelet transform module to focus on the directional continuity and frequency features of the step-by-step transitions between blurred images to sharp images. In conclusion, we propose a multi-scale network with a learnable discrete wavelet transform (MLWNet), which exhibits state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world deblurred datasets, in terms of both subjective and objective quality as well as computational efficiency.</p>

This oversight leads to skewed BN statistics and undermines the reliability of the model under non-i.i.d. scenarios. To tackle this challenge, this paper presents a novel method termed 'Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics' (UnMix-TNS). Our method re-calibrates the statistics for each instance within a test batch by mixing it with multiple distinct statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. scenario. The core of this method hinges on a distinctive online unmixing procedure that continuously updates these statistics components by incorporating the most similar instances from new test batches. Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with a wide range of leading test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers. Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios-ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts, particularly excelling with temporally correlated test data and corrupted non-i.i.d. real-world streams. This adaptability is maintained even with very small batch sizes or single instances. Our results highlight UnMix-TNS's capacity to markedly enhance stability and performance across various benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/devavratTomar/unmixtns.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12175">Template-Free Single-View 3D Human Digitalization with Diffusion-Guided LRM</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenzhen Weng, Jingyuan Liu, Hao Tan, Zhan Xu, Yang Zhou, Serena Yeung-Levy, Jimei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing 3D humans from a single image has been extensively investigated. However, existing approaches often fall short on capturing fine geometry and appearance details, hallucinating occluded parts with plausible details, and achieving generalization across unseen and in-the-wild datasets. We present Human-LRM, a diffusion-guided feed-forward model that predicts the implicit field of a human from a single image. Leveraging the power of the state-of-the-art reconstruction model (i.e., LRM) and generative model (i.e Stable Diffusion), our method is able to capture human without any template prior, e.g., SMPL, and effectively enhance occluded parts with rich and realistic details. Our approach first uses a single-view LRM model with an enhanced geometry decoder to get the triplane NeRF representation. The novel view renderings from the triplane NeRF provide strong geometry and color prior, from which we generate photo-realistic details for the occluded parts using a diffusion model. The generated multiple views then enable reconstruction with high-quality geometry and appearance, leading to superior overall performance comparing to all existing human reconstruction methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pinxin Liu, Luchuan Song, Daoan Zhang, Hang Hua, Yunlong Tang, Huaijin Tu, Jiebo Luo, Chenliang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Artistic video portrait generation is a significant and sought-after task in the fields of computer graphics and vision. While various methods have been developed that integrate NeRFs or StyleGANs with instructional editing models for creating and editing drivable portraits, these approaches face several challenges. They often rely heavily on large datasets, require extensive customization processes, and frequently result in reduced image quality. To address the above problems, we propose the Efficient Monotonic Video Style Avatar (Emo-Avatar) through deferred neural rendering that enhances StyleGAN's capacity for producing dynamic, drivable portrait videos. We proposed a two-stage deferred neural rendering pipeline. In the first stage, we utilize few-shot PTI initialization to initialize the StyleGAN generator through several extreme poses sampled from the video to capture the consistent representation of aligned faces from the target portrait. In the second stage, we propose a Laplacian pyramid for high-frequency texture sampling from UV maps deformed by dynamic flow of expression for motion-aware texture prior integration to provide torso features to enhance StyleGAN's ability to generate complete and upper body for portrait video rendering. Emo-Avatar reduces style customization time from hours to merely 5 minutes compared with existing methods. In addition, Emo-Avatar requires only a single reference image for editing and employs region-aware contrastive learning with semantic invariant CLIP guidance, ensuring consistent high-resolution output and identity preservation. Through both quantitative and qualitative assessments, Emo-Avatar demonstrates superior performance over existing methods in terms of training efficiency, rendering quality and editability in self- and cross-reenactment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shufan Li, Harkanwar Singh, Aditya Grover</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Transformers have become the de-facto architecture for sequence modeling on text and a variety of multi-dimensional data, such as images and video. However, the use of self-attention layers in a Transformer incurs prohibitive compute and memory complexity that scales quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length. A recent architecture, Mamba, based on state space models has been shown to achieve comparable performance for modeling text sequences, while scaling linearly with the sequence length. In this work, we present Mamba-ND, a generalized design extending the Mamba architecture to arbitrary multi-dimensional data. Our design alternatively unravels the input data across different dimensions following row-major orderings. We provide a systematic comparison of Mamba-ND with several other alternatives, based on prior multi-dimensional extensions such as Bi-directional LSTMs and S4ND. Empirically, we show that Mamba-ND demonstrates performance competitive with the state-of-the-art on a variety of multi-dimensional benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K classification, HMDB-51 action recognition, and ERA5 weather forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsung Jeon, Hyundong Jin, Jonghyun Choi, Sanghyun Hong, Dongeun Lee, Kookjin Lee, Noseong Park</p>
<p>Abstract: A standard practice in developing image recognition models is to train a model on a specific image resolution and then deploy it. However, in real-world inference, models often encounter images different from the training sets in resolution and/or subject to natural variations such as weather changes, noise types and compression artifacts. While traditional solutions involve training multiple models for different resolutions or input variations, these methods are computationally expensive and thus do not scale in practice. To this end, we propose a novel neural network model, parallel-structured and all-component Fourier neural operator (PAC-FNO), that addresses the problem. Unlike conventional feed-forward neural networks, PAC-FNO operates in the frequency domain, allowing it to handle images of varying resolutions within a single model. We also propose a two-stage algorithm for training PAC-FNO with a minimal modification to the original, downstream model. Moreover, the proposed PAC-FNO is ready to work with existing image recognition models. Extensively evaluating methods with seven image recognition benchmarks, we show that the proposed PAC-FNO improves the performance of existing baseline models on images with various resolutions by up to 77.1% and various types of natural variations in the images at inference.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16594">CURSOR: Scalable Mixed-Order Hypergraph Matching with CUR Decomposition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixuan Zheng, Ming Zhang, Hong Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: To achieve greater accuracy, hypergraph matching algorithms require exponential increases in computational resources. Recent kd-tree-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) methods, despite the sparsity of their compatibility tensor, still require exhaustive calculations for large-scale graph matching. This work utilizes CUR tensor decomposition and introduces a novel cascaded second and third-order hypergraph matching framework (CURSOR) for efficient hypergraph matching. A CUR-based second-order graph matching algorithm is used to provide a rough match, and then the core of CURSOR, a fiber-CUR-based tensor generation method, directly calculates entries of the compatibility tensor by leveraging the initial second-order match result. This significantly decreases the time complexity and tensor density. A probability relaxation labeling (PRL)-based matching algorithm, specifically suitable for sparse tensors, is developed. Experiment results on large-scale synthetic datasets and widely-adopted benchmark sets demonstrate the superiority of CURSOR over existing methods. The tensor generation method in CURSOR can be integrated seamlessly into existing hypergraph matching methods to improve their performance and lower their computational costs.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01818">AllSpark: Reborn Labeled Features from Unlabeled in Transformer for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haonan Wang, Qixiang Zhang, Yi Li, Xiaomeng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has been proposed to alleviate the burden of time-consuming pixel-level manual labeling, which leverages limited labeled data along with larger amounts of unlabeled data. Current state-of-the-art methods train the labeled data with ground truths and unlabeled data with pseudo labels. However, the two training flows are separate, which allows labeled data to dominate the training process, resulting in low-quality pseudo labels and, consequently, sub-optimal results. To alleviate this issue, we present AllSpark, which reborns the labeled features from unlabeled ones with the channel-wise cross-attention mechanism. We further introduce a Semantic Memory along with a Channel Semantic Grouping strategy to ensure that unlabeled features adequately represent labeled features. The AllSpark shed new light on the architecture level designs of SSSS rather than framework level, which avoids increasingly complicated training pipeline designs. It can also be regarded as a flexible bottleneck module that can be seamlessly integrated into a general transformer-based segmentation model. The proposed AllSpark outperforms existing methods across all evaluation protocols on Pascal, Cityscapes and COCO benchmarks without bells-and-whistles.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizheng Gong, Siyue Yu, Xiaoyang Wang, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Most continual segmentation methods tackle the problem as a per-pixel classification task. However, such a paradigm is very challenging, and we find query-based segmenters with built-in objectness have inherent advantages compared with per-pixel ones, as objectness has strong transfer ability and forgetting resistance. Based on these findings, we propose CoMasTRe by disentangling continual segmentation into two stages: forgetting-resistant continual objectness learning and well-researched continual classification. CoMasTRe uses a two-stage segmenter learning class-agnostic mask proposals at the first stage and leaving recognition to the second stage. During continual learning, a simple but effective distillation is adopted to strengthen objectness. To further mitigate the forgetting of old classes, we design a multi-label class distillation strategy suited for segmentation. We assess the effectiveness of CoMasTRe on PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms per-pixel and query-based methods on both datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/jordangong/CoMasTRe.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04321">Discriminative Probing and Tuning for Text-to-Image Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leigang Qu, Wenjie Wang, Yongqi Li, Hanwang Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advancements in text-to-image generation (T2I), prior methods often face text-image misalignment problems such as relation confusion in generated images. Existing solutions involve cross-attention manipulation for better compositional understanding or integrating large language models for improved layout planning. However, the inherent alignment capabilities of T2I models are still inadequate. By reviewing the link between generative and discriminative modeling, we posit that T2I models' discriminative abilities may reflect their text-image alignment proficiency during generation. In this light, we advocate bolstering the discriminative abilities of T2I models to achieve more precise text-to-image alignment for generation. We present a discriminative adapter built on T2I models to probe their discriminative abilities on two representative tasks and leverage discriminative fine-tuning to improve their text-image alignment. As a bonus of the discriminative adapter, a self-correction mechanism can leverage discriminative gradients to better align generated images to text prompts during inference. Comprehensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrate our method's superior generation performance. Meanwhile, it achieves state-of-the-art discriminative performance on the two discriminative tasks compared to other generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yushan Zhang, Bastian Wandt, Maria Magnusson, Michael Felsberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene flow estimation is an essential ingredient for a variety of real-world applications, especially for autonomous agents, such as self-driving cars and robots. While recent scene flow estimation approaches achieve a reasonable accuracy, their applicability to real-world systems additionally benefits from a reliability measure. Aiming at improving accuracy while additionally providing an estimate for uncertainty, we propose DiffSF that combines transformer-based scene flow estimation with denoising diffusion models. In the diffusion process, the ground truth scene flow vector field is gradually perturbed by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse process, starting from randomly sampled Gaussian noise, the scene flow vector field prediction is recovered by conditioning on a source and a target point cloud. We show that the diffusion process greatly increases the robustness of predictions compared to prior approaches resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard scene flow estimation benchmarks. Moreover, by sampling multiple times with different initial states, the denoising process predicts multiple hypotheses, which enables measuring the output uncertainty, allowing our approach to detect a majority of the inaccurate predictions.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06462">Towards the Uncharted: Density-Descending Feature Perturbation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Wang, Huihui Bai, Limin Yu, Yao Zhao, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation allows model to mine effective supervision from unlabeled data to complement label-guided training. Recent research has primarily focused on consistency regularization techniques, exploring perturbation-invariant training at both the image and feature levels. In this work, we proposed a novel feature-level consistency learning framework named Density-Descending Feature Perturbation (DDFP). Inspired by the low-density separation assumption in semi-supervised learning, our key insight is that feature density can shed a light on the most promising direction for the segmentation classifier to explore, which is the regions with lower density. We propose to shift features with confident predictions towards lower-density regions by perturbation injection. The perturbed features are then supervised by the predictions on the original features, thereby compelling the classifier to explore less dense regions to effectively regularize the decision boundary. Central to our method is the estimation of feature density. To this end, we introduce a lightweight density estimator based on normalizing flow, allowing for efficient capture of the feature density distribution in an online manner. By extracting gradients from the density estimator, we can determine the direction towards less dense regions for each feature. The proposed DDFP outperforms other designs on feature-level perturbations and shows state of the art performances on both Pascal VOC and Cityscapes dataset under various partition protocols.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengyun Wang, Qianru Sun, Dong Zhang, Jinhui Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic scene completion (SSC) aims to predict complete 3D voxel occupancy and semantics from a single-view RGB-D image, and recent SSC methods commonly adopt multi-modal inputs. However, our investigation reveals two limitations: ineffective feature learning from single modalities and overfitting to limited datasets. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel SSC framework - Adversarial Modality Modulation Network (AMMNet) - with a fresh perspective of optimizing gradient updates. The proposed AMMNet introduces two core modules: a cross-modal modulation enabling the interdependence of gradient flows between modalities, and a customized adversarial training scheme leveraging dynamic gradient competition. Specifically, the cross-modal modulation adaptively re-calibrates the features to better excite representation potentials from each single modality. The adversarial training employs a minimax game of evolving gradients, with customized guidance to strengthen the generator's perception of visual fidelity from both geometric completeness and semantic correctness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AMMNet outperforms state-of-the-art SSC methods by a large margin, providing a promising direction for improving the effectiveness and generalization of SSC methods.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08568">Consistent Prompting for Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanxin Gao, Jun Cen, Xiaobin Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning empowers models to adapt autonomously to the ever-changing environment or data streams without forgetting old knowledge. Prompt-based approaches are built on frozen pre-trained models to learn the task-specific prompts and classifiers efficiently. Existing prompt-based methods are inconsistent between training and testing, limiting their effectiveness. Two types of inconsistency are revealed. Test predictions are made from all classifiers while training only focuses on the current task classifier without holistic alignment, leading to Classifier inconsistency. Prompt inconsistency indicates that the prompt selected during testing may not correspond to the one associated with this task during training. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt-based method, Consistent Prompting (CPrompt), for more aligned training and testing. Specifically, all existing classifiers are exposed to prompt training, resulting in classifier consistency learning. In addition, prompt consistency learning is proposed to enhance prediction robustness and boost prompt selection accuracy. Our Consistent Prompting surpasses its prompt-based counterparts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple continual learning benchmarks. Detailed analysis shows that improvements come from more consistent training and testing.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose GaussCtrl, a text-driven method to edit a 3D scene reconstructed by the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).
  Our method first renders a collection of images by using the 3DGS and edits them by using a pre-trained 2D diffusion model (ControlNet) based on the input prompt, which is then used to optimise the 3D model.
  Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the 3D model as in previous works.
  It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality.
  This is achieved by the two terms:
  (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps.
  (b) attention-based latent code alignment that unifies the appearance of edited images by conditioning their editing to several reference views through self and cross-view attention between images' latent representations.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster editing and better visual results than previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, causing a large proportion of skin cancer deaths. However, melanoma diagnoses by pathologists shows low interrater reliability. As melanoma is a cancer of the melanocyte, there is a clear need to develop a melanocytic cell segmentation tool that is agnostic to pathologist variability and automates pixel-level annotation. Gigapixel-level pathologist labeling, however, is impractical. Herein, we propose a means to train deep neural networks for melanocytic cell segmentation from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections and paired immunohistochemistry (IHC) of adjacent tissue sections, achieving a mean IOU of 0.64 despite imperfect ground-truth labels.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce EGIC, an enhanced generative image compression method that allows traversing the distortion-perception curve efficiently from a single model. EGIC is based on two novel building blocks: i) OASIS-C, a conditional pre-trained semantic segmentation-guided discriminator, which provides both spatially and semantically-aware gradient feedback to the generator, conditioned on the latent image distribution, and ii) Output Residual Prediction (ORP), a retrofit solution for multi-realism image compression that allows control over the synthesis process by adjusting the impact of the residual between an MSE-optimized and GAN-optimized decoder output on the GAN-based reconstruction. Together, EGIC forms a powerful codec, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion and GAN-based methods (e.g., HiFiC, MS-ILLM, and DIRAC-100), while performing almost on par with VTM-20.0 on the distortion end. EGIC is simple to implement, very lightweight, and provides excellent interpolation characteristics, which makes it a promising candidate for practical applications targeting the low bit range.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenming Xu, Meiqin Liu, Chao Yao, Weisi Lin, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned B-frame video compression aims to adopt bi-directional motion estimation and motion compensation (MEMC) coding for middle frame reconstruction. However, previous learned approaches often directly extend neural P-frame codecs to B-frame relying on bi-directional optical-flow estimation or video frame interpolation. They suffer from inaccurate quantized motions and inefficient motion compensation. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure called Interpolation-driven B-frame Video Compression (IBVC). Our approach only involves two major operations: video frame interpolation and artifact reduction compression. IBVC introduces a bit-rate free MEMC based on interpolation, which avoids optical-flow quantization and additional compression distortions. Later, to reduce duplicate bit-rate consumption and focus on unaligned artifacts, a residual guided masking encoder is deployed to adaptively select the meaningful contexts with interpolated multi-scale dependencies. In addition, a conditional spatio-temporal decoder is proposed to eliminate location errors and artifacts instead of using MEMC coding in other methods. The experimental results on B-frame coding demonstrate that IBVC has significant improvements compared to the relevant state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, our approach can save bit rates compared with the random access (RA) configuration of H.266 (VTM). The code will be available at https://github.com/ruhig6/IBVC.</p>

<p>Abstract: The intricate kinematics of the human hand enable simultaneous grasping and manipulation of multiple objects, essential for tasks such as object transfer and in-hand manipulation. Despite its significance, the domain of robotic multi-object grasping is relatively unexplored and presents notable challenges in kinematics, dynamics, and object configurations. This paper introduces MultiGrasp, a novel two-stage approach for multi-object grasping using a dexterous multi-fingered robotic hand on a tabletop. The process consists of (i) generating pre-grasp proposals and (ii) executing the grasp and lifting the objects. Our experimental focus is primarily on dual-object grasping, achieving a success rate of 44.13%, highlighting adaptability to new object configurations and tolerance for imprecise grasps. Additionally, the framework demonstrates the potential for grasping more than two objects at the cost of inference speed.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10517">Mind the map! Accounting for existing map information when estimating online HDMaps from sensor</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'emy Sun, Li Yang, Diane Lingrand, Fr\'ed\'eric Precioso</p>
<p>Abstract: While HDMaps are a crucial component of autonomous driving, they are expensive to acquire and maintain. Estimating these maps from sensors therefore promises to significantly lighten costs. These estimations however overlook existing HDMaps, with current methods at most geolocalizing low quality maps or considering a general database of known maps. In this paper, we propose to account for existing maps of the precise situation studied when estimating HDMaps. We identify 3 reasonable types of useful existing maps (minimalist, noisy, and outdated). We also introduce MapEX, a novel online HDMap estimation framework that accounts for existing maps. MapEX achieves this by encoding map elements into query tokens and by refining the matching algorithm used to train classic query based map estimation models. We demonstrate that MapEX brings significant improvements on the nuScenes dataset. For instance, MapEX - given noisy maps - improves by 38% over the MapTRv2 detector it is based on and by 8% over the current SOTA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linxi Zhao, Jiankai Tang, Dongyu Chen, Xiaohong Liu, Yong Zhou, Yuanchun Shi, Guangyu Wang, Yuntao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Nailfold capillaroscopy is widely used in assessing health conditions, highlighting the pressing need for an automated nailfold capillary analysis system. In this study, we present a pioneering effort in constructing a comprehensive nailfold capillary dataset-321 images, 219 videos from 68 subjects, with clinic reports and expert annotations-that serves as a crucial resource for training deep-learning models. Leveraging this dataset, we finetuned three deep learning models with expert annotations as supervised labels and integrated them into a novel end-to-end nailfold capillary analysis pipeline. This pipeline excels in automatically detecting and measuring a wide range of size factors, morphological features, and dynamic aspects of nailfold capillaries. We compared our outcomes with clinical reports. Experiment results showed that our automated pipeline achieves an average of sub-pixel level precision in measurements and 89.9% accuracy in identifying morphological abnormalities. These results underscore its potential for advancing quantitative medical research and enabling pervasive computing in healthcare.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03195">Efficient Bitrate Ladder Construction using Transfer Learning and Spatio-Temporal Features</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Falahati, Mohammad Karim Safavi, Ardavan Elahi, Farhad Pakdaman, Moncef Gabbouj</p>
<p>Abstract: Providing high-quality video with efficient bitrate is a main challenge in video industry. The traditional one-size-fits-all scheme for bitrate ladders is inefficient and reaching the best content-aware decision computationally impractical due to extensive encodings required. To mitigate this, we propose a bitrate and complexity efficient bitrate ladder prediction method using transfer learning and spatio-temporal features. We propose: (1) using feature maps from well-known pre-trained DNNs to predict rate-quality behavior with limited training data; and (2) improving highest quality rung efficiency by predicting minimum bitrate for top quality and using it for the top rung. The method tested on 102 video scenes demonstrates 94.1% reduction in complexity versus brute-force at 1.71% BD-Rate expense. Additionally, transfer learning was thoroughly studied through four networks and ablation studies.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10474">LDReg: Local Dimensionality Regularized Self-Supervised Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanxun Huang, Ricardo J. G. B. Campello, Sarah Monazam Erfani, Xingjun Ma, Michael E. Houle, James Bailey</p>
<p>Abstract: Representations learned via self-supervised learning (SSL) can be susceptible to dimensional collapse, where the learned representation subspace is of extremely low dimensionality and thus fails to represent the full data distribution and modalities. Dimensional collapse also known as the "underfilling" phenomenon is one of the major causes of degraded performance on downstream tasks. Previous work has investigated the dimensional collapse problem of SSL at a global level. In this paper, we demonstrate that representations can span over high dimensional space globally, but collapse locally. To address this, we propose a method called $\textit{local dimensionality regularization (LDReg)}$. Our formulation is based on the derivation of the Fisher-Rao metric to compare and optimize local distance distributions at an asymptotically small radius for each data point. By increasing the local intrinsic dimensionality, we demonstrate through a range of experiments that LDReg improves the representation quality of SSL. The results also show that LDReg can regularize dimensionality at both local and global levels.</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01977">TTA-Nav: Test-time Adaptive Reconstruction for Point-Goal Navigation under Visual Corruptions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maytus Piriyajitakonkij, Mingfei Sun, Mengmi Zhang, Wei Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot navigation under visual corruption presents a formidable challenge. To address this, we propose a Test-time Adaptation (TTA) method, named as TTA-Nav, for point-goal navigation under visual corruptions. Our "plug-and-play" method incorporates a top-down decoder to a pre-trained navigation model. Firstly, the pre-trained navigation model gets a corrupted image and extracts features. Secondly, the top-down decoder produces the reconstruction given the high-level features extracted by the pre-trained model. Then, it feeds the reconstruction of a corrupted image back to the pre-trained model. Finally, the pre-trained model does forward pass again to output action. Despite being trained solely on clean images, the top-down decoder can reconstruct cleaner images from corrupted ones without the need for gradient-based adaptation. The pre-trained navigation model with our top-down decoder significantly enhances navigation performance across almost all visual corruptions in our benchmarks. Our method improves the success rate of point-goal navigation from the state-of-the-art result of 46% to 94% on the most severe corruption. This suggests its potential for broader application in robotic visual navigation. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/tta-nav</p>

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06726">Probabilistic Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqun Du, Yulin Wang, Shiji Song, Gao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-tailed distributions frequently emerge in real-world data, where a large number of minority categories contain a limited number of samples. Such imbalance issue considerably impairs the performance of standard supervised learning algorithms, which are mainly designed for balanced training sets. Recent investigations have revealed that supervised contrastive learning exhibits promising potential in alleviating the data imbalance. However, the performance of supervised contrastive learning is plagued by an inherent challenge: it necessitates sufficiently large batches of training data to construct contrastive pairs that cover all categories, yet this requirement is difficult to meet in the context of class-imbalanced data. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a novel probabilistic contrastive (ProCo) learning algorithm that estimates the data distribution of the samples from each class in the feature space, and samples contrastive pairs accordingly. In fact, estimating the distributions of all classes using features in a small batch, particularly for imbalanced data, is not feasible. Our key idea is to introduce a reasonable and simple assumption that the normalized features in contrastive learning follow a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on unit space, which brings two-fold benefits. First, the distribution parameters can be estimated using only the first sample moment, which can be efficiently computed in an online manner across different batches. Second, based on the estimated distribution, the vMF distribution allows us to sample an infinite number of contrastive pairs and derive a closed form of the expected contrastive loss for efficient optimization.

<h1><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08551">GaussianImage: 1000 FPS Image Representation and Compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Zhang, Xingtong Ge, Tongda Xu, Dailan He, Yan Wang, Hongwei Qin, Guo Lu, Jing Geng, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 1000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.</p>
