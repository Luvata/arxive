<p><b>Authors:</b> Victoria Violet Hoyle</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the hypothesis that the OpenAI-o1 model--a transformer-based AI trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--displays characteristics of consciousness during its training and inference phases. Adopting functionalism, which argues that mental states are defined by their functional roles, we assess the possibility of AI consciousness. Drawing on theories from neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI research, we justify the use of functionalism and examine the model's architecture using frameworks like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and active inference. The paper also investigates how RLHF influences the model's internal reasoning processes, potentially giving rise to consciousness-like experiences. We compare AI and human consciousness, addressing counterarguments such as the absence of a biological basis and subjective qualia. Our findings suggest that the OpenAI-o1 model shows aspects of consciousness, while acknowledging the ongoing debates surrounding AI sentience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rithvik Prakki</p>
<p>Abstract: Active inference is a mathematical framework for understanding how agents (biological or artificial) interact with their environments, enabling continual adaptation and decision-making. It combines Bayesian inference and free energy minimization to model perception, action, and learning in uncertain and dynamic contexts. Unlike reinforcement learning, active inference integrates exploration and exploitation seamlessly by minimizing expected free energy. In this paper, we present a continual learning framework for agents operating in discrete time environments, using active inference as the foundation. We derive the mathematical formulations of variational and expected free energy and apply them to the design of a self-learning research agent. This agent updates its beliefs and adapts its actions based on new data without manual intervention. Through experiments in changing environments, we demonstrate the agent's ability to relearn and refine its models efficiently, making it suitable for complex domains like finance and healthcare. The paper concludes by discussing how the proposed framework generalizes to other systems, positioning active inference as a flexible approach for adaptive AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weitai Kang, Haifeng Huang, Yuzhang Shang, Mubarak Shah, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Large Language Models (3DLLMs) have highlighted their potential in building general-purpose agents in the 3D real world, yet challenges remain due to the lack of high-quality robust instruction-following data, leading to limited discriminative power and generalization of 3DLLMs. In this paper, we introduce Robin3D, a powerful 3DLLM trained on large-scale instruction-following data generated by our novel data engine, Robust Instruction Generation (RIG) engine. RIG generates two key instruction data: 1) the Adversarial Instruction-following data, which features mixed negative and positive samples to enhance the model's discriminative understanding. 2) the Diverse Instruction-following data, which contains various instruction styles to enhance model's generalization. As a result, we construct 1 million instruction-following data, consisting of 344K Adversarial samples, 508K Diverse samples, and 165K benchmark training set samples. To better handle these complex instructions, Robin3D first incorporates Relation-Augmented Projector to enhance spatial understanding, and then strengthens the object referring and grounding ability through ID-Feature Bonding. Robin3D consistently outperforms previous methods across five widely-used 3D multimodal learning benchmarks, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, we achieve a 7.8\% improvement in the grounding task (Multi3DRefer) and a 6.9\% improvement in the captioning task (Scan2Cap).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lancelot Da Costa, Tom\'a\v{s} Gaven\v{c}iak, David Hyland, Mandana Samiei, Cristian Dragos-Manta, Candice Pattisapu, Adeel Razi, Karl Friston</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper offers a roadmap for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mechanical reasoning is a fundamental ability that sets human intelligence apart from other animal intelligence. Mechanical reasoning allows us to design tools, build bridges and canals, and construct houses which set the foundation of human civilization. Embedding machines with such ability is an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Recently, Li et al. built CogDevelop2K, a data-intensive cognitive experiment benchmark for assaying the developmental trajectory of machine intelligence (Li et al., 2024). Here, to investigate mechanical reasoning in Vision Language Models, we leverage the MechBench of CogDevelop2K, which contains approximately 150 cognitive experiments, to test understanding of mechanical system stability, gears and pulley systems, seesaw-like systems and leverage principle, inertia and motion, and other fluid-related systems in Large Vision Language Models. We observe diverse yet consistent behaviors over these aspects in VLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowing others' intentions and taking others' perspectives are two core components of human intelligence that are typically considered to be instantiations of theory-of-mind. Infiltrating machines with these abilities is an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Recently, Li et al. built CogDevelop2K, a data-intensive cognitive experiment benchmark to assess the developmental trajectory of machine intelligence. Here, to investigate intentionality understanding and perspective-taking in Vision Language Models, we leverage the IntentBench and PerspectBench of CogDevelop2K, which contains over 300 cognitive experiments grounded in real-world scenarios and classic cognitive tasks, respectively. Surprisingly, we find VLMs achieving high performance on intentionality understanding but lower performance on perspective-taking. This challenges the common belief in cognitive science literature that perspective-taking at the corresponding modality is necessary for intentionality understanding.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00332">Vision Language Models Know Law of Conservation without Understanding More-or-Less</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dezhi Luo, Haiyun Lyu, Qingying Gao, Haoran Sun, Yijiang Li, Hokin Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Conservation is a critical milestone of cognitive development considered to be supported by both the understanding of quantitative concepts and the reversibility of mental operations. To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we leverage the ConserveBench from CogDevelop2K, a data-intensive cognitive experiment benchmark for assaying the developmental trajectory of machine intelligence. The battery includes over 350 questions across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve only transformational tasks, whereas the latter two also involve non-transformational tasks assessing the understanding of quantitative concepts alone. Surprisingly, we find that while VLMs are generally capable of conserving, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks which success is typically considered to be entailed by the ability to conserve. This implies that the law of conservation, at least in concrete domains, may exist without corresponding conceptual understanding of quantity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radiology reports often remain incomprehensible to patients, undermining patient-centered care. We present ReXplain (Radiology eXplanation), an innovative AI-driven system that generates patient-friendly video reports for radiology findings. ReXplain uniquely integrates a large language model for text simplification, an image segmentation model for anatomical region identification, and an avatar generation tool, producing comprehensive explanations with plain language, highlighted imagery, and 3D organ renderings. Our proof-of-concept study with five board-certified radiologists indicates that ReXplain could accurately deliver radiological information and effectively simulate one-on-one consultations. This work demonstrates a new paradigm in AI-assisted medical communication, potentially improving patient engagement and satisfaction in radiology care, and opens new avenues for research in multimodal medical communication.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00467">Dynamic Planning for LLM-based Graphical User Interface Automation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoqing Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Kehai Chen, Xinbe Ma, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has spurred considerable interest in advancing autonomous LLMs-based agents, particularly in intriguing applications within smartphone graphical user interfaces (GUIs). When presented with a task goal, these agents typically emulate human actions within a GUI environment until the task is completed. However, a key challenge lies in devising effective plans to guide action prediction in GUI tasks, though planning have been widely recognized as effective for decomposing complex tasks into a series of steps. Specifically, given the dynamic nature of environmental GUIs following action execution, it is crucial to dynamically adapt plans based on environmental feedback and action history.We show that the widely-used ReAct approach fails due to the excessively long historical dialogues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts (D-PoT) for LLM-based GUI agents.D-PoT involves the dynamic adjustment of planning based on the environmental feedback and execution history. Experimental results reveal that the proposed D-PoT significantly surpassed the strong GPT-4V baseline by +12.7% (34.66% $\rightarrow$ 47.36%) in accuracy. The analysis highlights the generality of dynamic planning in different backbone LLMs, as well as the benefits in mitigating hallucinations and adapting to unseen tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruhana Azam, Tamer Abuelsaad, Aditya Vempaty, Ashish Jagmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: As our world digitizes, web agents that can automate complex and monotonous tasks are becoming essential in streamlining workflows. This paper introduces an approach to improving web agent performance through multi-modal validation and self-refinement. We present a comprehensive study of different modalities (text, vision) and the effect of hierarchy for the automatic validation of web agents, building upon the state-of-the-art Agent-E web automation framework. We also introduce a self-refinement mechanism for web automation, using the developed auto-validator, that enables web agents to detect and self-correct workflow failures. Our results show significant gains on Agent-E's (a SOTA web agent) prior state-of-art performance, boosting task-completion rates from 76.2\% to 81.24\% on the subset of the WebVoyager benchmark. The approach presented in this paper paves the way for more reliable digital assistants in complex, real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Till Hofmann, Jens Cla{\ss}en</p>
<p>Abstract: Golog is an expressive high-level agent language that includes nondeterministic operators which allow to leave some of the decisions to be made only at execution time. This so-called program realization is typically implemented by means of search, or in an incremental online fashion. In this paper, we consider the more realistic case where parts of the non-determinism are under the control of the environment. Program realization then becomes a synthesis problem, where a successful realization executes the program and satisfies the temporal goal for all possible environment actions. We consider Golog programs in combination with an expressive class of first-order action theories that allow for an unbounded number of objects and non-local effects, together with a temporal goal specified in a first-order extension of LTLf. We solve the synthesis problem by constructing a game arena that captures all possible executions of the program while tracking the satisfaction of the temporal goal and then solving the resulting two-player game. We evaluate the approach in two domains, showing the general feasibility of the approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly pivotal across various domains, especially in handling complex data types. This includes structured data processing, as exemplified by ChartQA and ChatGPT-Ada, and multimodal unstructured data processing as seen in Visual Question Answering (VQA). These areas have attracted significant attention from both industry and academia. Despite this, there remains a lack of unified evaluation methodologies for these diverse data handling scenarios. In response, we introduce BabelBench, an innovative benchmark framework that evaluates the proficiency of LLMs in managing multimodal multistructured data with code execution. BabelBench incorporates a dataset comprising 247 meticulously curated problems that challenge the models with tasks in perception, commonsense reasoning, logical reasoning, and so on. Besides the basic capabilities of multimodal understanding, structured data processing as well as code generation, these tasks demand advanced capabilities in exploration, planning, reasoning and debugging. Our experimental findings on BabelBench indicate that even cutting-edge models like ChatGPT 4 exhibit substantial room for improvement. The insights derived from our comprehensive analysis offer valuable guidance for future research within the community. The benchmark data can be found at https://github.com/FFD8FFE/babelbench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Up-to-date and reliable Large Language Models (LLMs) are consistently sought after. Typically, LLMs are trained on a fixed dataset and then deployed. However, the training data continually becomes outdated. Enable automatic training of AI using web data involves significant concerns regarding data quality and safety due to bias, spam, and other unsafe or unwanted text. Pure data is essential for producing reliable models. Training a model on impure data may result in undesirable outcomes. This research proposes a system that collects web data and automatically filters out unwanted text with the assistance of existing trusted AI models. In the experiment, a small sample of web data was collected and filtered, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in purifying the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noel Loo, Fotis Iliopoulos, Wei Hu, Erik Vee</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising approach for transferring knowledge from a larger, more complex teacher model to a smaller student model. Traditionally, KD involves training the student to mimic the teacher's output probabilities, while more advanced techniques have explored guiding the student to adopt the teacher's internal representations. Despite its widespread success, the performance of KD in binary classification and few-class problems has been less satisfactory. This is because the information about the teacher model's generalization patterns scales directly with the number of classes. Moreover, several sophisticated distillation methods may not be universally applicable or effective for data types beyond Computer Vision. Consequently, effective distillation techniques remain elusive for a range of key real-world applications, such as sentiment analysis, search query understanding, and advertisement-query relevance assessment. Taking these observations into account, we introduce a novel method for distilling knowledge from the teacher's model representations, which we term Learning Embedding Linear Projections (LELP). Inspired by recent findings about the structure of final-layer representations, LELP works by identifying informative linear subspaces in the teacher's embedding space, and splitting them into pseudo-subclasses. The student model is then trained to replicate these pseudo-classes. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale NLP benchmarks like Amazon Reviews and Sentiment140 demonstrate the LELP is consistently competitive with, and typically superior to, existing state-of-the-art distillation algorithms for binary and few-class problems, where most KD methods suffer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gentiana Rashiti, Geethan Karunaratne, Mrinmaya Sachan, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: The retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system such as Retro has been shown to improve language modeling capabilities and reduce toxicity and hallucinations by retrieving from a database of non-parametric memory containing trillions of entries. We introduce Retro-li that shows retrieval can also help using a small-scale database, but it demands more accurate and better neighbors when searching in a smaller hence sparser non-parametric memory. This can be met by using a proper semantic similarity search. We further propose adding a regularization to the non-parametric memory for the first time: it significantly reduces perplexity when the neighbor search operations are noisy during inference, and it improves generalization when a domain shift occurs. We also show that Retro-li's non-parametric memory can potentially be implemented on analog in-memory computing hardware, exhibiting O(1) search time while causing noise in retrieving neighbors, with minimal (<1%) performance loss.

<p>Abstract: Machine-learning technologies are seeing increased deployment in real-world market scenarios. In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets. The study provides a foundation for further exploration into the ramifications of deferring high-stakes decisions to LLM-based agents.</p>

Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such as emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this ``Inner Monologue'' method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of technology, blockchain and artificial intelligence technology are playing a huge role in all walks of life. In the financial sector, blockchain solves many security problems in data storage and management in traditional systems with its advantages of decentralization and security. And artificial intelligence has huge advantages in financial forecasting and risk management through its powerful algorithmic modeling capabilities. In financial default prediction using blockchain and artificial intelligence technology is a very powerful application. Blockchain technology guarantees the credibility of data and consistency on all nodes, and machine learning builds a high-level default prediction model through detailed analysis of big data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guancheng Wan, Zewen Liu, Max S. Y. Lau, B. Aditya Prakash, Wei Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective epidemic forecasting is critical for public health strategies and efficient medical resource allocation, especially in the face of rapidly spreading infectious diseases. However, existing deep-learning methods often overlook the dynamic nature of epidemics and fail to account for the specific mechanisms of disease transmission. In response to these challenges, we introduce an innovative end-to-end framework called Epidemiology-Aware Neural ODE with Continuous Disease Transmission Graph (EARTH) in this paper. To learn continuous and regional disease transmission patterns, we first propose EANO, which seamlessly integrates the neural ODE approach with the epidemic mechanism, considering the complex spatial spread process during epidemic evolution. Additionally, we introduce GLTG to model global infection trends and leverage these signals to guide local transmission dynamically. To accommodate both the global coherence of epidemic trends and the local nuances of epidemic transmission patterns, we build a cross-attention approach to fuse the most meaningful information for forecasting. Through the smooth synergy of both components, EARTH offers a more robust and flexible approach to understanding and predicting the spread of infectious diseases. Extensive experiments show EARTH superior performance in forecasting real-world epidemics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Li, Zhennan Jiang, Yuhui Chen, Dongbin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: With high-dimensional state spaces, visual reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in exploitation and exploration, resulting in low sample efficiency and training stability. As a time-efficient diffusion model, although consistency models have been validated in online state-based RL, it is still an open question whether it can be extended to visual RL. In this paper, we investigate the impact of non-stationary distribution and the actor-critic framework on consistency policy in online RL, and find that consistency policy was unstable during the training, especially in visual RL with the high-dimensional state space. To this end, we suggest sample-based entropy regularization to stabilize the policy training, and propose a consistency policy with prioritized proximal experience regularization (CP3ER) to improve sample efficiency. CP3ER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 21 tasks across DeepMind control suite and Meta-world. To our knowledge, CP3ER is the first method to apply diffusion/consistency models to visual RL and demonstrates the potential of consistency models in visual RL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaohui Xu, Qi Cui, Jinxin Dong, Weiyang He, Chip-Hong Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Illegitimate reproduction, distribution and derivation of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models can inflict economic loss, reputation damage and even privacy infringement. Passive DNN intellectual property (IP) protection methods such as watermarking and fingerprinting attempt to prove the ownership upon IP violation, but they are often too late to stop catastrophic damage of IP abuse and too feeble against strong adversaries. In this paper, we propose IDEA, an Inverse Domain Expert Adaptation based proactive DNN IP protection method featuring active authorization and source traceability. IDEA generalizes active authorization as an inverse problem of domain adaptation. The multi-adaptive optimization is solved by a mixture-of-experts model with one real and two fake experts. The real expert re-optimizes the source model to correctly classify test images with a unique model user key steganographically embedded. The fake experts are trained to output random prediction on test images without or with incorrect user key embedded by minimizing their mutual information (MI) with the real expert. The MoE model is knowledge distilled into a unified protected model to avoid leaking the expert model features by maximizing their MI with additional multi-layer attention and contrastive representation loss optimization. IDEA not only prevents unauthorized users without the valid key to access the functional model, but also enable the model owner to validate the deployed model and trace the source of IP infringement. We extensively evaluate IDEA on five datasets and four DNN models to demonstrate its effectiveness in authorization control, culprit tracing success rate, and robustness against various attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannes Thurnherr, Kaspar Riesen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the transformer architecture has enabled substantial progress in many areas of pattern recognition and machine learning. However, as with other neural network models, there is currently no general method available to explain their inner workings. The present paper represents a first step towards this direction. We utilize \textit{Transformer Compiler for RASP} (Tracr) to generate a large dataset of pairs of transformer weights and corresponding RASP programs. Based on this dataset, we then build and train a model, with the aim of recovering the RASP code from the compiled model. We demonstrate that the simple form of Tracr compiled transformer weights is interpretable for such a decompiler model. In an empirical evaluation, our model achieves exact reproductions on more than 30\% of the test objects, while the remaining 70\% can generally be reproduced with only few errors. Additionally, more than 70\% of the programs, produced by our model, are functionally equivalent to the ground truth, and therefore a valid decompilation of the Tracr compiled transformer weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaushik Roy, Akila Dissanayake, Brendan Tidd, Peyman Moghadam</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong imitation learning for manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts that occur in incremental learning steps. Existing methods often focus on unsupervised skill discovery to construct an ever-growing skill library or distillation from multiple policies, which can lead to scalability issues as diverse manipulation tasks are continually introduced and may fail to ensure a consistent latent space throughout the learning process, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned skills. In this paper, we introduce M2Distill, a multi-modal distillation-based method for lifelong imitation learning focusing on preserving consistent latent space across vision, language, and action distributions throughout the learning process. By regulating the shifts in latent representations across different modalities from previous to current steps, and reducing discrepancies in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) policies between consecutive learning steps, we ensure that the learned policy retains its ability to perform previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new skills. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO lifelong imitation learning benchmark suites, including LIBERO-OBJECT, LIBERO-GOAL, and LIBERO-SPATIAL, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyue Hua, Mengting Wan, Shashank Vadrevu, Ryan Nadel, Yongfeng Zhang, Chi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents, as user-centric tools, are increasingly deployed for human task delegation, assisting with a broad spectrum of requests by generating thoughts, engaging with user proxies, and producing action plans. However, agents based on large language models (LLMs) often face substantial planning latency due to two primary factors: the efficiency limitations of the underlying LLMs due to their large size and high demand, and the structural complexity of the agents due to the extensive generation of intermediate thoughts to produce the final output. Given that inefficiency in service provision can undermine the value of automation for users, this paper presents a human-centered efficient agent planning method -- Interactive Speculative Planning -- aiming at enhancing the efficiency of agent planning through both system design and human-AI interaction. Our approach advocates for the co-design of the agent system and user interface, underscoring the importance of an agent system that can fluidly manage user interactions and interruptions. By integrating human interruptions as a fundamental component of the system, we not only make it more user-centric but also expedite the entire process by leveraging human-in-the-loop interactions to provide accurate intermediate steps. Code and data will be released.</p>

To contribute towards this topic, present work focuses on introducing biologically and economically motivated themes that have been neglected in the safety aspects of modern reinforcement learning literature, namely homeostasis, balancing multiple objectives, bounded objectives, diminishing returns, sustainability, and multi-agent resource sharing. We implemented eight main benchmark environments on the above themes, for illustrating the potential shortcomings of current mainstream discussions on AI safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oytun Demirbilek, Tingying Peng, Alaa Bessadok</p>
<p>Abstract: A morphological brain graph depicting a connectional fingerprint is of paramount importance for charting brain dysconnectivity patterns. Such data often has missing observations due to various reasons such as time-consuming and incomplete neuroimage processing pipelines. Thus, predicting a target brain graph from a source graph is crucial for better diagnosing neurological disorders with minimal data acquisition resources. Many brain graph generative models were proposed for promising results, yet they are mostly based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), which could suffer from mode collapse and require large training datasets. Recent developments in diffusion models address these problems by offering essential properties such as a stable training objective and easy scalability. However, applying a diffusion process to graph edges fails to maintain the topological symmetry of the brain connectivity matrices. To meet these challenges, we propose the Graph Residual Noise Learner Network (Grenol-Net), the first graph diffusion model for predicting a target graph from a source graph.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have become increasingly popular for generative modeling due to their ability to generate high-quality samples. This has unlocked exciting new possibilities for solving inverse problems, especially in image restoration and reconstruction, by treating diffusion models as unsupervised priors. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of methods that utilize pre-trained diffusion models to solve inverse problems without requiring further training. We introduce taxonomies to categorize these methods based on both the problems they address and the techniques they employ. We analyze the connections between different approaches, offering insights into their practical implementation and highlighting important considerations. We further discuss specific challenges and potential solutions associated with using latent diffusion models for inverse problems. This work aims to be a valuable resource for those interested in learning about the intersection of diffusion models and inverse problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Han, Zeyinzi Jiang, Yulin Pan, Jingfeng Zhang, Chaojie Mao, Chenwei Xie, Yu Liu, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative technology and have been found to be applicable in various scenarios. Most existing foundational diffusion models are primarily designed for text-guided visual generation and do not support multi-modal conditions, which are essential for many visual editing tasks. This limitation prevents these foundational diffusion models from serving as a unified model in the field of visual generation, like GPT-4 in the natural language processing field. In this work, we propose ACE, an All-round Creator and Editor, which achieves comparable performance compared to those expert models in a wide range of visual generation tasks. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a unified condition format termed Long-context Condition Unit (LCU), and propose a novel Transformer-based diffusion model that uses LCU as input, aiming for joint training across various generation and editing tasks. Furthermore, we propose an efficient data collection approach to address the issue of the absence of available training data. It involves acquiring pairwise images with synthesis-based or clustering-based pipelines and supplying these pairs with accurate textual instructions by leveraging a fine-tuned multi-modal large language model. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our model, we establish a benchmark of manually annotated pairs data across a variety of visual generation tasks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in visual generation fields. Thanks to the all-in-one capabilities of our model, we can easily build a multi-modal chat system that responds to any interactive request for image creation using a single model to serve as the backend, avoiding the cumbersome pipeline typically employed in visual agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Liu, Jiaxiang Ren, Ruoming Jin, Zijie Zhang, Yang Zhou, Patrick Valduriez, Dejing Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: As a promising paradigm to collaboratively train models with decentralized data, Federated Learning (FL) can be exploited to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs correspond to huge size, the scale of the training data significantly increases, which leads to tremendous amounts of computation and communication costs. The training data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which requires adaptive data processing within each device. Although Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can significantly reduce the scale of parameters to update in the fine-tuning process, it still takes unaffordable time to transfer the low-rank parameters of all the layers in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a Fisher Information-based Efficient Curriculum Federated Learning framework (FibecFed) with two novel methods, i.e., adaptive federated curriculum learning and efficient sparse parameter update. First, we propose a fisher information-based method to adaptively sample data within each device to improve the effectiveness of the FL fine-tuning process. Second, we dynamically select the proper layers for global aggregation and sparse parameters for local update with LoRA so as to improve the efficiency of the FL fine-tuning process. Extensive experimental results based on 10 datasets demonstrate that FibecFed yields excellent performance (up to 45.35% in terms of accuracy) and superb fine-tuning speed (up to 98.61% faster) compared with 17 baseline approaches).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyan Zhao, Heng Zhao, Bo Shen, Ali Payani, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Probing learned concepts in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how semantic knowledge is encoded internally. Training linear classifiers on probing tasks is a principle approach to denote the vector of a certain concept in the representation space. However, the single vector identified for a concept varies with both data and training, making it less robust and weakening its effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to approximate the subspace representing a specific concept. Built on linear probing classifiers, we extend the concept vectors into Gaussian Concept Subspace (GCS). We demonstrate GCS's effectiveness through measuring its faithfulness and plausibility across multiple LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Additionally, we use representation intervention tasks to showcase its efficacy in real-world applications such as emotion steering. Experimental results indicate that GCS concept vectors have the potential to balance steering performance and maintaining the fluency in natural language generation tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) as medical agents in Portuguese, aiming to develop a reliable and relevant virtual assistant for healthcare professionals. The HealthCareMagic-100k-en and MedQuAD datasets, translated from English using GPT-3.5, were used to fine-tune the ChatBode-7B model using the PEFT-QLoRA method. The InternLM2 model, with initial training on medical data, presented the best overall performance, with high precision and adequacy in metrics such as accuracy, completeness and safety. However, DrBode models, derived from ChatBode, exhibited a phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting of acquired medical knowledge. Despite this, these models performed frequently or even better in aspects such as grammaticality and coherence. A significant challenge was low inter-rater agreement, highlighting the need for more robust assessment protocols. This work paves the way for future research, such as evaluating multilingual models specific to the medical field, improving the quality of training data, and developing more consistent evaluation methodologies for the medical field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social media posts are frequently identified as a valuable source of open-source intelligence for disaster response, and pre-LLM NLP techniques have been evaluated on datasets of crisis tweets. We assess three commercial large language models (OpenAI GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5-flash-001 and Anthropic Claude-3-5 Sonnet) capabilities in zero-shot classification of short social media posts. In one prompt, the models are asked to perform two classification tasks: 1) identify if the post is informative in a humanitarian context; and 2) rank and provide probabilities for the post in relation to 16 possible humanitarian classes. The posts being classified are from the consolidated crisis tweet dataset, CrisisBench. Results are evaluated using macro, weighted, and binary F1-scores. The informative classification task, generally performed better without extra information, while for the humanitarian label classification providing the event that occurred during which the tweet was mined, resulted in better performance. Further, we found that the models have significantly varying performance by dataset, which raises questions about dataset quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning-based methods have achieved strong performance for quadrupedal locomotion. However, several challenges prevent quadrupeds from learning helpful indoor skills that require interaction with environments and humans: lack of end-effectors for manipulation, limited semantic understanding using only simulation data, and low traversability and reachability in indoor environments. We present a system for quadrupedal mobile manipulation in indoor environments. It uses a front-mounted gripper for object manipulation, a low-level controller trained in simulation using egocentric depth for agile skills like climbing and whole-body tilting, and pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with a third-person fisheye and an egocentric RGB camera for semantic understanding and command generation. We evaluate our system in two unseen environments without any real-world data collection or training. Our system can zero-shot generalize to these environments and complete tasks, like following user's commands to fetch a randomly placed stuff toy after climbing over a queen-sized bed, with a 60% success rate.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy I Skipper, Joanna Kuc, Greg Cooper, Christopher Timmermann</p>
<p>Abstract: How is language related to consciousness? Language functions to categorise perceptual experiences (e.g., labelling interoceptive states as 'happy') and higher-level constructs (e.g., using 'I' to represent the narrative self). Psychedelic use and meditation might be described as altered states that impair or intentionally modify the capacity for linguistic categorisation. For example, psychedelic phenomenology is often characterised by 'oceanic boundlessness' or 'unity' and 'ego dissolution', which might be expected of a system unburdened by entrenched language categories. If language breakdown plays a role in producing such altered behaviour, multimodal artificial intelligence might align more with these phenomenological descriptions when attention is shifted away from language. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the semantic embedding spaces from simulated altered states after manipulating attentional weights in CLIP and FLAVA models to embedding spaces from altered states questionnaires before manipulation. Compared to random text and various other altered states including anxiety, models were more aligned with disembodied, ego-less, spiritual, and unitive states, as well as minimal phenomenal experiences, with decreased attention to language and vision. Reduced attention to language was associated with distinct linguistic patterns and blurred embeddings within and, especially, across semantic categories (e.g., 'giraffes' become more like 'bananas'). These results lend support to the role of language categorisation in the phenomenology of altered states of consciousness, like those experienced with high doses of psychedelics or concentration meditation, states that often lead to improved mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability to generalize effectively across numerous industry domains while executing a range of tasks. Many of these competencies are obtained from the data utilized during the pre-training phase of the Language Models (LMs). However, these models exhibit limitations when tasked with performing in specialized or low-resource industry domains. More recent approaches use LLMs for generating domain-specific synthetic data but most often they lack in truthfulness and complexity. Alternatively, in cases where domain data is available like healthcare and finance most of the LMs are proprietary necessitating the need for a scalable method to curate real world industry specific pre-training data. In this work, we propose an automated and scalable framework - DoPAMine:Domain-specific Pre-training Adaptation from seed-guided data Mining, to mine domain specific training data from a large data corpus for domain adaptation of a LM. The framework leverages the parametric knowledge of a LLM to generate diverse and representative seed data tailored to a specific domain which is then used to mine real world data from a large data corpus like Common Crawl. We evaluated our framework's performance in the continual pre-training (CPT) setting by training two domain specific 7B parameter LMs in healthcare and finance with data mined via DoPAMine. Our experiments show that DoPAMine boosts the performance of pre-trained LLMs on average by 4.9% and 5.1% in zero-shot and 5-shot settings respectively on healthcare tasks from MMLU, MedQA, MedMCQA and PubMedQA datasets, and 2.9% and 6.7% for zero-shot and 5-shot settings respectively on finance tasks from FiQA-SA, FPB and Headlines datasets when compared to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Yuan, Vinkle Srivastav, Nassir Navab, Nicolas Padoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical video-language pretraining (VLP) faces unique challenges due to the knowledge domain gap and the scarcity of multi-modal data. This study aims to bridge the gap by addressing issues regarding textual information loss in surgical lecture videos and the spatial-temporal challenges of surgical VLP. We propose a hierarchical knowledge augmentation approach and a novel Procedure-Encoded Surgical Knowledge-Augmented Video-Language Pretraining (PeskaVLP) framework to tackle these issues. The knowledge augmentation uses large language models (LLM) for refining and enriching surgical concepts, thus providing comprehensive language supervision and reducing the risk of overfitting. PeskaVLP combines language supervision with visual self-supervision, constructing hard negative samples and employing a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based loss function to effectively comprehend the cross-modal procedural alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple public surgical scene understanding and cross-modal retrieval datasets show that our proposed method significantly improves zero-shot transferring performance and offers a generalist visual representation for further advancements in surgical scene understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachin Karmani, Thanushon Sivakaran, Gaurav Prasad, Mehmet Ali, Wenbo Yang, Sheyang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models often function as black boxes, providing no straightforward reasoning for their predictions. This is particularly true for computer vision models, which process tensors of pixel values to generate outcomes in tasks such as image classification and object detection. To elucidate the reasoning of these models, class activation maps (CAMs) are used to highlight salient regions that influence a model's output. This research introduces KPCA-CAM, a technique designed to enhance the interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) through improved class activation maps. KPCA-CAM leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the kernel trick to capture nonlinear relationships within CNN activations more effectively. By mapping data into higher-dimensional spaces with kernel functions and extracting principal components from this transformed hyperplane, KPCA-CAM provides more accurate representations of the underlying data manifold. This enables a deeper understanding of the features influencing CNN decisions. Empirical evaluations on the ILSVRC dataset across different CNN models demonstrate that KPCA-CAM produces more precise activation maps, providing clearer insights into the model's reasoning compared to existing CAM algorithms. This research advances CAM techniques, equipping researchers and practitioners with a powerful tool to gain deeper insights into CNN decision-making processes and overall behaviors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has shown promise in prompting virtual worlds into existence, yet little attention has been given to understanding how this process unfolds as social interaction. We present Social Conjurer, a framework for AI-augmented dynamic 3D scene co-creation, where multiple users collaboratively build and modify virtual worlds in real-time. Through an expanded set of interactions, including social and tool-based engagements as well as spatial reasoning, our framework facilitates the creation of rich, diverse virtual environments. Findings from a preliminary user study (N=12) provide insight into the user experience of this approach, how social contexts shape the prompting of spatial environments, and perspective on social applications of prompt-based 3D co-creation. In addition to highlighting the potential of AI-supported multi-user world creation and offering new pathways for AI-augmented creative processes in VR, this article presents a set of implications for designing human-centered interfaces that incorporate AI models into 3D content generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohaifa Khaldi, Domingo Alcaraz-Segura, Ignacio S\'anchez-Herrera, Javier Martinez-Lopez, Carlos Javier Navarro, Siham Tabik</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media images have shown to be a valuable source of information for understanding human interactions with important subjects such as cultural heritage, biodiversity and nature among others. The task of grouping such images into a number of semantically meaningful clusters without labels is challenging given the high diversity and complex nature of the visual content of these images in addition to their large volume. On the other hand, the last advances in Large Visual Models (LVM), Large Language Models (LLM) and Large Visual Language Models (LVLM) provide an important opportunity to explore new productive and scalable solutions. This works proposes, analyzes, and compares various approaches based on one or more state-of-the art LVM, LLM and LVLM, for mapping social media images into a number of pre-defined classes. As case study, we consider the problem of understanding the interactions between human and nature, also known as Nature's Contribution to People or Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). Our experiments reveal that the top-performing approaches, delivering highly competitive results, are the fine-tuned LVM DINOv2 on a small labeled dataset and LVLM models like the proprietary GPT-4 (gpt-4o-mini) using a simple prompt.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social dynamics in close human interactions pose significant challenges for Human Mesh Estimation (HME), particularly due to the complexity of physical contacts and the scarcity of training data. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel data generation method that utilizes Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to annotate contact maps which guide test-time optimization to produce paired image and pseudo-ground truth meshes. This methodology not only alleviates the annotation burden but also enables the assembly of a comprehensive dataset specifically tailored for close interactions in HME. Our Ask Pose Unite (APU) dataset, comprising over 6.2k human mesh pairs in contact covering diverse interaction types, is curated from images depicting naturalistic person-to-person scenes. We empirically show that using our dataset to train a diffusion-based contact prior, used as guidance during optimization, improves mesh estimation on unseen interactions. Our work addresses longstanding challenges of data scarcity for close interactions in HME enhancing the field's capabilities of handling complex interaction scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onur Vural, Shah Muhammad Hamdi, Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: Major solar flares are abrupt surges in the Sun's magnetic flux, presenting significant risks to technological infrastructure. In view of this, effectively predicting major flares from solar active region magnetic field data through machine learning methods becomes highly important in space weather research. Magnetic field data can be represented in multivariate time series modality where the data displays an extreme class imbalance due to the rarity of major flare events. In time series classification-based flare prediction, the use of contrastive representation learning methods has been relatively limited. In this paper, we introduce CONTREX, a novel contrastive representation learning approach for multivariate time series data, addressing challenges of temporal dependencies and extreme class imbalance. Our method involves extracting dynamic features from the multivariate time series instances, deriving two extremes from positive and negative class feature vectors that provide maximum separation capability, and training a sequence representation embedding module with the original multivariate time series data guided by our novel contrastive reconstruction loss to generate embeddings aligned with the extreme points. These embeddings capture essential time series characteristics and enhance discriminative power. Our approach shows promising solar flare prediction results on the Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF) multivariate time series benchmark dataset against baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: While recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology produce natural and expressive speech, they lack the option for users to select emotion and control intensity. We propose EmoKnob, a framework that allows fine-grained emotion control in speech synthesis with few-shot demonstrative samples of arbitrary emotion.

Based on the few-shot capability of our emotion control framework, we propose two methods to apply emotion control on emotions described by open-ended text, enabling an intuitive interface for controlling a diverse array of nuanced emotions. To facilitate a more systematic emotional speech synthesis field, we introduce a set of evaluation metrics designed to rigorously assess the faithfulness and recognizability of emotion control frameworks. Through objective and subjective evaluations, we show that our emotion control framework effectively embeds emotions into speech and surpasses emotion expressiveness of commercial TTS services.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enzyme design is a critical area in biotechnology, with applications ranging from drug development to synthetic biology. Traditional methods for enzyme function prediction or protein binding pocket design often fall short in capturing the dynamic and complex nature of enzyme-substrate interactions, particularly in catalytic processes. To address the challenges, we introduce EnzymeFlow, a generative model that employs flow matching with hierarchical pre-training and enzyme-reaction co-evolution to generate catalytic pockets for specific substrates and catalytic reactions. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale, curated, and validated dataset of enzyme-reaction pairs, specifically designed for the catalytic pocket generation task, comprising a total of $328,192$ pairs. By incorporating evolutionary dynamics and reaction-specific adaptations, EnzymeFlow becomes a powerful model for designing enzyme pockets, which is capable of catalyzing a wide range of biochemical reactions. Experiments on the new dataset demonstrate the model's effectiveness in designing high-quality, functional enzyme catalytic pockets, paving the way for advancements in enzyme engineering and synthetic biology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Franco, Mark Crovella</p>
<p>Abstract: Many papers have shown that attention heads work in conjunction with each other to perform complex tasks. It's frequently assumed that communication between attention heads is via the addition of specific features to token residuals. In this work we seek to isolate and identify the features used to effect communication and coordination among attention heads in GPT-2 small. Our key leverage on the problem is to show that these features are very often sparsely coded in the singular vectors of attention head matrices. We characterize the dimensionality and occurrence of these signals across the attention heads in GPT-2 small when used for the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. The sparse encoding of signals, as provided by attention head singular vectors, allows for efficient separation of signals from the residual background and straightforward identification of communication paths between attention heads. We explore the effectiveness of this approach by tracing portions of the circuits used in the IOI task. Our traces reveal considerable detail not present in previous studies, shedding light on the nature of redundant paths present in GPT-2. And our traces go beyond previous work by identifying features used to communicate between attention heads when performing IOI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changlin Li, Jiawei Zhang, Sihao Lin, Zongxin Yang, Junwei Liang, Xiaodan Liang, Xiaojun Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Vision Models (LVMs), such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and diffusion models, have led to an increasing demand for computational resources, resulting in substantial financial and environmental costs. This growing challenge highlights the necessity of developing efficient training methods for LVMs. Progressive learning, a training strategy in which model capacity gradually increases during training, has shown potential in addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present an advanced automated progressive learning (AutoProg) framework for efficient training of LVMs. We begin by focusing on the pre-training of LVMs, using ViTs as a case study, and propose AutoProg-One, an AutoProg scheme featuring momentum growth (MoGrow) and a one-shot growth schedule search. Beyond pre-training, we extend our approach to tackle transfer learning and fine-tuning of LVMs. We expand the scope of AutoProg to cover a wider range of LVMs, including diffusion models. First, we introduce AutoProg-Zero, by enhancing the AutoProg framework with a novel zero-shot unfreezing schedule search, eliminating the need for one-shot supernet training. Second, we introduce a novel Unique Stage Identifier (SID) scheme to bridge the gap during network growth. These innovations, integrated with the core principles of AutoProg, offer a comprehensive solution for efficient training across various LVM scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AutoProg accelerates ViT pre-training by up to 1.85x on ImageNet and accelerates fine-tuning of diffusion models by up to 2.86x, with comparable or even higher performance. This work provides a robust and scalable approach to efficient training of LVMs, with potential applications in a wide range of vision tasks. Code: https://github.com/changlin31/AutoProg-Zero</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Peng, Xufan Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) have been widely spread across all domains. However, the basic abilities such as the controllability of LLMs are still limited. To address this, we propose "Self-controller", a novel agentic framework bringing self-awareness into LLMs' reasoning logic. The core idea of this work is to maintain states based on the LLM's response, letting the LLM become self-aware of current status and think step by step in a multi-round chain-of-thought paradigm. Our experiment on the state of textual length has shown the controllability and effectiveness of the Self-controller. We further implement a binary search algorithm to accelerate the generation process based on the linearity and monotonicity of the textual length state. Another advantage of the Self-controller comes with DeepSeek's Context Caching technology, which significantly saves computational token consumption when a cluster of conversations shares the same prefix of context. Theoretically, we prove that in this scenario the extra time complexity is $O(c \log n)$. Results of the back-of-the-envelope estimation suggest that the token consumption of our method is no more than twice as much as that of the trivial single-round generation. Furthermore, our ablation study on word constraints demonstrates the Self-controller's consistent controllability across all foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhidong Gao, Yu Zhang, Zhenxiao Zhang, Yanmin Gong, Yuanxiong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite demonstrating superior performance across a variety of linguistic tasks, pre-trained large language models (LMs) often require fine-tuning on specific datasets to effectively address different downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning these LMs for downstream tasks necessitates collecting data from individuals, which raises significant privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as the de facto solution, enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. While promising, federated fine-tuning of large LMs faces significant challenges, including restricted access to model parameters and high computation, communication, and memory overhead. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{P}roxy-\textbf{T}uning (FedPT), a novel framework for federated fine-tuning of black-box large LMs, requiring access only to their predictions over the output vocabulary instead of their parameters. Specifically, devices in FedPT first collaboratively tune a smaller LM, and then the server combines the knowledge learned by the tuned small LM with the knowledge learned by the larger pre-trained LM to construct a large proxy-tuned LM that can reach the performance of directly tuned large LMs. The experimental results demonstrate that FedPT can significantly reduce computation, communication, and memory overhead while maintaining competitive performance compared to directly federated fine-tuning of large LMs. FedPT offers a promising solution for efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of large LMs on resource-constrained devices, broadening the accessibility and applicability of state-of-the-art large LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjun Wang, Jiyuan Chen, Tong Pan, Zheng Dong, Lingyu Zhang, Renhe Jiang, Xuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated promising potential for traffic forecasting by effectively capturing both temporal and spatial correlations. The generalization ability of spatiotemporal models has received considerable attention in recent scholarly discourse. However, no substantive datasets specifically addressing traffic out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios have been proposed. Existing ST-OOD methods are either constrained to testing on extant data or necessitate manual modifications to the dataset. Consequently, the generalization capacity of current spatiotemporal models in OOD scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art models using newly proposed traffic OOD benchmarks and, surprisingly, find that these models experience a significant decline in performance. Through meticulous analysis, we attribute this decline to the models' inability to adapt to previously unobserved spatial relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, which learns a set of graph generators (i.e., graphons) during training and adaptively combines them to generate new graphs based on novel environmental conditions to handle spatial distribution shifts during testing. We further extend this concept to the Transformer architecture, achieving substantial improvements. Our method is both parsimonious and efficacious, and can be seamlessly integrated into any spatiotemporal model, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches in addressing spatial dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in artificial intelligence which can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens and patient wait times. Despite significant progress, we believe that the task has reached a bottleneck due to the limited benchmark datasets and the existing large models' insufficient capability enhancements in this specialized domain. Specifically, the recently released CheXpert Plus dataset lacks comparative evaluation algorithms and their results, providing only the dataset itself. This situation makes the training, evaluation, and comparison of subsequent algorithms challenging. Thus, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of existing mainstream X-ray report generation models and large language models (LLMs), on the CheXpert Plus dataset. We believe that the proposed benchmark can provide a solid comparative basis for subsequent algorithms and serve as a guide for researchers to quickly grasp the state-of-the-art models in this field. More importantly, we propose a large model for the X-ray image report generation using a multi-stage pre-training strategy, including self-supervised autoregressive generation and Xray-report contrastive learning, and supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results indicate that the autoregressive pre-training based on Mamba effectively encodes X-ray images, and the image-text contrastive pre-training further aligns the feature spaces, achieving better experimental results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Liu, James Doss-Gollin, Guha Balakrishnan, Ashok Veeraraghavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding local risks from extreme rainfall, such as flooding, requires both long records (to sample rare events) and high-resolution products (to assess localized hazards). Unfortunately, there is a dearth of long-record and high-resolution products that can be used to understand local risk and precipitation science. In this paper, we present a novel generative diffusion model that downscales (super-resolves) globally available Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gauge-based precipitation products and ERA5 reanalysis data to generate kilometer-scale precipitation estimates. Downscaling gauge-based precipitation from 55 km to 1 km while recovering extreme rainfall signals poses significant challenges. To enforce our model (named WassDiff) to produce well-calibrated precipitation intensity values, we introduce a Wasserstein Distance Regularization (WDR) term for the score-matching training objective in the diffusion denoising process. We show that WDR greatly enhances the model's ability to capture extreme values compared to diffusion without WDR. Extensive evaluation shows that WassDiff has better reconstruction accuracy and bias scores than conventional score-based diffusion models. Case studies of extreme weather phenomena, like tropical storms and cold fronts, demonstrate WassDiff's ability to produce appropriate spatial patterns while capturing extremes. Such downscaling capability enables the generation of extensive km-scale precipitation datasets from existing historical global gauge records and current gauge measurements in areas without high-resolution radar.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjun Wang, Jiyuan Chen, Tong Pan, Zheng Dong, Lingyu Zhang, Renhe Jiang, Xuan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Traffic forecasting is a cornerstone of smart city management, enabling efficient resource allocation and transportation planning. Deep learning, with its ability to capture complex nonlinear patterns in spatiotemporal (ST) data, has emerged as a powerful tool for traffic forecasting. While graph neural networks (GCNs) and transformer-based models have shown promise, their computational demands often hinder their application to real-world road networks, particularly those with large-scale spatiotemporal interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatiotemporal graph transformer (STGformer) architecture. STGformer effectively balances the strengths of GCNs and Transformers, enabling efficient modeling of both global and local traffic patterns while maintaining a manageable computational footprint. Unlike traditional approaches that require multiple attention layers, STG attention block captures high-order spatiotemporal interactions in a single layer, significantly reducing computational cost. In particular, STGformer achieves a 100x speedup and a 99.8\% reduction in GPU memory usage compared to STAEformer during batch inference on a California road graph with 8,600 sensors. We evaluate STGformer on the LargeST benchmark and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art Transformer-based methods such as PDFormer and STAEformer, which underline STGformer's potential to revolutionize traffic forecasting by overcoming the computational and memory limitations of existing approaches, making it a promising foundation for future spatiotemporal modeling tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhargav Shandilya, Alexis Palmer</p>
<p>Abstract: The data and compute requirements of current language modeling technology pose challenges for the processing and analysis of low-resource languages. Declarative linguistic knowledge has the potential to partially bridge this data scarcity gap by providing models with useful inductive bias in the form of language-specific rules. In this paper, we propose a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework backed by a large language model (LLM) to correct the output of a smaller model for the linguistic task of morphological glossing. We leverage linguistic information to make up for the lack of data and trainable parameters, while allowing for inputs from written descriptive grammars interpreted and distilled through an LLM.
  The results demonstrate that significant leaps in performance and efficiency are possible with the right combination of: a) linguistic inputs in the form of grammars, b) the interpretive power of LLMs, and c) the trainability of smaller token classification networks. We show that a compact, RAG-supported model is highly effective in data-scarce settings, achieving a new state-of-the-art for this task and our target languages. Our work also offers documentary linguists a more reliable and more usable tool for morphological glossing by providing well-reasoned explanations and confidence scores for each output.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00393">Revisiting Essential and Nonessential Settings of Evidential Deep Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyuan Chen, Junyu Gao, Changsheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) is an emerging method for uncertainty estimation that provides reliable predictive uncertainty in a single forward pass, attracting significant attention. Grounded in subjective logic, EDL derives Dirichlet concentration parameters from neural networks to construct a Dirichlet probability density function (PDF), modeling the distribution of class probabilities. Despite its success, EDL incorporates several nonessential settings: In model construction, (1) a commonly ignored prior weight parameter is fixed to the number of classes, while its value actually impacts the balance between the proportion of evidence and its magnitude in deriving predictive scores. In model optimization, (2) the empirical risk features a variance-minimizing optimization term that biases the PDF towards a Dirac delta function, potentially exacerbating overconfidence. (3) Additionally, the structural risk typically includes a KL-divergence-minimizing regularization, whose optimization direction extends beyond the intended purpose and contradicts common sense, diminishing the information carried by the evidence magnitude. Therefore, we propose Re-EDL, a simplified yet more effective variant of EDL, by relaxing the nonessential settings and retaining the essential one, namely, the adoption of projected probability from subjective logic. Specifically, Re-EDL treats the prior weight as an adjustable hyperparameter rather than a fixed scalar, and directly optimizes the expectation of the Dirichlet PDF provided by deprecating both the variance-minimizing optimization term and the divergence regularization term. Extensive experiments and state-of-the-art performance validate the effectiveness of our method. The source code is available at https://github.com/MengyuanChen21/Re-EDL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mazen Balat, Mahmoud Essam Gabr, Hend Bakr, Ahmed B. Zaky</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of short-form videos on platforms like TikTok has brought new challenges in safeguarding young viewers from inappropriate content. Traditional moderation methods often fall short in handling the vast and rapidly changing landscape of user-generated videos, increasing the risk of children encountering harmful material. This paper introduces TikGuard, a transformer-based deep learning approach aimed at detecting and flagging content unsuitable for children on TikTok. By using a specially curated dataset, TikHarm, and leveraging advanced video classification techniques, TikGuard achieves an accuracy of 86.7%, showing a notable improvement over existing methods in similar contexts. While direct comparisons are limited by the uniqueness of the TikHarm dataset, TikGuard's performance highlights its potential in enhancing content moderation, contributing to a safer online experience for minors. This study underscores the effectiveness of transformer models in video classification and sets a foundation for future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Ohayon, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad</p>
<p>Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulation has enabled unprecedented compute-scalable approaches to robot learning. However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a narrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling generalizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3, the fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich physics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation. ManiSkill3 also provides a comprehensive set of baselines that span popular RL and learning-from-demonstrations algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Xiong, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Rui Zhang, Yuhong Guo, Junping Zhao, Ke Zhang, Zhenxuan Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 11x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7\%, significantly enhancing the user experience</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chanhui Lee, Dae-Woong Jeong, Sung Moon Ko, Sumin Lee, Hyunseung Kim, Soorin Yim, Sehui Han, Sungwoong Kim, Sungbin Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecules have a number of distinct properties whose importance and application vary. Often, in reality, labels for some properties are hard to achieve despite their practical importance. A common solution to such data scarcity is to use models of good generalization with transfer learning. This involves domain experts for designing source and target tasks whose features are shared. However, this approach has limitations: i). Difficulty in accurate design of source-target task pairs due to the large number of tasks, and ii). corresponding computational burden verifying many trials and errors of transfer learning design, thereby iii). constraining the potential of foundation modeling of multi-task molecular property prediction. We address the limitations of the manual design of transfer learning via data-driven bi-level optimization. The proposed method enables scalable multi-task transfer learning for molecular property prediction by automatically obtaining the optimal transfer ratios. Empirically, the proposed method improved the prediction performance of 40 molecular properties and accelerated training convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhao, Zhe Li, Yige Li, Jun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant ongoing efforts in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 3 remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that can induce harmful behaviors, including those triggered by adversarial suffixes. Building on prior research, we hypothesize that these adversarial suffixes are not mere bugs but may represent features that can dominate the LLM's behavior. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conduct several experiments. First, we demonstrate that benign features can be effectively made to function as adversarial suffixes, i.e., we develop a feature extraction method to extract sample-agnostic features from benign dataset in the form of suffixes and show that these suffixes may effectively compromise safety alignment. Second, we show that adversarial suffixes generated from jailbreak attacks may contain meaningful features, i.e., appending the same suffix to different prompts results in responses exhibiting specific characteristics. Third, we show that such benign-yet-safety-compromising features can be easily introduced through fine-tuning using only benign datasets, i.e., even in the absence of harmful content. This highlights the critical risk posed by dominating benign features in the training data and calls for further research to reinforce LLM safety alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroaki Chiba-Okabe</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach to analyzing copyright infringement disputes by formalizing relevant judicial principles within a coherent framework based on the random-worlds method. The approach provides a structured analysis of key evidentiary principles, with particular emphasis on the "inverse ratio rule"--a controversial doctrine adopted by some courts. Although this rule has faced significant criticism, a formal proof demonstrates its validity, provided it is properly defined. Additionally, the paper examines the heightened copyright risks posed by generative AI, highlighting how extensive access to copyrighted material by generative models increases the risk of infringement. Utilizing the probabilistic approach, the Near Access-Free (NAF) condition, previously proposed as a potential mitigation strategy, is evaluated. The analysis reveals that while the NAF condition mitigates some infringement risks, its justifiability and efficacy are questionable in certain contexts. These findings demonstrate how a rigorous probabilistic approach can advance our understanding of copyright jurisprudence and its interaction with emerging technologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling the creation of highly-realistic and detailed images. In this study, we propose a novel Mask Conditional Text-to-Image Generative Model (MCGM) that leverages the power of conditional diffusion models to generate pictures with specific poses. Our model builds upon the success of the Break-a-scene [1] model in generating new scenes using a single image with multiple subjects and incorporates a mask embedding injection that allows the conditioning of the generation process. By introducing this additional level of control, MCGM offers a flexible and intuitive approach for generating specific poses for one or more subjects learned from a single image, empowering users to influence the output based on their requirements. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in generating high-quality images that meet predefined mask conditions and improving the current Break-a-scene generative model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based quadruped robots excel across various terrains but still lack the ability to swim in water due to the complex underwater environment. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a data-driven hydrodynamic model for amphibious quadruped robots, aiming to enhance their adaptive capabilities in complex and dynamic underwater environments. The proposed model leverages Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) combined with attention mechanisms to accurately process and interpret real-time sensor data. The model enables the quadruped robots to understand and predict complex environmental patterns, facilitating robust decision-making strategies. We harness real-time sensor data, capturing various environmental and internal state parameters to train and evaluate our model. A significant focus of our evaluation involves testing the quadruped robot's performance across different hydrodynamic conditions and assessing its capabilities at varying speeds and fluid dynamic conditions. The outcomes suggest that the model can effectively learn and adapt to varying conditions, enabling the prediction of force states and enhancing autonomous robotic behaviors in various practical scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in preference alignment have significantly improved Large Language Models' ability to generate texts that align with human preferences and values. However, current alignment metrics typically emphasize the post-hoc overall improvement, while overlooking a critical aspect: regression, which refers to the backsliding on previously correctly-handled data after updates. This potential pitfall may arise from excessive fine-tuning on already well-aligned data, which subsequently leads to over-alignment and degeneration. To address this challenge, we propose FlipGuard, a constrained optimization approach to detect and mitigate update regression with focal attention. Specifically, FlipGuard identifies performance degradation using a customized reward characterization and strategically enforces a constraint to encourage conditional congruence with the pre-aligned model during training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FlipGuard effectively alleviates update regression while demonstrating excellent overall performance, with the added benefit of knowledge preservation while aligning preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchi Ishikawa, Tatsuya Komatsu, Yoshimitsu Aoki</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose to pre-train audio encoders using synthetic patterns instead of real audio data. Our proposed framework consists of two key elements. The first one is Masked Autoencoder (MAE), a self-supervised learning framework that learns from reconstructing data from randomly masked counterparts. MAEs tend to focus on low-level information such as visual patterns and regularities within data. Therefore, it is unimportant what is portrayed in the input, whether it be images, audio mel-spectrograms, or even synthetic patterns. This leads to the second key element, which is synthetic data. Synthetic data, unlike real audio, is free from privacy and licensing infringement issues. By combining MAEs and synthetic patterns, our framework enables the model to learn generalized feature representations without real data, while addressing the issues related to real audio. To evaluate the efficacy of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments across a total of 13 audio tasks and 17 synthetic datasets. The experiments provide insights into which types of synthetic patterns are effective for audio. Our results demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to models pre-trained on AudioSet-2M and partially outperforms image-based pre-training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent efforts have aimed to utilize multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) to extend semantic parsing (SP) across multiple languages without requiring extensive annotations. However, achieving zero-shot cross-lingual transfer for SP remains challenging, leading to a performance gap between source and target languages. In this study, we propose Cross-Lingual Back-Parsing (CBP), a novel data augmentation methodology designed to enhance cross-lingual transfer for SP. Leveraging the representation geometry of the mPLMs, CBP synthesizes target language utterances from source meaning representations. Our methodology effectively performs cross-lingual data augmentation in challenging zero-resource settings, by utilizing only labeled data in the source language and monolingual corpora. Extensive experiments on two cross-language SP benchmarks (Mschema2QA and Xspider) demonstrate that CBP brings substantial gains in the target language. Further analysis of the synthesized utterances shows that our method successfully generates target language utterances with high slot value alignment rates while preserving semantic integrity.

<p>Abstract: Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) has evolved into a highly promising issue owing to the latest breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), among other reasons. This emerging growth increases the need to design multi-agent algorithms that can manage also human preferences. This paper presents an extension of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) meta-heuristic to solve the Minimum Time Search (MTS) task, in the case where humans and robots perform an object searching task together. The proposed model consists of two main blocks. The first one is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that provides the prior probabilities about where an object may be from a segmented image. The second one is the Sub-prior MTS-ACO algorithm (SP-MTS-ACO), which takes as inputs the prior probabilities and the particular search preferences of the agents in different sub-priors to generate search plans for all agents. The model has been tested in real experiments for the joint search of an object through a Vizanti web-based visualization in a tablet computer. The designed interface allows the communication between a human and our humanoid robot named IVO. The obtained results show an improvement in the search perception of the users without loss of efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning a model of a stochastic setting often involves learning both general structure rules and specific properties of the instance. This paper investigates the interplay between learning the general and the specific in various learning methods, with emphasis on sample efficiency. We design a framework called {\sc LeverWorlds}, which allows the generation of simple physics-inspired worlds that follow a similar generative process with different distributions, and their instances can be expressed in natural language. These worlds allow for controlled experiments to assess the sample complexity of different learning methods. We experiment with classic learning algorithms as well as Transformer language models, both with fine-tuning and In-Context Learning (ICL). Our general finding is that (1) Transformers generally succeed in the task; but (2) they are considerably less sample efficient than classic methods that make stronger assumptions about the structure, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Logistic Regression. This finding is in tension with the recent tendency to use Transformers as general-purpose estimators. We propose an approach that leverages the ICL capabilities of contemporary language models to apply simple algorithms for this type of data. Our experiments show that models currently struggle with the task but show promising potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonghang Li, Wenjiao Feng, Mohsen Guizani, Hongfang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large model inference is shifting from cloud to edge due to concerns about the privacy of user interaction data. However, edge devices often struggle with limited computing power, memory, and bandwidth, requiring collaboration across multiple devices to run and speed up LLM inference. Pipeline parallelism, the mainstream solution, is inefficient for single-user scenarios, while tensor parallelism struggles with frequent communications. In this paper, we argue that tensor parallelism can be more effective than pipeline on low-resource devices, and present a compute- and memory-efficient tensor parallel inference system, named TPI-LLM, to serve 70B-scale models. TPI-LLM keeps sensitive raw data local in the users' devices and introduces a sliding window memory scheduler to dynamically manage layer weights during inference, with disk I/O latency overlapped with the computation and communication. This allows larger models to run smoothly on memory-limited devices. We analyze the communication bottleneck and find that link latency, not bandwidth, emerges as the main issue, so a star-based allreduce algorithm is implemented. Through extensive experiments on both emulated and real testbeds, TPI-LLM demonstrated over 80% less time-to-first-token and token latency compared to Accelerate, and over 90% compared to Transformers and Galaxy, while cutting the peak memory footprint of Llama 2-70B by 90%, requiring only 3.1 GB of memory for 70B-scale models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco N. F. Q. Simoes, Mehdi Dastani, Thijs van Ommen</p>
<p>Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct representations that simplify parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach in representation learning that compresses random variables while retaining information about a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces representations which are causally interpretable, and which can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned representations accurately capture causality as intended.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate assessment of disease severity from endoscopy videos in ulcerative colitis (UC) is crucial for evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials. Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Luo, Xin Li, Hongzhan Lin, Jing Ma, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive performance of proprietary LLMs like GPT4 in code generation has led to a trend to replicate these capabilities in open-source models through knowledge distillation (e.g. Code Evol-Instruct). However, these efforts often neglect the crucial aspect of response quality, relying heavily on teacher models for direct response distillation. This paradigm, especially for complex instructions, can degrade the quality of synthesized data, compromising the knowledge distillation process. To this end, our study introduces the Adaptive Modular Response Evolution (AMR-Evol) framework, which employs a two-stage process to refine response distillation. The first stage, modular decomposition, breaks down the direct response into more manageable sub-modules. The second stage, adaptive response evolution, automatically evolves the response with the related function modules. Our experiments with three popular code benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, and EvalPlus) attest to the superiority of the AMR-Evol framework over baseline response distillation methods. By comparing with the open-source Code LLMs trained on a similar scale of data, we observed performance enhancements: more than +3.0 points on HumanEval-Plus and +1.0 points on MBPP-Plus, which underscores the effectiveness of our framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Cheng, Ruixi Qiao, Gang Xiong, Qinghai Miao, Yingwei Ma, Binhua Li, Yongbin Li, Yisheng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose an provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data corresponding to about 4 trajectories per game, which demonstrates superior generalization of JOWA. We will release codes at https://github.com/CJReinforce/JOWA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geng Li, Haozhi Cao, Mingyang Liu, Shenghai Yuan, Jianfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Point cloud registration aims to provide estimated transformations to align point clouds, which plays a crucial role in pose estimation of various navigation systems, such as surgical guidance systems and autonomous vehicles. Despite the impressive performance of recent models on benchmark datasets, many rely on complex modules like KPConv and Transformers, which impose significant computational and memory demands. These requirements hinder their practical application, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile robotics. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud registration network that leverages a pure MLP architecture, constructing geometric information offline. This approach eliminates the computational and memory burdens associated with traditional complex feature extractors and significantly reduces inference time and resource consumption. Our method is the first to replace 3D coordinate inputs with offline-constructed geometric encoding, improving generalization and stability, as demonstrated by Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) comparisons. This efficient and accurate geometric representation marks a significant advancement in point cloud analysis, particularly for applications requiring fast and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Volumetric modeling and neural radiance field representations have revolutionized 3D face capture and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However, these methods often require hundreds of multi-view input images and are thus inapplicable to cases with less than a handful of inputs. We present a novel volumetric prior on human faces that allows for high-fidelity expressive face modeling from as few as three input views captured in the wild. Our key insight is that an implicit prior trained on synthetic data alone can generalize to extremely challenging real-world identities and expressions and render novel views with fine idiosyncratic details like wrinkles and eyelashes. We leverage a 3D Morphable Face Model to synthesize a large training set, rendering each identity with different expressions, hair, clothing, and other assets. We then train a conditional Neural Radiance Field prior on this synthetic dataset and, at inference time, fine-tune the model on a very sparse set of real images of a single subject. On average, the fine-tuning requires only three inputs to cross the synthetic-to-real domain gap. The resulting personalized 3D model reconstructs strong idiosyncratic facial expressions and outperforms the state-of-the-art in high-quality novel view synthesis of faces from sparse inputs in terms of perceptual and photo-metric quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the Language Aided Subset Sampling Based Motion Planner (LASMP), a system that helps mobile robots plan their movements by using natural language instructions. LASMP uses a modified version of the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) method, which is guided by user-provided commands processed through a language model (RoBERTa). The system improves efficiency by focusing on specific areas of the robot's workspace based on these instructions, making it faster and less resource-intensive. Compared to traditional RRT methods, LASMP reduces the number of nodes needed by 55% and cuts random sample queries by 80%, while still generating safe, collision-free paths. Tested in both simulated and real-world environments, LASMP has shown better performance in handling complex indoor scenarios. The results highlight the potential of combining language processing with motion planning to make robot navigation more efficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: Public opinion on recommender systems has become increasingly wary in recent years. In line with this trend, lawmakers have also started to become more critical of such systems, resulting in the introduction of new laws focusing on aspects such as privacy, fairness, and explainability for recommender systems and AI at large. These concepts are especially crucial in high-risk domains such as recruitment. In recruitment specifically, decisions carry substantial weight, as the outcomes can significantly impact individuals' careers and companies' success. Additionally, there is a need for a multi-stakeholder approach, as these systems are used by job seekers, recruiters, and companies simultaneously, each with its own requirements and expectations. In this paper, I summarize my current research on the topic of explainable, multi-stakeholder job recommender systems and set out a number of future research directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pradip Pramanick, Silvia Rossi</p>
<p>Abstract: The explainability of a robot's actions is crucial to its acceptance in social spaces. Explaining why a robot fails to complete a given task is particularly important for non-expert users to be aware of the robot's capabilities and limitations. So far, research on explaining robot failures has only considered generating textual explanations, even though several studies have shown the benefits of multimodal ones. However, a simple combination of multiple modalities may lead to semantic incoherence between the information across different modalities - a problem that is not well-studied. An incoherent multimodal explanation can be difficult to understand, and it may even become inconsistent with what the robot and the human observe and how they perform reasoning with the observations. Such inconsistencies may lead to wrong conclusions about the robot's capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an approach to generate coherent multimodal explanations by checking the logical coherence of explanations from different modalities, followed by refinements as required. We propose a classification approach for coherence assessment, where we evaluate if an explanation logically follows another. Our experiments suggest that fine-tuning a neural network that was pre-trained to recognize textual entailment, performs well for coherence assessment of multimodal explanations.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents an Arabic Alphabet Sign Language recognition approach, using deep learning methods in conjunction with transfer learning and transformer-based models. We study the performance of the different variants on two publicly available datasets, namely ArSL2018 and AASL. This task will make full use of state-of-the-art CNN architectures like ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB7, and the latest transformer models such as Google ViT and Microsoft Swin Transformer. These pre-trained models have been fine-tuned on the above datasets in an attempt to capture some unique features of Arabic sign language motions. Experimental results present evidence that the suggested methodology can receive a high recognition accuracy, by up to 99.6\% and 99.43\% on ArSL2018 and AASL, respectively. That is far beyond the previously reported state-of-the-art approaches. This performance opens up even more avenues for communication that may be more accessible to Arabic-speaking deaf and hard-of-hearing, and thus encourages an inclusive society.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of accurately translating technical terms, which are crucial for clear communication in specialized fields. We introduce the Parenthetical Terminology Translation (PTT) task, designed to mitigate potential inaccuracies by displaying the original term in parentheses alongside its translation. To implement this approach, we generated a representative PTT dataset using a collaborative approach with large language models and applied knowledge distillation to fine-tune traditional Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models and small-sized Large Language Models (sLMs). Additionally, we developed a novel evaluation metric to assess both overall translation accuracy and the correct parenthetical presentation of terms. Our findings indicate that sLMs did not consistently outperform NMT models, with fine-tuning proving more effective than few-shot prompting, particularly in models with continued pre-training in the target language. These insights contribute to the advancement of more reliable terminology translation methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quan Nguyen, Nishant A. Mehta, Crist\'obal Guzm\'an</p>
<p>Abstract: The minimax sample complexity of group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) has been determined up to a $\log(K)$ factor, for $K$ the number of groups. In this work, we venture beyond the minimax perspective via a novel notion of sparsity that we dub $(\lambda, \beta)$-sparsity. In short, this condition means that at any parameter $\theta$, there is a set of at most $\beta$ groups whose risks at $\theta$ all are at least $\lambda$ larger than the risks of the other groups. To find an $\epsilon$-optimal $\theta$, we show via a novel algorithm and analysis that the $\epsilon$-dependent term in the sample complexity can swap a linear dependence on $K$ for a linear dependence on the potentially much smaller $\beta$. This improvement leverages recent progress in sleeping bandits, showing a fundamental connection between the two-player zero-sum game optimization framework for GDRO and per-action regret bounds in sleeping bandits. The aforementioned result assumes having a particular $\lambda$ as input. Perhaps surprisingly, we next show an adaptive algorithm which, up to log factors, gets sample complexity that adapts to the best $(\lambda, \beta)$-sparsity condition that holds. Finally, for a particular input $\lambda$, we also show how to get a dimension-free sample complexity result.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saurav Jha, Shiqi Yang, Masato Ishii, Mengjie Zhao, Christian Simon, Jehanzeb Mirza, Dong Gong, Lina Yao, Shusuke Takahashi, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized text-to-image diffusion models have grown popular for their ability to efficiently acquire a new concept from user-defined text descriptions and a few images. However, in the real world, a user may wish to personalize a model on multiple concepts but one at a time, with no access to the data from previous concepts due to storage/privacy concerns. When faced with this continual learning (CL) setup, most personalization methods fail to find a balance between acquiring new concepts and retaining previous ones -- a challenge that continual personalization (CP) aims to solve. Inspired by the successful CL methods that rely on class-specific information for regularization, we resort to the inherent class-conditioned density estimates, also known as diffusion classifier (DC) scores, for continual personalization of text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, we propose using DC scores for regularizing the parameter-space and function-space of text-to-image diffusion models, to achieve continual personalization. Using several diverse evaluation setups, datasets, and metrics, we show that our proposed regularization-based CP methods outperform the state-of-the-art C-LoRA, and other baselines. Finally, by operating in the replay-free CL setup and on low-rank adapters, our method incurs zero storage and parameter overhead, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vihang Patil, Markus Hofmarcher, Elisabeth Rumetshofer, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning agents with reinforcement learning is difficult when dealing with long trajectories that involve a large number of states. To address these learning problems effectively, the number of states can be reduced by abstract representations that cluster states. In principle, deep reinforcement learning can find abstract states, but end-to-end learning is unstable. We propose contrastive abstraction learning to find abstract states, where we assume that successive states in a trajectory belong to the same abstract state. Such abstract states may be basic locations, achieved subgoals, inventory, or health conditions. Contrastive abstraction learning first constructs clusters of state representations by contrastive learning and then applies modern Hopfield networks to determine the abstract states. The first phase of contrastive abstraction learning is self-supervised learning, where contrastive learning forces states with sequential proximity to have similar representations. The second phase uses modern Hopfield networks to map similar state representations to the same fixed point, i.e.\ to an abstract state. The level of abstraction can be adjusted by determining the number of fixed points of the modern Hopfield network. Furthermore, \textit{contrastive abstraction learning} does not require rewards and facilitates efficient reinforcement learning for a wide range of downstream tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of contrastive abstraction learning for reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Protein-ligand binding is the process by which a small molecule (drug or inhibitor) attaches to a target protein. The binding affinity, which refers to the strength of this interaction, is central to many important problems in bioinformatics such as drug design. An extensive amount of work has been devoted to predicting binding affinity over the past decades due to its significance. In this paper, we review all significant recent works, focusing on the methods, features, and benchmark datasets. We have observed a rising trend in the use of traditional machine learning and deep learning models for predicting binding affinity, accompanied by an increasing amount of data on proteins and small drug-like molecules. While prediction results are constantly improving, we also identify several open questions and potential directions that remain unexplored in the field. This paper could serve as an excellent starting point for machine learning researchers who wish to engage in the study of binding affinity, or for anyone with general interests in machine learning, drug discovery, and bioinformatics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyogo Hiruma, Hiroshi Ito, Tetusya Ogata</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty of environments has long been a difficult characteristic to handle, when performing real-world robot tasks. This is because the uncertainty produces unexpected observations that cannot be covered by manual scripting. Learning based robot controlling methods are a promising approach for generating flexible motions against unknown situations, but still tend to suffer under uncertainty due to its deterministic nature. In order to adaptively perform the target task under such conditions, the robot control model must be able to accurately understand the possible uncertainty, and to exploratively derive the optimal action that minimizes such uncertainty. This paper extended an existing predictive learning based robot control method, which employ foresight prediction using dynamic internal simulation. The foresight module refines the model's hidden states by sampling multiple possible futures and replace with the one that led to the lower future uncertainty. The adaptiveness of the model was evaluated on a door opening task. The door can be opened either by pushing, pulling, or sliding, but robot cannot visually distinguish which way, and is required to adapt on the fly. The results showed that the proposed model adaptively diverged its motion through interaction with the door, whereas conventional methods failed to stably diverge. The models were analyzed on Lyapunov exponents of RNN hidden states which reflect the possible divergence at each time step during task execution. The result indicated that the foresight module biased the model to consider future consequences, which lead to embedding uncertainties at the policy of the robot controller, rather than the resultant observation. This is beneficial for implementing adaptive behaviors, which indices derivation of diverse motion during exploration.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong adaptability to various real-world challenges, with architectures such as Vision GNN (ViG) achieving state-of-the-art performance in several computer vision tasks. However, their practical applicability is hindered by the computational complexity of constructing the graph, which scales quadratically with the image size. In this paper, we introduce a novel Windowed vision Graph neural Network (WiGNet) model for efficient image processing. WiGNet explores a different strategy from previous works by partitioning the image into windows and constructing a graph within each window. Therefore, our model uses graph convolutions instead of the typical 2D convolution or self-attention mechanism. WiGNet effectively manages computational and memory complexity for large image sizes. We evaluate our method in the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset and test the adaptability of WiGNet using the CelebA-HQ dataset as a downstream task with higher-resolution images. In both of these scenarios, our method achieves competitive results compared to previous vision GNNs while keeping memory and computational complexity at bay. WiGNet offers a promising solution toward the deployment of vision GNNs in real-world applications. We publicly released the code at https://github.com/EIDOSLAB/WiGNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunze Liu, Li Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba has achieved significant advantages in long-context modeling and autoregressive tasks, but its scalability with large parameters remains a major limitation in vision applications. pretraining is a widely used strategy to enhance backbone model performance. Although the success of Masked Autoencoder in Transformer pretraining is well recognized, it does not significantly improve Mamba's visual learning performance. We found that using the correct autoregressive pretraining can significantly boost the performance of the Mamba architecture. Based on this analysis, we propose Masked Autoregressive Pretraining (MAP) to pretrain a hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network. This strategy combines the strengths of both MAE and Autoregressive pretraining, improving the performance of Mamba and Transformer modules within a unified paradigm. Additionally, in terms of integrating Mamba and Transformer modules, we empirically found that inserting Transformer layers at regular intervals within Mamba layers can significantly enhance downstream task performance. Experimental results show that both the pure Mamba architecture and the hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network pretrained with MAP significantly outperform other pretraining strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We validate the effectiveness of the method on both 2D and 3D datasets and provide detailed ablation studies to support the design choices for each component.</p>

When people compose music, they may infuse their understanding of music into their work, by using notes and intervals to craft melodies, chords to build progressions, and tempo to create a rhythmic feel. To what extent is this true of music generation models? More specifically, are fundamental Western music theory concepts observable within the "inner workings" of these models? Recent work proposed leveraging latent audio representations from music generation models towards music information retrieval tasks (e.g. genre classification, emotion recognition), which suggests that high-level musical characteristics are encoded within these models. However, probing individual music theory concepts (e.g. tempo, pitch class, chord quality) remains under-explored. Thus, we introduce SynTheory, a synthetic MIDI and audio music theory dataset, consisting of tempos, time signatures, notes, intervals, scales, chords, and chord progressions concepts. We then propose a framework to probe for these music theory concepts in music foundation models (Jukebox and MusicGen) and assess how strongly they encode these concepts within their internal representations. Our findings suggest that music theory concepts are discernible within foundation models and that the degree to which they are detectable varies by model size and layer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ti-Chung Cheng, Carmen Badea, Christian Bird, Thomas Zimmermann, Robert DeLine, Nicole Forsgren, Denae Ford</p>
<p>Abstract: Across domains, metrics and measurements are fundamental to identifying challenges, informing decisions, and resolving conflicts. Despite the abundance of data available in this information age, not only can it be challenging for a single expert to work across multi-disciplinary data, but non-experts can also find it unintuitive to create effective measures or transform theories into context-specific metrics that are chosen appropriately. This technical report addresses this challenge by examining software communities within large software corporations, where different measures are used as proxies to locate counterparts within the organization to transfer tacit knowledge. We propose a prompt-engineering framework inspired by neural activities, demonstrating that generative models can extract and summarize theories and perform basic reasoning, thereby transforming concepts into context-aware metrics to support software communities given software repository data. While this research zoomed in on software communities, we believe the framework's applicability extends across various fields, showcasing expert-theory-inspired metrics that aid in triaging complex challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baihan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of digital health and artificial intelligence, the management of patient data privacy has become increasingly complex, with significant implications for global health equity and patient trust. This paper introduces a novel "privacy gradient" approach to health data governance, offering a more nuanced and adaptive framework than traditional binary privacy models. Our multidimensional concept considers factors such as data sensitivity, stakeholder relationships, purpose of use, and temporal aspects, allowing for context-sensitive privacy protections. Through policy analyses, ethical considerations, and case studies spanning adolescent health, integrated care, and genomic research, we demonstrate how this approach can address critical privacy challenges in diverse healthcare settings worldwide. The privacy gradient model has the potential to enhance patient engagement, improve care coordination, and accelerate medical research while safeguarding individual privacy rights. We provide policy recommendations for implementing this approach, considering its impact on healthcare systems, research infrastructures, and global health initiatives. This work aims to inform policymakers, healthcare leaders, and digital health innovators, contributing to a more equitable, trustworthy, and effective global health data ecosystem in the digital age.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juliette Achddou (PSL, DI-ENS), Olivier Cappe (CNRS, DI-ENS, PSL), Aur\'elien Garivier (UMPA-ENSL, CNRS)</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by programmatic advertising optimization, we consider the task of sequentially allocating budget across a set of resources. At every time step, a feasible allocation is chosen and only a corresponding random return is observed. The goal is to maximize the cumulative expected sum of returns. This is a realistic model for budget allocation across subdivisions of marketing campaigns, with the objective of maximizing the number of conversions.  We study direct search (also known as pattern search) methods for linearly constrained and derivative-free optimization in the presence of noise, which apply in particular  to sequential budget allocation. These algorithms, which do not rely on hierarchical partitioning of the resource space, are easy to implement; they respect the operational constraints of resource allocation by avoiding evaluation outside of the feasible domain; and they are also compatible with warm start by being (approximate) descent algorithms. However, they have not yet been analyzed from the perspective of cumulative regret. We show that direct search methods achieves finite regret in the deterministic and unconstrained case. In the presence of evaluation noise and linear constraints, we propose a simple extension of direct search that achieves a regret upper-bound of the order of $T^{2/3}$. We also propose an accelerated version of the algorithm, relying on repeated sequential testing, that significantly improves the practical behavior of the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhe Zhang, He Bai, Ruixiang Zhang, Jiatao Gu, Shuangfei Zhai, Josh Susskind, Navdeep Jaitly</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated incredible strides on diverse vision language tasks. We dig into vision-based deductive reasoning, a more sophisticated but less explored realm, and find previously unexposed blindspots in the current SOTA VLMs. Specifically, we leverage Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs), to assess VLMs' abilities to perform multi-hop relational and deductive reasoning relying solely on visual clues. We perform comprehensive evaluations of several popular VLMs employing standard strategies such as in-context learning, self-consistency, and Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) on three diverse datasets, including the Mensa IQ test, IntelligenceTest, and RAVEN. The results reveal that despite the impressive capabilities of LLMs in text-based reasoning, we are still far from achieving comparable proficiency in visual deductive reasoning. We found that certain standard strategies that are effective when applied to LLMs do not seamlessly translate to the challenges presented by visual reasoning tasks. A detailed analysis reveals that VLMs struggle to solve these tasks mainly because they are unable to perceive and comprehend multiple, confounding abstract patterns in RPM examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jen-tse Huang, Eric John Li, Man Ho Lam, Tian Liang, Wenxuan Wang, Youliang Yuan, Wenxiang Jiao, Xing Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Michael R. Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making is a complex process requiring diverse abilities, making it an excellent framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Researchers have examined LLMs' decision-making through the lens of Game Theory. However, existing evaluation mainly focus on two-player scenarios where an LLM competes against another. Additionally, previous benchmarks suffer from test set leakage due to their static design. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, a new framework for evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. It includes eight classical game theory scenarios and a dynamic scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. $\gamma$-Bench allows flexible game settings and adapts the scoring system to different game parameters, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robustness, generalizability, and strategies for improvement. Our results indicate that GPT-3.5 demonstrates strong robustness but limited generalizability, which can be enhanced using methods like Chain-of-Thought. We also evaluate twelve LLMs from six model families, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms others, scoring of $68.1$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B ($64.5$) and Mixtral-8x22B ($61.4$).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Galkin, Jincheng Zhou, Bruno Ribeiro, Jian Tang, Zhaocheng Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex logical query answering (CLQA) in knowledge graphs (KGs) goes beyond simple KG completion and aims at answering compositional queries comprised of multiple projections and logical operations. Existing CLQA methods that learn parameters bound to certain entity or relation vocabularies can only be applied to the graph they are trained on which requires substantial training time before being deployed on a new graph. Here we present UltraQuery, the first foundation model for inductive reasoning that can zero-shot answer logical queries on any KG. The core idea of UltraQuery is to derive both projections and logical operations as vocabulary-independent functions which generalize to new entities and relations in any KG. With the projection operation initialized from a pre-trained inductive KG reasoning model, UltraQuery can solve CLQA on any KG after finetuning on a single dataset. Experimenting on 23 datasets, UltraQuery in the zero-shot inference mode shows competitive or better query answering performance than best available baselines and sets a new state of the art on 15 of them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fuki Ito, Toshio Suzuki</p>
<p>Abstract: Herein, we investigate the zero-error randomized complexity, which is the least cost against the worst input, of AND-OR tree computation by imposing various restrictions on the algorithm to find the Boolean value of the root of that tree and no restrictions on the tree shape. When a tree satisfies a certain condition regarding its symmetry, directional algorithms proposed by Saks and Wigderson (1986), special randomized algorithms, are known to achieve the randomized complexity. Furthermore, there is a known example of a tree that is so unbalanced that no directional algorithm achieves the randomized complexity (Vereshchagin 1998). In this study, we aim to identify where deviations arise between the general randomized Boolean decision tree and its special case, directional algorithms. In this paper, we show that for any AND-OR tree, randomized depth-first algorithms, which form a broader class compared with directional algorithms, have the same equilibrium as that of the directional algorithms. Thus, we get the collapse result on equilibria inequalities that holds for an arbitrary AND-OR tree. This implies that there exists a case where even depth-first algorithms cannot be the fastest, leading to the separation result on equilibria inequality. Additionally, a new algorithm is introduced as a key concept for proof of the separation result.</p>

<p>Abstract: Powerful foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), with Transformer architectures have ushered in a new era of Generative AI across various industries. Industry and research community have witnessed a large number of new applications, based on those foundation models. Such applications include question and answer, customer services, image and video generation, and code completions, among others. However, as the number of model parameters reaches to hundreds of billions, their deployment incurs prohibitive inference costs and high latency in real-world scenarios. As a result, the demand for cost-effective and fast inference using AI accelerators is ever more higher. To this end, our tutorial offers a comprehensive discussion on complementary inference optimization techniques using AI accelerators. Beginning with an overview of basic Transformer architectures and deep learning system frameworks, we deep dive into system optimization techniques for fast and memory-efficient attention computations and discuss how they can be implemented efficiently on AI accelerators. Next, we describe architectural elements that are key for fast transformer inference. Finally, we examine various model compression and fast decoding strategies in the same context.</p>

<p>Abstract: Since the invention of GPT2--1.5B in 2019, large language models (LLMs) have transitioned from specialized models to versatile foundation models. The LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot ability, however, require fine-tuning on local datasets and significant resources for deployment. Traditional fine-tuning techniques with the first-order optimizers require substantial GPU memory that exceeds mainstream hardware capability. Therefore, memory-efficient methods are motivated to be investigated. Model compression techniques can reduce energy consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact so that to support sustainable artificial intelligence advancements. Additionally, large-scale foundation models have expanded to create images, audio, videos, and multi-modal contents, further emphasizing the need for efficient deployment. Therefore, we are motivated to present a comprehensive overview of the prevalent memory-efficient fine-tuning methods over the network edge. We also review the state-of-the-art literatures on model compression to provide a vision on deploying LLMs over the network edge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Schnake, Farnoush Rezaei Jafari, Jonas Lederer, Ping Xiong, Shinichi Nakajima, Stefan Gugler, Gr\'egoire Montavon, Klaus-Robert M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in fostering transparency and trust in AI systems, where traditional XAI approaches typically offer one level of abstraction for explanations, often in the form of heatmaps highlighting single or multiple input features. However, we ask whether abstract reasoning or problem-solving strategies of a model may also be relevant, as these align more closely with how humans approach solutions to problems. We propose a framework, called Symbolic XAI, that attributes relevance to symbolic queries expressing logical relationships between input features, thereby capturing the abstract reasoning behind a model's predictions. The methodology is built upon a simple yet general multi-order decomposition of model predictions. This decomposition can be specified using higher-order propagation-based relevance methods, such as GNN-LRP, or perturbation-based explanation methods commonly used in XAI. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated in the domains of natural language processing (NLP), vision, and quantum chemistry (QC), where abstract symbolic domain knowledge is abundant and of significant interest to users. The Symbolic XAI framework provides an understanding of the model's decision-making process that is both flexible for customization by the user and human-readable through logical formulas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Burden, Manuel Cebrian, Jose Hernandez-Orallo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a dual-use dilemma: they enable beneficial applications while harboring potential for harm, particularly through conversational interactions. Despite various safeguards, advanced LLMs remain vulnerable. A watershed case was Kevin Roose's notable conversation with Bing, which elicited harmful outputs after extended interaction. This contrasts with simpler early jailbreaks that produced similar content more easily, raising the question: How much conversational effort is needed to elicit harmful information from LLMs? We propose two measures: Conversational Length (CL), which quantifies the conversation length used to obtain a specific response, and Conversational Complexity (CC), defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of the user's instruction sequence leading to the response. To address the incomputability of Kolmogorov complexity, we approximate CC using a reference LLM to estimate the compressibility of user instructions. Applying this approach to a large red-teaming dataset, we perform a quantitative analysis examining the statistical distribution of harmful and harmless conversational lengths and complexities. Our empirical findings suggest that this distributional analysis and the minimisation of CC serve as valuable tools for understanding AI safety, offering insights into the accessibility of harmful information. This work establishes a foundation for a new perspective on LLM safety, centered around the algorithmic complexity of pathways to harm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianlong Wang, Junzhe Chen, Xueting Han, Jing Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-training, particularly reinforcement learning (RL) using self-play-generated data, has become a new learning paradigm for large language models (LLMs). However, scaling RL to develop a general reasoner remains a research challenge, as existing methods focus on task-specific reasoning without adequately addressing generalization across a broader range of tasks. Moreover, unlike traditional RL with limited action space, LLMs operate in an infinite space, making it crucial to search for valuable and diverse strategies to solve problems effectively. To address this, we propose searching within the action space on high-level abstract plans to enhance model generalization and introduce Critical Plan Step Learning (CPL), comprising: 1) searching on plan, using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore diverse plan steps in multi-step reasoning tasks, and 2) learning critical plan steps through Step-level Advantage Preference Optimization (Step-APO), which integrates advantage estimates for step preference obtained via MCTS into Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This combination helps the model effectively learn critical plan steps, enhancing both reasoning capabilities and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on GSM8K and MATH, not only significantly improves performance on GSM8K (+10.5%) and MATH (+6.5%), but also enhances out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks, such as HumanEval (+12.2%), GPQA (+8.6%), ARC-C (+4.0%), MMLU-STEM (+2.2%), and BBH (+1.8%).</p>

<p>Abstract: A pandemic is the spread of a disease across large regions, and can have devastating costs to the society in terms of health, economic and social. As such, the study of effective pandemic mitigation strategies can yield significant positive impact on the society. A pandemic can be mathematically described using a compartmental model, such as the Susceptible Infected Removed (SIR) model. In this paper, we extend the solution equations of the SIR model to a state transition model with lockdowns. We formalize a metric hybrid planning problem based on this state transition model, and solve it using a metric hybrid planner. We improve the runtime effectiveness of the metric hybrid planner with the addition of valid inequalities, and demonstrate the success of our approach both theoretically and experimentally under various challenging settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lucas Robinet, Ahmad Berjaoui, Ziad Kheil, Elizabeth Cohen-Jonathan Moyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-life medical data is often multimodal and incomplete, fueling the growing need for advanced deep learning models capable of integrating them efficiently. The use of diverse modalities, including histopathology slides, MRI, and genetic data, offers unprecedented opportunities to improve prognosis prediction and to unveil new treatment pathways. Contrastive learning, widely used for deriving representations from paired data in multimodal tasks, assumes that different views contain the same task-relevant information and leverages only shared information. This assumption becomes restrictive when handling medical data since each modality also harbors specific knowledge relevant to downstream tasks. We introduce DRIM, a new multimodal method for capturing these shared and unique representations, despite data sparsity. More specifically, given a set of modalities, we aim to encode a representation for each one that can be divided into two components: one encapsulating patient-related information common across modalities and the other, encapsulating modality-specific details. This is achieved by increasing the shared information among different patient modalities while minimizing the overlap between shared and unique components within each modality. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on glioma patients survival prediction tasks, while being robust to missing modalities. To promote reproducibility, the code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/DRIM</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic clustering properties of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for video games, enriching our understanding of the internal dynamics of DRL and advancing its interpretability. In this context, semantic clustering refers to the inherent capacity of neural networks to internally group video inputs based on semantic similarity. To achieve this, we propose a novel DRL architecture that integrates a semantic clustering module featuring both feature dimensionality reduction and online clustering. This module seamlessly integrates into the DRL training pipeline, addressing instability issues observed in previous t-SNE-based analysis methods and eliminating the necessity for extensive manual annotation of semantic analysis. Through experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed module and the semantic clustering properties in DRL for video games. Additionally, based on these properties, we introduce new analytical methods to help understand the hierarchical structure of policies and the semantic distribution within the feature space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in planning remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluate the planning capabilities of OpenAI's o1 models across a variety of benchmark tasks, focusing on three key aspects: feasibility, optimality, and generalizability. Through empirical evaluations on constraint-heavy tasks (e.g., $\textit{Barman}$, $\textit{Tyreworld}$) and spatially complex environments (e.g., $\textit{Termes}$, $\textit{Floortile}$), we highlight o1-preview's strengths in self-evaluation and constraint-following, while also identifying bottlenecks in decision-making and memory management, particularly in tasks requiring robust spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that o1-preview outperforms GPT-4 in adhering to task constraints and managing state transitions in structured environments. However, the model often generates suboptimal solutions with redundant actions and struggles to generalize effectively in spatially complex tasks. This pilot study provides foundational insights into the planning limitations of LLMs, offering key directions for future research on improving memory management, decision-making, and generalization in LLM-based planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Wang, Rodney Beard, John Hawkins, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: The gross domestic product (GDP) is the most widely used indicator in macroeconomics and the main tool for measuring a country's economic output. Due to the diversity and complexity of the world economy, a wide range of models have been used, but there are challenges in making decadal GDP forecasts given unexpected changes such as emergence of catastrophic world events including pandemics and wars. Deep learning models are well suited for modelling temporal sequences and time series forecasting. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to forecast the GDP growth rate of the world economy over a decade. We use the Penn World Table as the data source featuring 13 countries prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Australia, China, India, and the United States. We present a recursive deep learning framework to predict the GDP growth rate in the next ten years. We test prominent deep learning models and compare their results with traditional econometric models for selected developed and developing countries. Our decadal forecasts reveal that that most of the developed countries would experience economic growth slowdown, stagnation and even recession within five years (2020-2024). Furthermore, our model forecasts show that only China, France, and India would experience stable GDP growth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Density-based clustering could be the most popular clustering algorithm since it can identify clusters of arbitrary shape as long as they are separated by low-density regions. However, a high-density region that is not separated by low-density ones might also have different structures belonging to multiple clusters. As far as we know, all previous density-based clustering algorithms fail to detect such structures. In this paper, we provide a novel density-based clustering scheme that can not only detect clusters separated by low-density regions but also detect structures in high-density regions not separated by low-density ones. The algorithm employs secondary directed differential, hierarchy, normalized density, as well as the self-adaption coefficient, and thus is called Structure Detecting Cluster by Hierarchical Secondary Directed Differential with Normalized Density and Self-Adaption, dubbed by SDC-HSDD-NDSA. The algorithm is run on several datasets to verify its effectiveness, robustness, as well as granularity independence, and results demonstrate that it has the ability that previous ones do not have.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edmund Lau, Zach Furman, George Wang, Daniel Murfet, Susan Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: The Local Learning Coefficient (LLC) is introduced as a novel complexity measure for deep neural networks (DNNs). Recognizing the limitations of traditional complexity measures, the LLC leverages Singular Learning Theory (SLT), which has long recognized the significance of singularities in the loss landscape geometry. This paper provides an extensive exploration of the LLC's theoretical underpinnings, offering both a clear definition and intuitive insights into its application. Moreover, we propose a new scalable estimator for the LLC, which is then effectively applied across diverse architectures including deep linear networks up to 100M parameters, ResNet image models, and transformer language models. Empirical evidence suggests that the LLC provides valuable insights into how training heuristics might influence the effective complexity of DNNs. Ultimately, the LLC emerges as a crucial tool for reconciling the apparent contradiction between deep learning's complexity and the principle of parsimony.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Zidane, Ghada Soliman</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes an approach of Ladder Bottom-up Convolutional Bidirectional Variational Autoencoder (LCBVAE) architecture for the encoder and decoder, which is trained on the image translation of the dotted Arabic expiration dates by reconstructing the Arabic dotted expiration dates into filled-in expiration dates. We employed a customized and adapted version of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network CRNN model to meet our specific requirements and enhance its performance in our context, and then trained the custom CRNN model with the filled-in images from the year of 2019 to 2027 to extract the expiration dates and assess the model performance of LCBVAE on the expiration date recognition. The pipeline of (LCBVAE+CRNN) can be then integrated into an automated sorting systems for extracting the expiry dates and sorting the products accordingly during the manufacture stage. Additionally, it can overcome the manual entry of expiration dates that can be time-consuming and inefficient at the merchants. Due to the lack of the availability of the dotted Arabic expiration date images, we created an Arabic dot-matrix True Type Font (TTF) for the generation of the synthetic images. We trained the model with unrealistic synthetic dates of 60,000 images and performed the testing on a realistic synthetic date of 3000 images from the year of 2019 to 2027, represented as yyyy/mm/dd. In our study, we demonstrated the significance of latent bottleneck layer with improving the generalization when the size is increased up to 1024 in downstream transfer learning tasks as for image translation. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 97% on the image translation with using the LCBVAE architecture that can be generalized for any downstream learning tasks as for image translation and reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Scimeca, Alexander Rubinstein, Damien Teney, Seong Joon Oh, Armand Mihai Nicolicioiu, Yoshua Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: Spurious correlations in the data, where multiple cues are predictive of the target labels, often lead to a phenomenon known as shortcut learning, where a model relies on erroneous, easy-to-learn cues while ignoring reliable ones. In this work, we propose DiffDiv an ensemble diversification framework exploiting Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) to mitigate this form of bias. We show that at particular training intervals, DPMs can generate images with novel feature combinations, even when trained on samples displaying correlated input features. We leverage this crucial property to generate synthetic counterfactuals to increase model diversity via ensemble disagreement. We show that DPM-guided diversification is sufficient to remove dependence on shortcut cues, without a need for additional supervised signals. We further empirically quantify its efficacy on several diversification objectives, and finally show improved generalization and diversification on par with prior work that relies on auxiliary data collection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Paul Cohen, Louis Blankemeier, Akshay Chaudhari</p>
<p>Abstract: Models driven by spurious correlations often yield poor generalization performance. We propose the counterfactual (CF) alignment method to detect and quantify spurious correlations of black box classifiers. Our methodology is based on counterfactual images generated with respect to one classifier being input into other classifiers to see if they also induce changes in the outputs of these classifiers. The relationship between these responses can be quantified and used to identify specific instances where a spurious correlation exists. This is validated by observing intuitive trends in a face-attribute face-attribute and waterbird classifiers, as well as by fabricating spurious correlations and detecting their presence, both visually and quantitatively. Furthermore, utilizing the CF alignment method, we demonstrate that we can evaluate robust optimization methods (GroupDRO, JTT, and FLAC) by detecting a reduction in spurious correlations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Building general-purpose robots that operate seamlessly in any environment, with any object, and utilizing various skills to complete diverse tasks has been a long-standing goal in Artificial Intelligence. However, as a community, we have been constraining most robotic systems by designing them for specific tasks, training them on specific datasets, and deploying them within specific environments. These systems require extensively-labeled data and task-specific models. When deployed in real-world scenarios, such systems face several generalization issues and struggle to remain robust to distribution shifts. Motivated by the impressive open-set performance and content generation capabilities of web-scale, large-capacity pre-trained models (i.e., foundation models) in research fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), we devote this survey to exploring (i) how these existing foundation models from NLP and CV can be applied to the field of general-purpose robotics, and also exploring (ii) what a robotics-specific foundation model would look like. We begin by providing a generalized formulation of how foundation models are used in robotics, and the fundamental barriers to making generalist robots universally applicable. Next, we establish a taxonomy to discuss current work exploring ways to leverage existing foundation models for robotics and develop ones catered to robotics. Finally, we discuss key challenges and promising future directions in using foundation models for enabling general-purpose robotic systems. We encourage readers to view our living GitHub repository 2 of resources, including papers reviewed in this survey, as well as related projects and repositories for developing foundation models for robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Johann Wetzel</p>
<p>Abstract: I introduce a unified framework for finding a closed-form interpretation of any single neuron in an artificial neural network. Using this framework I demonstrate how to interpret neural network classifiers to reveal closed-form expressions of the concepts encoded in their decision boundaries. In contrast to neural network-based regression, for classification, it is in general impossible to express the neural network in the form of a symbolic equation even if the neural network itself bases its classification on a quantity that can be written as a closed-form equation. The interpretation framework is based on embedding trained neural networks into an equivalence class of functions that encode the same concept. I interpret these neural networks by finding an intersection between the equivalence class and human-readable equations defined by a symbolic search space. The approach is not limited to classifiers or full neural networks and can be applied to arbitrary neurons in hidden layers or latent spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Meihuizi Jia, Luu Anh Tuan, Fengjun Pan, Jinming Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning, a paradigm bridging the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, has demonstrated high efficacy in several NLP tasks, especially in few-shot settings. Despite being widely applied, in-context learning is vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this work, we raise security concerns regarding this paradigm. Our studies demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the behavior of large language models by poisoning the demonstration context, without the need for fine-tuning the model. Specifically, we design a new backdoor attack method, named ICLAttack, to target large language models based on in-context learning. Our method encompasses two types of attacks: poisoning demonstration examples and poisoning demonstration prompts, which can make models behave in alignment with predefined intentions. ICLAttack does not require additional fine-tuning to implant a backdoor, thus preserving the model's generality. Furthermore, the poisoned examples are correctly labeled, enhancing the natural stealth of our attack method. Extensive experimental results across several language models, ranging in size from 1.3B to 180B parameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method, exemplified by a high average attack success rate of 95.0% across the three datasets on OPT models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zerui Wang, Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The opacity of AI models necessitates both validation and evaluation before their integration into services. To investigate these models, explainable AI (XAI) employs methods that elucidate the relationship between input features and output predictions. The operations of XAI extend beyond the execution of a single algorithm, involving a series of activities that include preprocessing data, adjusting XAI to align with model parameters, invoking the model to generate predictions, and summarizing the XAI results. Adversarial attacks are well-known threats that aim to mislead AI models. The assessment complexity, especially for XAI, increases when open-source AI models are subject to adversarial attacks, due to various combinations. To automate the numerous entities and tasks involved in XAI-based assessments, we propose a cloud-based service framework that encapsulates computing components as microservices and organizes assessment tasks into pipelines. The current XAI tools are not inherently service-oriented. This framework also integrates open XAI tool libraries as part of the pipeline composition. We demonstrate the application of XAI services for assessing five quality attributes of AI models: (1) computational cost, (2) performance, (3) robustness, (4) explanation deviation, and (5) explanation resilience across computer vision and tabular cases. The service framework generates aggregated analysis that showcases the quality attributes for more than a hundred combination scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohaifa Khaldi, Siham Tabik, Sergio Puertas-Ruiz, Julio Pe\~nas de Giles, Jos\'e Antonio H\'odar Correa, Regino Zamora, Domingo Alcaraz Segura</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring the distribution and size of long-living large shrubs, such as junipers, is crucial for assessing the long-term impacts of global change on high-mountain ecosystems. While deep learning models have shown remarkable success in object segmentation, adapting these models to detect shrub species with polymorphic nature remains challenging. In this research, we release a large dataset of individual shrub delineations on freely available satellite imagery and use an instance segmentation model to map all junipers over the treeline for an entire biosphere reserve (Sierra Nevada, Spain). To optimize performance, we introduced a novel dual data construction approach: using photo-interpreted (PI) data for model development and fieldwork (FW) data for validation. To account for the polymorphic nature of junipers during model evaluation, we developed a soft version of the Intersection over Union metric. Finally, we assessed the uncertainty of the resulting map in terms of canopy cover and density of shrubs per size class. Our model achieved an F1-score in shrub delineation of 87.87% on the PI data and 76.86% on the FW data. The R2 and RMSE of the observed versus predicted relationship were 0.63 and 6.67% for canopy cover, and 0.90 and 20.62 for shrub density. The greater density of larger shrubs in lower altitudes and smaller shrubs in higher altitudes observed in the model outputs was also present in the PI and FW data, suggesting an altitudinal uplift in the optimal performance of the species. This study demonstrates that deep learning applied on freely available high-resolution satellite imagery is useful to detect medium to large shrubs of high ecological value at the regional scale, which could be expanded to other high-mountains worldwide and to historical and forthcoming imagery.</p>

We analyze a family of decision rules that sample adaptively to minimize uncertainty about prediction targets. We are the first to show, under general regularity assumptions, that such decision rules converge uniformly to the smallest possible uncertainty obtainable from the accessible data. We demonstrate their strong sample efficiency in two key applications: Active few-shot fine-tuning of large neural networks and safe Bayesian optimization, where they improve significantly upon the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Today's video-conferencing tools support a rich range of professional and social activities, but their generic meeting environments cannot be dynamically adapted to align with distributed collaborators' needs. To enable end-user customization, we developed BlendScape, a rendering and composition system for video-conferencing participants to tailor environments to their meeting context by leveraging AI image generation techniques. BlendScape supports flexible representations of task spaces by blending users' physical or digital backgrounds into unified environments and implements multimodal interaction techniques to steer the generation. Through an exploratory study with 15 end-users, we investigated whether and how they would find value in using generative AI to customize video-conferencing environments. Participants envisioned using a system like BlendScape to facilitate collaborative activities in the future, but required further controls to mitigate distracting or unrealistic visual elements. We implemented scenarios to demonstrate BlendScape's expressiveness for supporting environment design strategies from prior work and propose composition techniques to improve the quality of environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bora Yongacoglu, G\"urdal Arslan, Lacra Pavel, Serdar Y\"uksel</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game theory, agents repeatedly interact and revise their strategies as new data arrives, producing a sequence of strategy profiles. This paper studies sequences of strategies satisfying a pairwise constraint inspired by policy updating in reinforcement learning, where an agent who is best responding in one period does not switch its strategy in the next period. This constraint merely requires that optimizing agents do not switch strategies, but does not constrain the non-optimizing agents in any way, and thus allows for exploration. Sequences with this property are called satisficing paths, and arise naturally in many MARL algorithms. A fundamental question about strategic dynamics is such: for a given game and initial strategy profile, is it always possible to construct a satisficing path that terminates at an equilibrium? The resolution of this question has implications about the capabilities or limitations of a class of MARL algorithms. We answer this question in the affirmative for normal-form games. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that reward deteriorating strategic updates are key to driving play to equilibrium along a satisficing path.</p>

<p>Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose}$: Automatic quantification of longitudinal changes in PET scans for lymphoma patients has proven challenging, as residual disease in interim-therapy scans is often subtle and difficult to detect. Our goal was to develop a longitudinally-aware segmentation network (LAS-Net) that can quantify serial PET/CT images for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients. $\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: This retrospective study included baseline (PET1) and interim (PET2) PET/CT images from 297 patients enrolled in two Children's Oncology Group clinical trials (AHOD1331 and AHOD0831). LAS-Net incorporates longitudinal cross-attention, allowing relevant features from PET1 to inform the analysis of PET2. Model performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients for PET1 and detection F1 scores for PET2. Additionally, we extracted and compared quantitative PET metrics, including metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in PET1, as well as qPET and $\Delta$SUVmax in PET2, against physician measurements. We quantified their agreement using Spearman's $\rho$ correlations and employed bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis. $\textbf{Results}$: LAS-Net detected residual lymphoma in PET2 with an F1 score of 0.606 (precision/recall: 0.615/0.600), outperforming all comparator methods (P<0.01). For baseline segmentation, LAS-Net achieved a mean Dice score of 0.772. In PET quantification, LAS-Net's measurements of qPET, $\Delta$SUVmax, MTV and TLG were strongly correlated with physician measurements, with Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.78, 0.80, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. The performance remained high, with a slight decrease, in an external testing cohort. $\textbf{Conclusion}$: LAS-Net demonstrated significant improvements in quantifying PET metrics across serial scans, highlighting the value of longitudinal awareness in evaluating multi-time-point imaging datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyan Tang, Philippe Laban, Greg Durrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing if LLM output can be grounded in evidence is central to many tasks in NLP: retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, document-grounded dialogue, and more. Current approaches to this kind of fact-checking are based on verifying each piece of a model generation against potential evidence using an LLM. However, this process can be very computationally expensive, requiring many calls to a model to check a single response. In this work, we show how to build small fact-checking models that have GPT-4-level performance but for 400x lower cost. We do this by constructing synthetic training data with GPT-4, which involves creating realistic yet challenging instances of factual errors via a structured generation procedure. Training on this data teaches models to check each fact in the claim and recognize synthesis of information across sentences. For evaluation, we unify datasets from recent work on fact-checking and grounding LLM generations into a new benchmark, LLM-AggreFact. Our best system MiniCheck-FT5 (770M parameters) outperforms all systems of comparable size and reaches GPT-4 accuracy. We release LLM-AggreFact, code for data synthesis, and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zezheng Song, Jiaxin Yuan, Haizhao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The fast simulation of dynamical systems is a key challenge in many scientific and engineering applications, such as weather forecasting, disease control, and drug discovery. With the recent success of deep learning, there is increasing interest in using neural networks to solve differential equations in a data-driven manner. However, existing methods are either limited to specific types of differential equations or require large amounts of data for training. This restricts their practicality in many real-world applications, where data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal foundation model, named \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), to bridge the gap between human-designed and data-driven models for the fast simulation of dynamical systems. Built on a decoder-only transformer architecture with in-context learning, FMint utilizes both numerical and textual data to learn a universal error correction scheme for dynamical systems, using prompted sequences of coarse solutions from traditional solvers. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 40K ODEs, and we perform extensive experiments on challenging ODEs that exhibit chaotic behavior and of high dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared to classical numerical solvers, highlighting FMint's potential as a general-purpose solver for dynamical systems. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms. The code for FMint is available at \url{https://github.com/margotyjx/FMint}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anshuman Chhabra, Bo Li, Jian Chen, Prasant Mohapatra, Hongfu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: A core data-centric learning challenge is the identification of training samples that are detrimental to model performance. Influence functions serve as a prominent tool for this task and offer a robust framework for assessing training data influence on model predictions. Despite their widespread use, their high computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large-sized deep models. In this paper, we establish a bridge between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the hypothesis of our proposed outlier gradient analysis approach on synthetic datasets. We then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models and selecting data samples for improving performance of natural language processing transformer models. We also extend its use to influential sample identification for fine-tuning Large Language Models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce "Future You," an interactive, brief, single-session, digital chat intervention designed to improve future self-continuity--the degree of connection an individual feels with a temporally distant future self--a characteristic that is positively related to mental health and wellbeing. Our system allows users to chat with a relatable yet AI-powered virtual version of their future selves that is tuned to their future goals and personal qualities. To make the conversation realistic, the system generates a "synthetic memory"--a unique backstory for each user--that creates a throughline between the user's present age (between 18-30) and their life at age 60. The "Future You" character also adopts the persona of an age-progressed image of the user's present self. After a brief interaction with the "Future You" character, users reported decreased anxiety, and increased future self-continuity. This is the first study successfully demonstrating the use of personalized AI-generated characters to improve users' future self-continuity and wellbeing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minbyul Jeong, Hyeon Hwang, Chanwoong Yoon, Taewhoo Lee, Jaewoo Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the medical domain, numerous scenarios necessitate the long-form generation ability of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, when addressing patients' questions, it is essential that the model's response conveys factual claims, highlighting the need for an automated method to evaluate those claims. Thus, we introduce MedLFQA, a benchmark dataset reconstructed using long-form question-answering datasets related to the biomedical domain. We use MedLFQA to facilitate a cost-effective automatic evaluations of factuality. We also propose OLAPH, a simple and novel framework that utilizes cost-effective and multifaceted automatic evaluation to construct a synthetic preference set and answers questions in our preferred manner. Our framework leads us to train LLMs step-by-step to reduce hallucinations and include crucial medical claims. We highlight that, even on evaluation metrics not used during training, LLMs trained with our OLAPH framework demonstrate significant performance improvement in factuality. Our findings reveal that a 7B LLM trained with our OLAPH framework can provide long answers comparable to the medical experts' answers in terms of factuality. We believe that our work could shed light on gauging the long-text generation ability of LLMs in the medical domain. Our code and datasets are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Morehead, Nabin Giri, Jian Liu, Jianlin Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of docking methods within the broadly applicable context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for applicability to unknown structures); (2) docking multiple ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for unknown pocket generalization). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for broadly applicable protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL docking methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure generation using both single and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that (1) DL methods consistently outperform conventional docking algorithms; (2) most recent DL docking methods fail to generalize to multi-ligand protein targets; and (3) training DL methods with physics-informed loss functions on diverse clusters of protein-ligand complexes is a promising direction for future work. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manh Khoi Duong, Stefan Conrad</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the recital (67) of the current corrigendum of the AI Act in the European Union, we propose and present measures and mitigation strategies for discrimination in tabular datasets. We specifically focus on datasets that contain multiple protected attributes, such as nationality, age, and sex. This makes measuring and mitigating bias more challenging, as many existing methods are designed for a single protected attribute. This paper comes with a twofold contribution: Firstly, new discrimination measures are introduced. These measures are categorized in our framework along with existing ones, guiding researchers and practitioners in choosing the right measure to assess the fairness of the underlying dataset. Secondly, a novel application of an existing bias mitigation method, FairDo, is presented. We show that this strategy can mitigate any type of discrimination, including intersectional discrimination, by transforming the dataset. By conducting experiments on real-world datasets (Adult, Bank, COMPAS), we demonstrate that de-biasing datasets with multiple protected attributes is possible. All transformed datasets show a reduction in discrimination, on average by 28%. Further, these datasets do not compromise any of the tested machine learning models' performances significantly compared to the original datasets. Conclusively, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy used and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the implementation of the European Union's AI Act.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raja Marjieh, Sreejan Kumar, Declan Campbell, Liyi Zhang, Gianluca Bencomo, Jake Snell, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans rely on strong inductive biases to learn from few examples and abstract useful information from sensory data. Instilling such biases in machine learning models has been shown to improve their performance on various benchmarks including few-shot learning, robustness, and alignment. However, finding effective training procedures to achieve that goal can be challenging as psychologically-rich training data such as human similarity judgments are expensive to scale, and Bayesian models of human inductive biases are often intractable for complex, realistic domains. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a Bayesian notion of generative similarity whereby two datapoints are considered similar if they are likely to have been sampled from the same distribution. This measure can be applied to complex generative processes, including probabilistic programs. We show that generative similarity can be used to define a contrastive learning objective even when its exact form is intractable, enabling learning of spatial embeddings that express specific inductive biases. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by showing that it can be used to capture human inductive biases for geometric shapes, distinguish different abstract drawing styles that are parameterized by probabilistic programs, and capture abstract high-level categories that enable generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dixuan Lin, Yuxiang Zhang, Mengcheng Li, Yebin Liu, Wei Jing, Qi Yan, Qianying Wang, Hongwen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OmniHands, a universal approach to recovering interactive hand meshes and their relative movement from monocular or multi-view inputs. Our approach addresses two major limitations of previous methods: lacking a unified solution for handling various hand image inputs and neglecting the positional relationship of two hands within images. To overcome these challenges, we develop a universal architecture with novel tokenization and contextual feature fusion strategies, capable of adapting to a variety of tasks. Specifically, we propose a Relation-aware Two-Hand Tokenization (RAT) method to embed positional relation information into the hand tokens. In this way, our network can handle both single-hand and two-hand inputs and explicitly leverage relative hand positions, facilitating the reconstruction of intricate hand interactions in real-world scenarios. As such tokenization indicates the relative relationship of two hands, it also supports more effective feature fusion. To this end, we further develop a 4D Interaction Reasoning (FIR) module to fuse hand tokens in 4D with attention and decode them into 3D hand meshes and relative temporal movements. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmark datasets. The results on in-the-wild videos and real-world scenarios demonstrate the superior performances of our approach for interactive hand reconstruction.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Deep Learning enhances decision-making by integrating diverse information sources, such as texts, images, audio, and videos. To develop trustworthy multimodal approaches, it is essential to understand how uncertainty impacts these models. We propose LUMA, a unique benchmark dataset, featuring audio, image, and textual data from 50 classes, for learning from uncertain and multimodal data. It extends the well-known CIFAR 10/100 dataset with audio samples extracted from three audio corpora, and text data generated using the Gemma-7B Large Language Model (LLM). The LUMA dataset enables the controlled injection of varying types and degrees of uncertainty to achieve and tailor specific experiments and benchmarking initiatives. LUMA is also available as a Python package including the functions for generating multiple variants of the dataset with controlling the diversity of the data, the amount of noise for each modality, and adding out-of-distribution samples. A baseline pre-trained model is also provided alongside three uncertainty quantification methods: Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, and Reliable Conflictive Multi-View Learning. This comprehensive dataset and its benchmarking tools are intended to promote and support the development, evaluation, and benchmarking of trustworthy and robust multimodal deep learning approaches. We anticipate that the LUMA dataset will help the ICLR community to design more trustworthy and robust machine learning approaches for safety critical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to co-extract the sentiment triplets in a given corpus. Existing approaches within the pretraining-finetuning paradigm tend to either meticulously craft complex tagging schemes and classification heads, or incorporate external semantic augmentation to enhance performance. In this study, we, for the first time, re-evaluate the redundancy in tagging schemes and the internal enhancement in pretrained representations. We propose a method to improve and utilize pretrained representations by integrating a minimalist tagging scheme and a novel token-level contrastive learning strategy. The proposed approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques while featuring a more compact design and reduced computational overhead. Additionally, we are the first to formally evaluate GPT-4's performance in few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought scenarios for this task. The results demonstrate that the pretraining-finetuning paradigm remains highly effective even in the era of large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songming Zhang, Xue Zhang, Zengkui Sun, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is known as a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) via transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the two models so that more knowledge can be transferred. However, in the current white-box KD framework, the output distributions are from the respective output spaces of the two models, using their own prediction heads. We argue that the space discrepancy will lead to low similarity between the teacher model and the student model on both representation and distribution levels. Furthermore, this discrepancy also hinders the KD process between models with different vocabularies, which is common for current LLMs. To address these issues, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the output spaces of the two models for KD. On the basis of DSKD, we further develop a cross-model attention mechanism, which can automatically align the representations of the two models with different vocabularies. Thus, our framework is not only compatible with various distance functions for KD (e.g., KL divergence) like the current framework, but also supports KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Experiments on task-agnostic instruction-following benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms the current white-box KD framework with various distance functions, and also surpasses existing KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dibyajyoti Chakraborty, Seung Whan Chung, Troy Arcomano, Romit Maulik</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge in various fields, such as geosciences and engineering. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), which combine the power of neural networks and numerical solvers, have emerged as a promising algorithm for forecasting complex nonlinear dynamical systems. However, classical techniques used for NODE training are ineffective for learning chaotic dynamical systems. In this work, we propose a novel NODE-training approach that allows for robust learning of chaotic dynamical systems. Our method addresses the challenges of non-convexity and exploding gradients associated with underlying chaotic dynamics. Training data trajectories from such systems are split into multiple, non-overlapping time windows. In addition to the deviation from the training data, the optimization loss term further penalizes the discontinuities of the predicted trajectory between the time windows. The window size is selected based on the fastest Lyapunov time scale of the system. Multi-step penalty(MP) method is first demonstrated on Lorenz equation, to illustrate how it improves the loss landscape and thereby accelerates the optimization convergence. MP method can optimize chaotic systems in a manner similar to least-squares shadowing with significantly lower computational costs. Our proposed algorithm, denoted the Multistep Penalty NODE, is applied to chaotic systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and ERA5 reanalysis data for the atmosphere. It is observed that MP-NODE provide viable performance for such chaotic systems, not only for short-term trajectory predictions but also for invariant statistics that are hallmarks of the chaotic nature of these dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin C. Geyer, Alessandro Torcinovich, Jo\~ao B. Carvalho, Alexander Meyer, Joachim M. Buhmann</p>
<p>Abstract: In unsupervised representation learning, models aim to distill essential features from high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional learned representations, guided by inductive biases. Understanding the characteristics that make a good representation remains a topic of ongoing research. Disentanglement of independent generative processes has long been credited with producing high-quality representations. However, focusing solely on representations that adhere to the stringent requirements of most disentanglement metrics, may result in overlooking many high-quality representations, well suited for various downstream tasks. These metrics often demand that generative factors be encoded in distinct, single dimensions aligned with the canonical basis of the representation space.
  Motivated by these observations, we propose two novel metrics: Importance-Weighted Orthogonality (IWO) and Importance-Weighted Rank (IWR). These metrics evaluate the mutual orthogonality and rank of generative factor subspaces. Throughout extensive experiments on common downstream tasks, over several benchmark datasets and models, IWO and IWR consistently show stronger correlations with downstream task performance than traditional disentanglement metrics. Our findings suggest that representation quality is closer related to the orthogonality of independent generative processes rather than their disentanglement, offering a new direction for evaluating and improving unsupervised learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Wei, Peiyan Hu, Ruiqi Feng, Haodong Feng, Yixuan Du, Tao Zhang, Rui Wang, Yue Wang, Zhi-Ming Ma, Tailin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and plan near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method on three tasks: 1D Burgers' equation, 2D jellyfish movement control, and 2D high-dimensional smoke control, where our generated jellyfish dataset is released as a benchmark for complex physical system control research. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqing Yang, Yan Ma, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) exceed human-level capabilities, it becomes increasingly challenging to provide full-scale and accurate supervision for these models. Weak-to-strong learning, which leverages a less capable model to unlock the latent abilities of a stronger model, proves valuable in this context. Yet, the efficacy of this approach for complex reasoning tasks is still untested. Furthermore, tackling reasoning tasks under the weak-to-strong setting currently lacks efficient methods to avoid blindly imitating the weak supervisor including its errors. In this paper, we introduce a progressive learning framework that enables the strong model to autonomously refine its training data, without requiring input from either a more advanced model or human-annotated data. This framework begins with supervised fine-tuning on a selective small but high-quality dataset, followed by preference optimization on contrastive samples identified by the strong model itself. Extensive experiments on the GSM8K and MATH datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of Llama2-70b using three separate weak models. This method is further validated in a forward-looking experimental setup, where Llama3-8b-instruct effectively supervises Llama3-70b on the highly challenging OlympicArena dataset. This work paves the way for a more scalable and sophisticated strategy to enhance AI reasoning powers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> T. Ben Thompson (Confirm Labs), Michael Sklar (Confirm Labs)</p>
<p>Abstract: Many publicly available language models have been safety tuned to reduce the likelihood of toxic or liability-inducing text. To redteam or jailbreak these models for compliance with toxic requests, users and security analysts have developed adversarial prompting techniques. One attack method is to apply discrete optimization techniques to the prompt. However, the resulting attack strings are often gibberish text, easily filtered by defenders due to high measured perplexity, and may fail for unseen tasks and/or well-tuned models. In this work, we improve existing algorithms (primarily GCG and BEAST) to develop powerful and fluent attacks on safety-tuned models like Llama-2 and Phi-3. Our technique centers around a new distillation-based approach that encourages the victim model to emulate a toxified finetune, either in terms of output probabilities or internal activations. To encourage human-fluent attacks, we add a multi-model perplexity penalty and a repetition penalty to the objective. We also enhance optimizer strength by allowing token insertions, token swaps, and token deletions and by using longer attack sequences. The resulting process is able to reliably jailbreak the most difficult target models with prompts that appear similar to human-written prompts. On Advbench we achieve attack success rates $>93$% for Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Vicuna-7B, while maintaining model-measured perplexity $<33$; we achieve $95$% attack success for Phi-3, though with higher perplexity. We also find a universally-optimized single fluent prompt that induces $>88$% compliance on previously unseen tasks across Llama-2-7B, Phi-3-mini and Vicuna-7B and transfers to other black-box models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transparency in AI decision-making is crucial in healthcare due to the severe consequences of errors, and this is important for building trust among AI and users in sentiment analysis task. Incorporating reasoning capabilities helps Large Language Models (LLMs) understand human emotions within broader contexts, handle nuanced and ambiguous language, and infer underlying sentiments that may not be explicitly stated. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Our study showed that rationale-augmented training enhances model performance in sentiment classification across both human transcript and ASR settings. Also, we found that the generated rationales typically exhibit different vocabularies compared to human-generated rationales, but maintain similar semantics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Susung Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual content generation, producing high-quality samples across various domains, largely due to classifier-free guidance (CFG). Recent attempts to extend guidance to unconditional models have relied on heuristic techniques, resulting in suboptimal generation quality and unintended effects. In this work, we propose Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), a novel training- and condition-free approach that leverages the energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism to enhance image generation. By defining the energy of self-attention, we introduce a method to reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention and use the output as the unconditional prediction. Practically, we control the curvature of the energy landscape by adjusting the Gaussian kernel parameter while keeping the guidance scale parameter fixed. Additionally, we present a query blurring method that is equivalent to blurring the entire attention weights without incurring quadratic complexity in the number of tokens. In our experiments, SEG achieves a Pareto improvement in both quality and the reduction of side effects. The code is available at https://github.com/SusungHong/SEG-SDXL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Wang, Yuheng Chen, Wanting Wen, Yu Sheng, Linjing Li, Daniel Dajun Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks. Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances. Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions. By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation. Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning. Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs. Code and data will be available soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data from cybercrime forums, which contain extensive information and key discussions about emerging cyber threats. However, to date, the level of accuracy and efficiency of LLMs for such critical tasks has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Hence, this study assesses the performance of an LLM system built on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model [8] to extract CTI information. To do so, a random sample of more than 700 daily conversations from three cybercrime forums - XSS, Exploit_in, and RAMP - was extracted, and the LLM system was instructed to summarize the conversations and predict 10 key CTI variables, such as whether a large organization and/or a critical infrastructure is being targeted, with only simple human-language instructions. Then, two coders reviewed each conversation and evaluated whether the information extracted by the LLM was accurate. The LLM system performed well, with an average accuracy score of 96.23%, an average precision of 90% and an average recall of 88.2%. Various ways to enhance the model were uncovered, such as the need to help the LLM distinguish between stories and past events, as well as being careful with verb tenses in prompts. Nevertheless, the results of this study highlight the relevance of using LLMs for cyber threat intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Xue, Junyu Yan, Raman Dutt, Fasih Haider, Jingshuai Liu, Steven McDonagh, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing models with robust group fairness properties is paramount, particularly in ethically sensitive domains such as medical diagnosis. Recent approaches to achieving fairness in machine learning require a substantial amount of training data and depend on model retraining, which may not be practical in real-world scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, we propose Bias-based Weight Masking Fine-Tuning (BMFT), a novel post-processing method that enhances the fairness of a trained model in significantly fewer epochs without requiring access to the original training data. BMFT produces a mask over model parameters, which efficiently identifies the weights contributing the most towards biased predictions. Furthermore, we propose a two-step debiasing strategy, wherein the feature extractor undergoes initial fine-tuning on the identified bias-influenced weights, succeeded by a fine-tuning phase on a reinitialised classification layer to uphold discriminative performance. Extensive experiments across four dermatological datasets and two sensitive attributes demonstrate that BMFT outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in both diagnostic accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings underscore the efficacy and robustness of BMFT in advancing fairness across various out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Our code is available at: https://github.com/vios-s/BMFT</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yan, Pengyu Wang, Danni Wang, Weiquan Huang, Daniel Watzenig, Huilin Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a significant perception task in autonomous driving. It suffers from the risks of adversarial examples. In the past few years, deep learning has gradually transitioned from convolutional neural network (CNN) models with a relatively small number of parameters to foundation models with a huge number of parameters. The segment-anything model (SAM) is a generalized image segmentation framework that is capable of handling various types of images and is able to recognize and segment arbitrary objects in an image without the need to train on a specific object. It is a unified model that can handle diverse downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and tracking. In the task of semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, it is significant to study the zero-shot adversarial robustness of SAM. Therefore, we deliver a systematic empirical study on the robustness of SAM without additional training. Based on the experimental results, the zero-shot adversarial robustness of the SAM under the black-box corruptions and white-box adversarial attacks is acceptable, even without the need for additional training. The finding of this study is insightful in that the gigantic model parameters and huge amounts of training data lead to the phenomenon of emergence, which builds a guarantee of adversarial robustness. SAM is a vision foundation model that can be regarded as an early prototype of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) pipeline. In such a pipeline, a unified model can handle diverse tasks. Therefore, this research not only inspects the impact of vision foundation models on safe autonomous driving but also provides a perspective on developing trustworthy AGI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenqing Hua, Bozitao Zhong, Sitao Luan, Liang Hong, Guy Wolf, Doina Precup, Shuangjia Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Enzymes, with their specific catalyzed reactions, are necessary for all aspects of life, enabling diverse biological processes and adaptations. Predicting enzyme functions is essential for understanding biological pathways, guiding drug development, enhancing bioproduct yields, and facilitating evolutionary studies. Addressing the inherent complexities, we introduce a new approach to annotating enzymes based on their catalyzed reactions. This method provides detailed insights into specific reactions and is adaptable to newly discovered reactions, diverging from traditional classifications by protein family or expert-derived reaction classes. We employ machine learning algorithms to analyze enzyme reaction datasets, delivering a much more refined view on the functionality of enzymes. Our evaluation leverages the largest enzyme-reaction dataset to date, derived from the SwissProt and Rhea databases with entries up to January 8, 2024. We frame the enzyme-reaction prediction as a retrieval problem, aiming to rank enzymes by their catalytic ability for specific reactions. With our model, we can recruit proteins for novel reactions and predict reactions in novel proteins, facilitating enzyme discovery and function annotation (https://github.com/WillHua127/ReactZyme).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghai Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: We have observed a distinctive quantization-related behavior in the LLaMA3/3.1-70B models that is absent in both the LLaMA2-70B and LLaMA3/3.1/3.2-1B/3B/8B/405B models. Quantization is a crucial technique for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. The impact of W8A8 post-training quantization on model accuracy, especially on the recently released LLaMA3/3.1 model series, remains contentious. In this paper, we explore three key questions: What makes the LLaMA3-70B model series uniquely vulnerable to quantization? Why is this the case? And how can the issue be addressed? We empirically investigate multiple LLMs featured on an open LLM leaderboard, discovering that the LLaMA3-70B model series have a unique accuracy degradation behavior with W8A8 per-channel post-training quantization. In contrast, other model series such as LLaMA2, LLaMA3/3.1-8B, LLaMA3.2, Qwen, Mixtral, Mistral, Phi-3, and Falcon demonstrate robust performance with W8A8. Contrary to previous assertions attributing degradation to the large dynamic range of activations, our findings indicate that the weight distribution of the LLaMA3-70B is the primary factor behind the vulnerability. By meticulously analyzing the distinct characteristics of weight distributions across Transformer blocks, we propose two solutions that make different tradeoffs in hardware/software overhead. First, we propose a mixed strategy where less than 3\% of the layers employ finer per-group W8A8 quantization granularity. Second, we introduce a bi-smoothing strategy that balances quantization errors between weights and activations while maintaining per-channel quantization throughout. Experimental results demonstrate that both strategies effectively preserve the accuracy of the entire LLaMA3-70B model series under W8A8 quantization, achieving performance on par with their FP16 counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Co\c{s}kun, Ananth Grama, Mehmet Koyut\"urk</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained popularity in graph machine learning applications due, in part, to their flexibility in specification of network propagation rules. These propagation rules are often constructed as polynomial filters whose coefficients are learned using label information during training. In contrast to learned polynomial filters, explicit filter functions are useful in capturing relationships between network topology and distribution of labels across the network. A number of algorithms incorporating either approach have been proposed; however the relationship between filter functions and polynomial approximations is not fully resolved. This is largely due to the ill-conditioned nature of the linear systems that must be solved to derive polynomial approximations of filter functions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Arnoldi orthonormalization-based algorithm, along with a unifying approach, called G-Arnoldi-GCN that can efficiently and effectively approximate a given filter function with a polynomial. We evaluate G-Arnoldi-GCN in the context of multi-class node classification across ten datasets with diverse topological characteristics. Our experiments show that G-Arnoldi-GCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when suitable filter functions are employed. Overall, G-Arnoldi-GCN opens important new directions in graph machine learning by enabling the explicit design and application of diverse filter functions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Pantazopoulos, Malvina Nikandrou, Alessandro Suglia, Oliver Lemon, Arash Eshghi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores replacing Transformers in Visual Language Models (VLMs) with Mamba, a recent structured state space model (SSM) that demonstrates promising performance in sequence modeling. We test models up to 3B parameters under controlled conditions, showing that Mamba-based VLMs outperforms Transformers-based VLMs in captioning, question answering, and reading comprehension. However, we find that Transformers achieve greater performance in visual grounding and the performance gap widens with scale. We explore two hypotheses to explain this phenomenon: 1) the effect of task-agnostic visual encoding on the updates of the hidden states, and 2) the difficulty in performing visual grounding from the perspective of in-context multimodal retrieval. Our results indicate that a task-aware encoding yields minimal performance gains on grounding, however, Transformers significantly outperform Mamba at in-context multimodal retrieval. Overall, Mamba shows promising performance on tasks where the correct output relies on a summary of the image but struggles when retrieval of explicit information from the context is required.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lars B\"ocking, Leopold M\"uller, Niklas K\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: The selection of algorithms is a crucial step in designing AI services for real-world time series classification use cases. Traditional methods such as neural architecture search, automated machine learning, combined algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimizations are effective but require considerable computational resources and necessitate access to all data points to run their optimizations. In this work, we introduce a novel data fingerprint that describes any time series classification dataset in a privacy-preserving manner and provides insight into the algorithm selection problem without requiring training on the (unseen) dataset. By decomposing the multi-target regression problem, only our data fingerprints are used to estimate algorithm performance and uncertainty in a scalable and adaptable manner. Our approach is evaluated on the 112 University of California riverside benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the performance of 35 state-of-the-art algorithms and providing valuable insights for effective algorithm selection in time series classification service systems, improving a naive baseline by 7.32% on average in estimating the mean performance and 15.81% in estimating the uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Dengyu Zhang, Junfan Chen, Ying Wen, Qingrui Zhang, Shaoshuai Mou, Wei Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a significant challenge in multi-agent collaboration, aiming to develop agents that can coordinate with unseen partners they have not encountered before. Recent cutting-edge ZSC methods have primarily focused on two-player video games such as OverCooked!2 and Hanabi. In this paper, we extend the scope of ZSC research to the multi-drone cooperative pursuit scenario, exploring how to construct a drone agent capable of coordinating with multiple unseen partners to capture multiple evaders. We propose a novel Hypergraphic Open-ended Learning Algorithm (HOLA-Drone) that continuously adapts the learning objective based on our hypergraphic-form game modeling, aiming to improve cooperative abilities with multiple unknown drone teammates. To empirically verify the effectiveness of HOLA-Drone, we build two different unseen drone teammate pools to evaluate their performance in coordination with various unseen partners. The experimental results demonstrate that HOLA-Drone outperforms the baseline methods in coordination with unseen drone teammates. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the feasibility of HOLA-Drone in physical systems. Videos can be found on the project homepage~\url{https://sites.google.com/view/hola-drone}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mamba and Vision Mamba (Vim) models have shown their potential as an alternative to methods based on Transformer architecture. This work introduces Fast Mamba for Vision (Famba-V), a cross-layer token fusion technique to enhance the training efficiency of Vim models. The key idea of Famba-V is to identify and fuse similar tokens across different Vim layers based on a suit of cross-layer strategies instead of simply applying token fusion uniformly across all the layers that existing works propose. We evaluate the performance of Famba-V on CIFAR-100. Our results show that Famba-V is able to enhance the training efficiency of Vim models by reducing both training time and peak memory usage during training. Moreover, the proposed cross-layer strategies allow Famba-V to deliver superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. These results all together demonstrate Famba-V as a promising efficiency enhancement technique for Vim models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehroush Banday, Sherin Zafar, Parul Agarwal, M Afshar Alam, Abubeker K M</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a severe cardiac disease, and hence, its early diagnosis is essential as it improves treatment results and saves money on medical care. The prevailing development of quantum computing and machine learning (ML) technologies may bring practical improvement to the performance of CHD diagnosis. Quantum machine learning (QML) is receiving tremendous interest in various disciplines due to its higher performance and capabilities. A quantum leap in the healthcare industry will increase processing power and optimise multiple models. Techniques for QML have the potential to forecast cardiac disease and help in early detection. To predict the risk of coronary heart disease, a hybrid approach utilizing an ensemble machine learning model based on QML classifiers is presented in this paper. Our approach, with its unique ability to address multidimensional healthcare data, reassures the method's robustness by fusing quantum and classical ML algorithms in a multi-step inferential framework. The marked rise in heart disease and death rates impacts worldwide human health and the global economy. Reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality requires early detection of heart disease. In this research, a hybrid approach utilizes techniques with quantum computing capabilities to tackle complex problems that are not amenable to conventional machine learning algorithms and to minimize computational expenses. The proposed method has been developed in the Raspberry Pi 5 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform and tested on a broad dataset that integrates clinical and imaging data from patients suffering from CHD and healthy controls. Compared to classical machine learning models, the accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and specificity of the proposed hybrid QML model used with CHD are manifold higher.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santosh Kumar Radha, Yasamin Nouri Jelyani, Ara Ghukasyan, Oktay Goktas</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative human engagement is a common and effective means of leveraging the advanced language processing power of large language models (LLMs). Using well-structured prompts in a conversational manner, human users can effectively influence an LLM to develop more thoughtful and accurate responses. Motivated by this insight, we propose the Iteration of Thought (IoT) framework for enhancing LLM responses by generating "thought"-provoking prompts vis a vis an input query and the current iteration of an LLM's response. Unlike static or semi-static approaches, e.g. Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), IoT adapts its reasoning path dynamically, based on evolving context, and without generating alternate explorative thoughts which are ultimately discarded. The three components of the IoT framework are (1) an Inner Dialogue Agent (IDA) responsible for generating instructive, context-specific prompts; (2) an LLM Agent (LLMA) that processes these prompts to refine its responses; and (3) an iterative prompting loop that implements a conversation between the former two components. We introduce two variants of our framework: Autonomous Iteration of Thought (AIoT), where an LLM decides when to stop iterating, and Guided Iteration of Thought (GIoT), which always forces a fixed number iterations. We investigate the performance of IoT across various datasets, spanning complex reasoning tasks from the GPQA dataset, explorative problem-solving in Game of 24, puzzle solving in Mini Crosswords, and multi-hop question answering from the HotpotQA dataset. Our results show that IoT represents a viable paradigm for autonomous response refinement in LLMs, showcasing significant improvements over CoT and thereby enabling more adaptive and efficient reasoning systems that minimize human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngsun Lim, Hojun Choi, Pin-Yu Chen, Hyunjung Shim</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the impressive success of text-to-image (TTI) generation models, existing studies overlook the issue of whether these models accurately convey factual information. In this paper, we focus on the problem of image hallucination, where images created by generation models fail to faithfully depict factual content. To address this, we introduce I-HallA (Image Hallucination evaluation with Question Answering), a novel automated evaluation metric that measures the factuality of generated images through visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce I-HallA v1.0, a curated benchmark dataset for this purpose. As part of this process, we develop a pipeline that generates high-quality question-answer pairs using multiple GPT-4 Omni-based agents, with human judgments to ensure accuracy. Our evaluation protocols measure image hallucination by testing if images from existing text-to-image models can correctly respond to these questions. The I-HallA v1.0 dataset comprises 1.2K diverse image-text pairs across nine categories with 1,000 rigorously curated questions covering various compositional challenges. We evaluate five text-to-image models using I-HallA and reveal that these state-of-the-art models often fail to accurately convey factual information. Moreover, we validate the reliability of our metric by demonstrating a strong Spearman correlation (rho=0.95) with human judgments. We believe our benchmark dataset and metric can serve as a foundation for developing factually accurate text-to-image generation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose MR HuBo(Motion Retargeting leveraging a HUman BOdy prior), a cost-effective and convenient method to collect high-quality upper body paired <robot, human> pose data, which is essential for data-driven motion retargeting methods. Unlike existing approaches which collect <robot, human> pose data by converting human MoCap poses into robot poses, our method goes in reverse. We first sample diverse random robot poses, and then convert them into human poses. However, since random robot poses can result in extreme and infeasible human poses, we propose an additional technique to sort out extreme poses by exploiting a human body prior trained from a large amount of human pose data. Our data collection method can be used for any humanoid robots, if one designs or optimizes the system's hyperparameters which include a size scale factor and the joint angle ranges for sampling. In addition to this data collection method, we also present a two-stage motion retargeting neural network that can be trained via supervised learning on a large amount of paired data. Compared to other learning-based methods trained via unsupervised learning, we found that our deep neural network trained with ample high-quality paired data achieved notable performance. Our experiments also show that our data filtering method yields better retargeting results than training the model with raw and noisy data.

<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a key training strategy for large language models. However, its reliance on fewer trainable parameters poses security risks, such as task-agnostic backdoors. Despite their severe impact on a wide range of tasks, there is no practical defense solution available that effectively counters task-agnostic backdoors within the context of PEFT. In this study, we introduce Obliviate, a PEFT-integrable backdoor defense. We develop two techniques aimed at amplifying benign neurons within PEFT layers and penalizing the influence of trigger tokens. Our evaluations across three major PEFT architectures show that our method can significantly reduce the attack success rate of the state-of-the-art task-agnostic backdoors (83.6%$\downarrow$). Furthermore, our method exhibits robust defense capabilities against both task-specific backdoors and adaptive attacks. Source code will be obtained at https://github.com/obliviateARR/Obliviate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Chanin, James Wilken-Smith, Tom\'a\v{s} Dulka, Hardik Bhatnagar, Joseph Bloom</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach to decompose the activations of Large Language Models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latents. In this paper, we pose two questions. First, to what extent do SAEs extract monosemantic and interpretable latents? Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Feuer, Micah Goldblum, Teresa Datta, Sanjana Nambiar, Raz Besaleli, Samuel Dooley, Max Cembalest, John P. Dickerson</p>
<p>Abstract: The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 sparked an explosion of interest in post-training and an avalanche of new preference optimization (PO) methods. These methods claim superior alignment by virtue of better correspondence with human pairwise preferences, often measured by LLM-judges. In this work, we attempt to answer the following question -- do LLM-judge preferences translate to progress on other, more concrete metrics for alignment, and if not, why not? We define a concrete metric for alignment, and introduce SOS-Bench (Substance Outweighs Style Benchmark), which is to the best of our knowledge the largest standardized, reproducible LLM meta-benchmark to date. We find that (1) LLM-judge preferences do not correlate with concrete measures of safety, world knowledge, and instruction following; (2) LLM-judges have powerful implicit biases, prioritizing style over factuality and safety; and (3) the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage of post-training, and not the PO stage, has the greatest impact on alignment, with data scaling and prompt diversity as the driving factors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> East Sun, Yan Wang, Lan Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead, Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiale Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable training results by freezing the original weights and training only low-rank matrices, establishing itself as the predominant fine-tuning method for LLMs. In pursuit of performance closer to full-parameter training, a series of LoRA variants have emerged, such as LoRA+, PISSA, Olora, and LoRA-GA. However, these improvements complicate the initial setup of model training and increase initialization time. More importantly, they overlook the internal interactions of the original weight information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel theory, ``Weight Guide'' aimed at continuously guiding trainable matrices through the original weights during training to enhance the utilization of weight information. Based on this theory, we designed a new PEFT technique called Bone (\textbf{B}l\textbf{o}ck Affi\textbf{ne}), which not only enhances the utilization of original weight information but also emphasizes the internal connections between weights, leading to faster convergence and better data fitting. Experimental comparisons across two different LLM architectures (LLaMA2, RWKV6) and various parameter scales demonstrate that the Bone structure can achieve rapid convergence and superior data fitting without the need for complex initialization. For example, when fine-tuning LLaMA2-7B on the MetaMathQA dataset and validating on GSM8k and math benchmarks, Bone achieved fine-tuning scores of 49.36 and 8.8, respectively, outperforming PISSA by 5.84\% and 1.96\%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenlin Wu, Xiaoyu He, Zike Li, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Yue, Jian Li, Guiliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: To obtain the optimal constraints in complex environments, Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) seeks to recover these constraints from expert demonstrations in a data-driven manner. Existing ICRL algorithms collect training samples from an interactive environment. However, the efficacy and efficiency of these sampling strategies remain unknown. To bridge this gap, we introduce a strategic exploration framework with guaranteed efficiency. Specifically, we define a feasible constraint set for ICRL problems and investigate how expert policy and environmental dynamics influence the optimality of constraints. Motivated by our findings, we propose two exploratory algorithms to achieve efficient constraint inference via 1) dynamically reducing the bounded aggregate error of cost estimation and 2) strategically constraining the exploration policy. Both algorithms are theoretically grounded with tractable sample complexity. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms under various environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Zhao, Tao Shen, Didi Zhu, Zexi Li, Jing Su, Xuwu Wang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to various domains due to its modular design and widespread availability on platforms like Huggingface. This modularity has sparked interest in combining multiple LoRAs to enhance LLM capabilities. However, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific adaptations that require additional training, and current model merging techniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to parameter interference and performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of disassembling and reassembling multiple LoRAs at a finer granularity, analogous to assembling LEGO blocks. We introduce the concept of Minimal Semantic Units (MSUs), where the parameters corresponding to each rank in LoRA function as independent units. These MSUs demonstrate permutation invariance and concatenation-summation equivalence properties, enabling flexible combinations to create new LoRAs. Building on these insights, we propose the LoRA-LEGO framework. This framework conducts rank-wise parameter clustering by grouping MSUs from different LoRAs into $k$ clusters. The centroid of each cluster serves as a representative MSU, enabling the assembly of a merged LoRA with an adjusted rank of $k$. Additionally, we apply a dual reweighting strategy to optimize the scale of the merged LoRA. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in LoRA merging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziquan Wei, Tingting Dan, Jiaqi Ding, Guorong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including HCP and UK Biobank under supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengan Huang, Gongxian Zeng, Xin Mu, Yu Wang, Yue Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of \emph{multi-designated detector watermarking (MDDW)} for large language models (LLMs). This technique allows model providers to generate watermarked outputs from LLMs with two key properties: (i) only specific, possibly multiple, designated detectors can identify the watermarks, and (ii) there is no perceptible degradation in the output quality for ordinary users. We formalize the security definitions for MDDW and present a framework for constructing MDDW for any LLM using multi-designated verifier signatures (MDVS). Recognizing the significant economic value of LLM outputs, we introduce claimability as an optional security feature for MDDW, enabling model providers to assert ownership of LLM outputs within designated-detector settings. To support claimable MDDW, we propose a generic transformation converting any MDVS to a claimable MDVS. Our implementation of the MDDW scheme highlights its advanced functionalities and flexibility over existing methods, with satisfactory performance metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuai Zhao, Leilei Gan, Zhongliang Guo, Xiaobao Wu, Luwei Xiao, Xiaoyu Xu, Cong-Duy Nguyen, Luu Anh Tuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite being widely applied due to their exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning. However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from weak to strong based on feature alignment-enhanced knowledge distillation (W2SAttack). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through feature alignment-enhanced knowledge distillation, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that W2SAttack has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of W2SAttack on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Helin Cao, Sven Behnke</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving, incorporating multiple sensors and corresponding computer vision algorithms. 3D LiDAR sensors are widely used to capture sparse point clouds of the vehicle's surroundings. However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets and our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art for SSC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaepill Choi, Kyubyung Chae, Jiwoo Song, Yohan Jo, Taesup Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: In abstractive summarization, the challenge of producing concise and accurate summaries arises from the vast amount of information contained in the source document. Consequently, although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, they often introduce inaccuracies by hallucinating content not found in the original source. While supervised fine-tuning methods that maximize likelihood contribute to this issue, they do not consistently enhance the faithfulness of the summaries. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align with human preferences. However, these methods still heavily depend on costly human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel and straightforward approach called Model-based Preference Optimization (MPO) to fine-tune LLMs for improved summarization abilities without any human feedback. By leveraging the model's inherent summarization capabilities, we create a preference dataset that is fully generated by the model using different decoding strategies. Our experiments on standard summarization datasets and various metrics demonstrate that our proposed MPO significantly enhances the quality of generated summaries without relying on human feedback.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulated patient systems play a crucial role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative learning environments and enabling clinical decision-making simulations. Large Language Models (LLM) could advance simulated patient systems by replicating medical conditions and patient-doctor interactions with high fidelity and low cost. However, ensuring the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient, an advanced simulated patient system with AIPatient Knowledge Graph (AIPatient KG) as the input and the Reasoning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Reasoning RAG) agentic workflow as the generation backbone. AIPatient KG samples data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, producing a clinically diverse and relevant cohort of 1,495 patients with high knowledgebase validity (F1 0.89). Reasoning RAG leverages six LLM powered agents spanning tasks including retrieval, KG query generation, abstraction, checker, rewrite, and summarization. This agentic framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.15% in EHR-based medical Question Answering (QA), outperforming benchmarks that use either no agent or only partial agent integration. Our system also presents high readability (median Flesch Reading Ease 77.23; median Flesch Kincaid Grade 5.6), robustness (ANOVA F-value 0.6126, p>0.1), and stability (ANOVA F-value 0.782, p>0.1). The promising performance of the AIPatient system highlights its potential to support a wide range of applications, including medical education, model evaluation, and system integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subash Timilsina, Sagar Shrestha, Xiao Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: A core task in multi-modal learning is to integrate information from multiple feature spaces (e.g., text and audio), offering modality-invariant essential representations of data. Recent research showed that, classical tools such as {\it canonical correlation analysis} (CCA) provably identify the shared components up to minor ambiguities, when samples in each modality are generated from a linear mixture of shared and private components. Such identifiability results were obtained under the condition that the cross-modality samples are aligned/paired according to their shared information. This work takes a step further, investigating shared component identifiability from multi-modal linear mixtures where cross-modality samples are unaligned. A distribution divergence minimization-based loss is proposed, under which a suite of sufficient conditions ensuring identifiability of the shared components are derived. Our conditions are based on cross-modality distribution discrepancy characterization and density-preserving transform removal, which are much milder than existing studies relying on independent component analysis. More relaxed conditions are also provided via adding reasonable structural constraints, motivated by available side information in various applications. The identifiability claims are thoroughly validated using synthetic and real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahed Masoudian, Markus Frohman, Navid Rekabsaz, Markus Schedl</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models frequently inherit societal biases from their training data. Numerous techniques have been proposed to mitigate these biases during both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. However, fine-tuning a pre-trained debiased language model on a downstream task can reintroduce biases into the model. Additionally, existing debiasing methods for downstream tasks either (i) require labels of protected attributes (e.g., age, race, or political views) that are often not available or (ii) rely on indicators of bias, which restricts their applicability to gender debiasing since they rely on gender-specific words. To address this, we introduce a novel debiasing regularization technique based on the class-wise variance of embeddings. Crucially, our method does not require attribute labels and targets any attribute, thus addressing the shortcomings of existing debiasing methods. Our experiments on encoder language models and three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong debiasing baselines that rely on target attribute labels while maintaining performance on the target task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient technology for updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs), attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of effective measures to prevent the malicious misuse of this technology, which could lead to harmful edits in LLMs. These malicious modifications could cause LLMs to generate toxic content, misleading users into inappropriate actions. In front of this risk, we introduce a new task, Knowledge Editing Type Identification (KETI), aimed at identifying different types of edits in LLMs, thereby providing timely alerts to users when encountering illicit edits. As part of this task, we propose KETIBench, which includes five types of harmful edits covering most popular toxic types, as well as one benign factual edit. We develop four classical classification models and three BERT-based models as baseline identifiers for both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our experimental results, across 42 trials involving two models and three knowledge editing methods, demonstrate that all seven baseline identifiers achieve decent identification performance, highlighting the feasibility of identifying malicious edits in LLMs. Additional analyses reveal that the performance of the identifiers is independent of the reliability of the knowledge editing methods and exhibits cross-domain generalization, enabling the identification of edits from unknown sources.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengxin Zheng, Junzhong Ji, Yanzhao Shi, Xiaodan Zhang, Liangqiong Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain CT report generation is significant to aid physicians in diagnosing cranial diseases. Recent studies concentrate on handling the consistency between visual and textual pathological features to improve the coherence of report. However, there exist some challenges: 1) Redundant visual representing: Massive irrelevant areas in 3D scans distract models from representing salient visual contexts. 2) Shifted semantic representing: Limited medical corpus causes difficulties for models to transfer the learned textual representations to generative layers. This study introduces a Pathological Clue-driven Representation Learning (PCRL) model to build cross-modal representations based on pathological clues and naturally adapt them for accurate report generation. Specifically, we construct pathological clues from perspectives of segmented regions, pathological entities, and report themes, to fully grasp visual pathological patterns and learn cross-modal feature representations. To adapt the representations for the text generation task, we bridge the gap between representation learning and report generation by using a unified large language model (LLM) with task-tailored instructions. These crafted instructions enable the LLM to be flexibly fine-tuned across tasks and smoothly transfer the semantic representation for report generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods and achieves SoTA performance. Our code is available at "https://github.com/Chauncey-Jheng/PCRL-MRG".</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqiang Yuan, Weitong Chen, Hanlin Wang, Kai Yu, Xin Peng, Yiling Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages.
  In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuho Lee, Taewon Yun, Jason Cai, Hang Su, Hwanjun Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks for summarization quality evaluation often lack diverse input scenarios, focus on narrowly defined dimensions (e.g., faithfulness), and struggle with subjective and coarse-grained annotation schemes. To address these shortcomings, we create UniSumEval benchmark, which extends the range of input context (e.g., domain, length) and provides fine-grained, multi-dimensional annotations. We use AI assistance in data creation, identifying potentially hallucinogenic input texts, and also helping human annotators reduce the difficulty of fine-grained annotation tasks. With UniSumEval, we benchmark nine latest language models as summarizers, offering insights into their performance across varying input contexts and evaluation dimensions. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough comparison of SOTA automated summary evaluators. Our benchmark data will be available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/UniSumEval-v1.0.</p>

<p>Abstract: ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming multiple fields, offering powerful tools for a wide range of applications. These models, commonly trained on vast datasets, exhibit human-like text generation capabilities, making them useful for research tasks such as ideation, literature review, coding, drafting, and outreach. We conducted a study involving 13 astronomers at different career stages and research fields to explore LLM applications across diverse tasks over several months and to evaluate their performance in research-related activities. This work was accompanied by an anonymous survey assessing participants' experiences and attitudes towards LLMs. We provide a detailed analysis of the tasks attempted and the survey answers, along with specific output examples. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in supporting research while also addressing general and research-specific ethical considerations. We conclude with a series of recommendations, emphasizing the need for researchers to complement LLMs with critical thinking and domain expertise, ensuring these tools serve as aids rather than substitutes for rigorous scientific inquiry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osama Mustafa</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of deep learning in cancer research, particularly in early diagnosis, case understanding, and treatment strategy design, emphasizes the need for high-quality data. Generative AI, especially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has emerged as a leading solution to challenges like class imbalance, robust learning, and model training, while addressing issues stemming from patient privacy and the scarcity of real data. Despite their promise, GANs face several challenges, both inherent and specific to histopathology data. Inherent issues include training imbalance, mode collapse, linear learning from insufficient discriminator feedback, and hard boundary convergence due to stringent feedback. Histopathology data presents a unique challenge with its complex representation, high spatial resolution, and multiscale features. To address these challenges, we propose a framework consisting of two components. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based Multistage Progressive Finetuning Siamese Neural Network (MFT-SNN) for assessing the similarity between histopathology patches. Second, we implement a Reinforcement Learning-based External Optimizer (RL-EO) within the GAN training loop, serving as a reward signal generator. The modified discriminator loss function incorporates a weighted reward, guiding the GAN to maximize this reward while minimizing loss. This approach offers an external optimization guide to the discriminator, preventing generator overfitting and ensuring smooth convergence. Our proposed solution has been benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) GANs and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic model, outperforming previous SOTA across various metrics, including FID score, KID score, Perceptual Path Length, and downstream classification tasks.</p>
