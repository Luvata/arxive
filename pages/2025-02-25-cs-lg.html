<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashlesha Akella, Krishnasuri Narayanam</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring data quality in large tabular datasets is a critical challenge, typically addressed through data wrangling tasks. Traditional statistical methods, though efficient, cannot often understand the semantic context and deep learning approaches are resource-intensive, requiring task and dataset-specific training. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an automated system that utilizes large language models to generate executable code for tasks like missing value imputation, error detection, and error correction. Our system aims to identify inherent patterns in the data while leveraging external knowledge, effectively addressing both memory-dependent and memory-independent tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> D. Denipitiyage, B. Silva, S. Seneviratne, A. Seneviratne, S. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite regulatory efforts to establish reliable content-rating guidelines for mobile apps, the process of assigning content ratings in the Google Play Store remains self-regulated by the app developers. There is no straightforward method of verifying developer-assigned content ratings manually due to the overwhelming scale or automatically due to the challenging problem of interpreting textual and visual data and correlating them with content ratings. We propose and evaluate a visionlanguage approach to predict the content ratings of mobile game applications and detect content rating violations, using a dataset of metadata of popular Android games. Our method achieves ~6% better relative accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art CLIP-fine-tuned model in a multi-modal setting. Applying our classifier in the wild, we detected more than 70 possible cases of content rating violations, including nine instances with the 'Teacher Approved' badge. Additionally, our findings indicate that 34.5% of the apps identified by our classifier as violating content ratings were removed from the Play Store. In contrast, the removal rate for correctly classified apps was only 27%. This discrepancy highlights the practical effectiveness of our classifier in identifying apps that are likely to be removed based on user complaints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matilde Valente, Tiago C. Dias, Vasco Guerra, Rodrigo Ventura</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven machine learning models often require extensive datasets, which can be costly or inaccessible, and their predictions may fail to comply with established physical laws. Current approaches for incorporating physical priors mitigate these issues by penalizing deviations from known physical laws, as in physics-informed neural networks, or by designing architectures that automatically satisfy specific invariants. However, penalization approaches do not guarantee compliance with physical constraints for unseen inputs, and invariant-based methods lack flexibility and generality. We propose a novel physics-consistent machine learning method that directly enforces compliance with physical principles by projecting model outputs onto the manifold defined by these laws. This procedure ensures that predictions inherently adhere to the chosen physical constraints, improving reliability and interpretability. Our method is demonstrated on two systems: a spring-mass system and a low-temperature reactive plasma. Compared to purely data-driven models, our approach significantly reduces errors in physical law compliance, enhances predictive accuracy of physical quantities, and outperforms alternatives when working with simpler models or limited datasets. The proposed projection-based technique is versatile and can function independently or in conjunction with existing physics-informed neural networks, offering a powerful, general, and scalable solution for developing fast and reliable surrogate models of complex physical systems, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Quadir, M. Tanveer</p>
<p>Abstract: Restricted kernel machines (RKMs) have considerably improved generalization in machine learning. Recent advancements explored various techniques within the RKM framework, integrating kernel functions with least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) to mirror the energy function of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), leading to enhanced performance. However, RKMs may face challenges in generalization when dealing with unevenly distributed or complexly clustered data. Additionally, as the dataset size increases, the computational burden of managing high-dimensional feature spaces can become substantial, potentially hindering performance in large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose twin restricted kernel machine (TRKM). TRKM combines the benefits of twin models with the robustness of the RKM framework to enhance classification and regression tasks. By leveraging the Fenchel-Young inequality, we introduce a novel conjugate feature duality, allowing the formulation of classification and regression problems in terms of dual variables. This duality provides an upper bound to the objective function of the TRKM problem, resulting in a new methodology under the RKM framework. The model uses an energy function similar to that of RBM, incorporating both visible and hidden variables corresponding to both classes. Additionally, the kernel trick is employed to map data into a high-dimensional feature space, where the model identifies an optimal separating hyperplane using a regularized least squares approach. Experiments on UCI and KEEL datasets confirm TRKM's superiority over baselines, showcasing its robustness and efficiency in handling complex data. Furthermore, We implemented the TRKM model on the brain age dataset, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting brain age.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15760">Digi-Q: Learning Q-Value Functions for Training Device-Control Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Bai, Yifei Zhou, Li Erran Li, Sergey Levine, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: While a number of existing approaches for building foundation model agents rely on prompting or fine-tuning with human demonstrations, it is not sufficient in dynamic environments (e.g., mobile device control). On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) should address these limitations, but collecting actual rollouts in an environment is often undesirable in truly open-ended agentic problems such as mobile device control or interacting with humans, where each unit of interaction is associated with a cost. In such scenarios, a method for policy learning that can utilize off-policy experience by learning a trained action-value function is much more effective. In this paper, we develop an approach, called Digi-Q, to train VLM-based action-value Q-functions which are then used to extract the agent policy. We study our approach in the mobile device control setting. Digi-Q trains the Q-function using offline temporal-difference (TD) learning, on top of frozen, intermediate-layer features of a VLM. Compared to fine-tuning the whole VLM, this approach saves us compute and enhances scalability. To make the VLM features amenable for representing the Q-function, we need to employ an initial phase of fine-tuning to amplify coverage over actionable information needed for value function. Once trained, we use this Q-function via a Best-of-N policy extraction operator that imitates the best action out of multiple candidate actions from the current policy as ranked by the value function, enabling policy improvement without environment interaction. Digi-Q outperforms several prior methods on user-scale device control tasks in Android-in-the-Wild, attaining 21.2% improvement over prior best-performing method. In some cases, our Digi-Q approach already matches state-of-the-art RL methods that require interaction. The project is open-sourced at https://github.com/DigiRL-agent/digiq</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15764">High-Throughput Computational Screening and Interpretable Machine Learning of Metal-organic Frameworks for Iodine Capture</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyi Tan, Yukun Teng, Guangcun Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: The removal of leaked radioactive iodine isotopes in humid environments holds significant importance in nuclear waste management and nuclear accident mitigation. In this study, high-throughput computational screening and machine learning were combined to reveal the iodine capture performance of 1816 metal-organic framework (MOF) materials under humid air conditions. Firstly, the relationship between the structural characteristics of MOFs and their adsorption properties was explored, with the aim of identifying the optimal structural parameters for iodine capture. Subsequently, two machine learning regression algorithms - Random Forest and CatBoost, were employed to predict the iodine adsorption capabilities of MOFs. In addition to 6 structural features, 25 molecular features and 8 chemical features were incorporated to enhance the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was assessed to determine the relative influence of various features on iodine adsorption performance, in which the Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption to iodine were found the two most crucial chemical factors. Furthermore, four types of molecular fingerprints were introduced for providing comprehensive and detailed structural information of MOF materials. The top 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were picked out, revealing that the presence of six-membered ring structures and nitrogen atoms in the MOFs were the key structural factors that enhanced iodine adsorption, followed by the existence of oxygen atoms. This work combined high-throughput computation, machine learning, and molecular fingerprints to comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted factors influencing the iodine adsorption performance of MOFs, offering profound insightful guidelines for screening and structural design of advanced MOF materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Behrooz Azarkhalili, Maxwell Libbrecht</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Generalized Attention Flow (GAF), a novel feature attribution method for Transformer-based models to address the limitations of current approaches. By extending Attention Flow and replacing attention weights with the generalized Information Tensor, GAF integrates attention weights, their gradients, the maximum flow problem, and the barrier method to enhance the performance of feature attributions. The proposed method exhibits key theoretical properties and mitigates the shortcomings of prior techniques that rely solely on simple aggregation of attention weights. Our comprehensive benchmarking on sequence classification tasks demonstrates that a specific variant of GAF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feature attribution methods in most evaluation settings, providing a more reliable interpretation of Transformer model outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zishuo Lin, Jiajie Wang, Zhe Yan, Peiyong Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The crucial field of Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) aims to transform chemical structure photographs into machine-readable formats so that chemical databases may be efficiently stored and queried. Although a number of OCSR technologies have been created, little is known about how well they work in different picture deterioration scenarios. In this work, a new dataset of chemically structured images that have been systematically harmed graphically by compression, noise, distortion, and black overlays is presented. On these subsets, publicly accessible OCSR tools were thoroughly tested to determine how resilient they were to unfavorable circumstances. The outcomes show notable performance variation, underscoring each tool's advantages and disadvantages. Interestingly, MolScribe performed best under heavy compression (55.8% at 99%) and had the highest identification rate on undamaged photos (94.6%). MolVec performed exceptionally well against noise and black overlay (86.8% at 40%), although it declined under extreme distortion (<70%). With recognition rates below 30%, Decimer demonstrated strong sensitivity to noise and black overlay, but Imago had the lowest baseline accuracy (73.6%). The creative assessment of this study offers important new information about how well the OCSR tool performs when images deteriorate, as well as useful standards for tool development in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: The squared error normalized by the target output is known as the information processing capacity (IPC) and is used to evaluate the performance of reservoir computing (RC). Since RC aims to learn the relationship between input and output time series, we should evaluate the IPC for infinitely long data rather than the IPC for finite-length data. To evaluate the IPC for infinitely long data using the IPC for finite-length data, we use an asymptotic expansion of the IPC and the least-squares method. Then, we show the validity of our method by numerical simulations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Solving complex tasks in a single attempt is challenging for large language models (LLMs). Iterative interaction with the environment and feedback is often required to achieve success, making effective feedback utilization a critical topic. Existing approaches either struggle with length generalization or rely on naive retries without leveraging prior information. In this paper, we introduce FTTT, a novel paradigm that formulates feedback utilization as an optimization problem at test time. Additionally, we propose a learnable test-time optimizer, OpTune, to effectively exploit feedback. Experiments on two LLMs across four reasoning datasets demonstrate that FTTT and OpTune achieve superior scalability and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Euntae Choi, Sumin Song, Woosang Lim, Sungjoo Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition. Code will be made available at blind_review.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhilash Neog, Arka Daw, Sepideh Fatemi Khorasgani, Anuj Karpatne</p>
<p>Abstract: A significant challenge in time-series (TS) modeling is the presence of missing values in real-world TS datasets. Traditional two-stage frameworks, involving imputation followed by modeling, suffer from two key drawbacks: (1) the propagation of imputation errors into subsequent TS modeling, (2) the trade-offs between imputation efficacy and imputation complexity. While one-stage approaches attempt to address these limitations, they often struggle with scalability or fully leveraging partially observed features. To this end, we propose a novel imputation-free approach for handling missing values in time series termed Missing Feature-aware Time Series Modeling (MissTSM) with two main innovations. First, we develop a novel embedding scheme that treats every combination of time-step and feature (or channel) as a distinct token. Second, we introduce a novel Missing Feature-Aware Attention (MFAA) Layer to learn latent representations at every time-step based on partially observed features. We evaluate the effectiveness of MissTSM in handling missing values over multiple benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhananjay Saikumar, Blesson Varghese</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network pruning is essential for reducing model complexity to enable deployment on resource constrained hardware. While performance loss of pruned networks is often attributed to the removal of critical parameters, we identify signal collapse a reduction in activation variance across layers as the root cause. Existing one shot pruning methods focus on weight selection strategies and rely on computationally expensive second order approximations. In contrast, we demonstrate that mitigating signal collapse, rather than optimizing weight selection, is key to improving accuracy of pruned networks. We propose REFLOW that addresses signal collapse without updating trainable weights, revealing high quality sparse sub networks within the original parameter space. REFLOW enables magnitude pruning to achieve state of the art performance, restoring ResNeXt101 accuracy from under 4.1% to 78.9% on ImageNet with only 20% of the weights retained, surpassing state of the art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we address an anomaly detection problem in smart power grids using Multimodal Subspace Support Vector Data Description (MS-SVDD). This approach aims to leverage better feature relations by considering the data as coming from different modalities. These data are projected into a shared lower-dimensionality subspace which aims to preserve their inner characteristics. To supplement the previous work on this subject, we introduce novel multimodal graph-embedded regularizers that leverage graph information for every modality to enhance the training process, and we consider an improved training equation that allows us to maximize or minimize each modality according to the specified criteria. We apply this regularized graph-embedded model on a 3-modalities dataset after having generalized MS-SVDD algorithms to any number of modalities. To set up our application, we propose a whole preprocessing procedure to extract One-Class Classification training instances from time-bounded event time series that are used to evaluate both the reliability and earliness of our model for Event Detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yudong W. Xu, Wenhao Li, Scott Sanner, Elias B. Khalil</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a Transformer-based framework for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). CSPs find use in many applications and thus accelerating their solution with machine learning is of wide interest. Most existing approaches rely on supervised learning from feasible solutions or reinforcement learning, paradigms that require either feasible solutions to these NP-Complete CSPs or large training budgets and a complex expert-designed reward signal. To address these challenges, we propose ConsFormer, a self-supervised framework that leverages a Transformer as a solution refiner. ConsFormer constructs a solution to a CSP iteratively in a process that mimics local search. Instead of using feasible solutions as labeled data, we devise differentiable approximations to the discrete constraints of a CSP to guide model training. Our model is trained to improve random assignments for a single step but is deployed iteratively at test time, circumventing the bottlenecks of supervised and reinforcement learning. Our method can tackle out-of-distribution CSPs simply through additional iterations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhou, Heng Li, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Xudong Yan, Mario Fritz, Margret Keuper</p>
<p>Abstract: Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to curb overconfidence in neural network predictions and enhance generalization. However, previous research shows that LS can force feature representations into excessively tight clusters, eroding intra-class distinctions. More recent findings suggest that LS also induces overconfidence in misclassifications, yet the precise mechanism remained unclear. In this work, we decompose the loss term introduced by LS, revealing two key components: (i) a regularization term that functions only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-enhancement term that emerges under misclassifications. This latter term compels the model to reinforce incorrect predictions with exaggerated certainty, further collapsing the feature space. To address these issues, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which uniformly applies the intended regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit instead of the ground-truth logit. Through feature analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Extensive experiments on image classification and downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Tang, Brenden Lake, Mehrdad Jazayeri</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional generalization-the systematic combination of known components into novel structures-remains a core challenge in cognitive science and machine learning. Although transformer-based large language models can exhibit strong performance on certain compositional tasks, the underlying mechanisms driving these abilities remain opaque, calling into question their interpretability. In this work, we identify and mechanistically interpret the circuit responsible for compositional induction in a compact transformer. Using causal ablations, we validate the circuit and formalize its operation using a program-like description. We further demonstrate that this mechanistic understanding enables precise activation edits to steer the model's behavior predictably. Our findings advance the understanding of complex behaviors in transformers and highlight such insights can provide a direct pathway for model control.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15802">A General Error-Theoretical Analysis Framework for Constructing Compression Strategies</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Zhang, Daning Cheng, Yunquan Zhang, Meiqi Tu, Fangmin Liu, Jiake Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: The exponential growth in parameter size and computational complexity of deep models poses significant challenges for efficient deployment. The core problem of existing compression methods is that different layers of the model have significant differences in their tolerance to compression levels. For instance, the first layer of a model can typically sustain a higher compression level compared to the last layer without compromising performance. Thus, the key challenge lies in how to allocate compression levels across layers in a way that minimizes performance loss while maximizing parameter reduction. To address this challenge, we propose a Compression Error Theory (CET) framework, designed to determine the optimal compression level for each layer. Taking quantization as an example, CET leverages differential expansion and algebraic geometry to reconstruct the quadratic form of quantization error as ellipsoids and hyperbolic paraboloids, and utilizes their geometric structures to define an error subspace. To identify the error subspace with minimal performance loss, by performing orthogonal decomposition of the geometric space, CET transforms the optimization process of the error subspace into a complementary problem. The final theoretical analysis shows that constructing the quantization subspace along the major axis results in minimal performance degradation. Through experimental verification of the theory, CET can greatly retain performance while compressing. Specifically, on the ResNet-34 model, CET achieves nearly 11$\times$ parameter compression while even surpassing performance comparable to the original model.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce FragFM, a novel fragment-based discrete flow matching framework for molecular graph generation.FragFM generates molecules at the fragment level, leveraging a coarse-to-fine autoencoding mechanism to reconstruct atom-level details. This approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining high chemical validity, enabling more efficient and scalable molecular generation. We benchmark FragFM against state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based models on standard molecular generation benchmarks and natural product datasets, demonstrating superior performance in validity, property control, and sampling efficiency. Notably, FragFM achieves over 99\% validity with significantly fewer sampling steps, improving scalability while preserving molecular diversity. These results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Tian, Shu Zou, Zhaoyuan Yang, Mengqi He, Jing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot adaptation for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) presents a dilemma: balancing in-distribution accuracy with out-of-distribution generalization. Recent research has utilized low-level concepts such as visual attributes to enhance generalization. However, this study reveals that VLMs overly rely on a small subset of attributes on decision-making, which co-occur with the category but are not inherently part of it, termed spuriously correlated attributes. This biased nature of VLMs results in poor generalization. To address this, 1) we first propose Spurious Attribute Probing (SAP), identifying and filtering out these problematic attributes to significantly enhance the generalization of existing attribute-based methods; 2) We introduce Spurious Attribute Shielding (SAS), a plug-and-play module that mitigates the influence of these attributes on prediction, seamlessly integrating into various Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods. In experiments, SAP and SAS significantly enhance accuracy on distribution shifts across 11 datasets and 3 generalization tasks without compromising downstream performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an attractive and energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their sparse binary activation. When SNN meets Transformer, it shows great potential in 2D image processing. However, their application for 3D point cloud remains underexplored. To this end, we present Spiking Point Transformer (SPT), the first transformer-based SNN framework for point cloud classification. Specifically, we first design Queue-Driven Sampling Direct Encoding for point cloud to reduce computational costs while retaining the most effective support points at each time step. We introduce the Hybrid Dynamics Integrate-and-Fire Neuron (HD-IF), designed to simulate selective neuron activation and reduce over-reliance on specific artificial neurons. SPT attains state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets that span both real-world and synthetic datasets in the SNN domain. Meanwhile, the theoretical energy consumption of SPT is at least 6.4$\times$ less than its ANN counterpart.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofei Yin, Yijie Hong, Ya Guo, Yi Tu, Weiqiang Wang, Gongshen Liu, Huijia zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of multimodal language models, understanding the nuanced meanings conveyed through visual cues - such as satire, insult, or critique - remains a significant challenge. Existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on direct tasks like image captioning or are limited to a narrow set of categories, such as humor or satire, for deep semantic understanding. To address this gap, we introduce, for the first time, a comprehensive, multi-level Chinese-based benchmark designed specifically for evaluating the understanding of implicit meanings in images. This benchmark is systematically categorized into four subtasks: surface-level content understanding, symbolic meaning interpretation, background knowledge comprehension, and implicit meaning comprehension. We propose an innovative semi-automatic method for constructing datasets, adhering to established construction protocols. Using this benchmark, we evaluate 15 open-source large vision language models (LVLMs) and GPT-4o, revealing that even the best-performing model lags behind human performance by nearly 14% in understanding implicit meaning. Our findings underscore the intrinsic challenges current LVLMs face in grasping nuanced visual semantics, highlighting significant opportunities for future research and development in this domain. We will publicly release our InsightVision dataset, code upon acceptance of the paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the capability of AI to solve problems in theoretical physics, focusing on high-energy theory and cosmology. The first iteration of our benchmark consists of 57 problems of varying difficulty, from undergraduate to research level. These problems are novel in the sense that they do not come from public problem collections. We evaluate our data set on various open and closed language models, including o3-mini, o1, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o and versions of Llama and Qwen. While we find impressive progress in model performance with the most recent models, our research-level difficulty problems are mostly unsolved. We address challenges of auto-verifiability and grading, and discuss common failure modes. While currently state-of-the art models are still of limited use for researchers, our results show that AI assisted theoretical physics research may become possible in the near future. We discuss the main obstacles towards this goal and possible strategies to overcome them.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyue Hua, Tyler Wong, Sun Fei, Liangming Pan, Adam Jardine, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities.

<p>Abstract: In oncology, recurrence after treatment is one of the major challenges, related to patients' survival and quality of life. Conventionally, prediction of cancer relapse has always relied on clinical observation with statistical model support, which almost fails to explain the complex, multifactorial nature of tumor recurrence. This research explores how AI and ML models may increase the accuracy and reliability of recurrence prediction in cancer. Therefore, AI and ML create new opportunities not only for personalized medicine but also for proactive management of patients through analyzing large volumes of data on genetics, clinical manifestations, and treatment. The paper describes the various AI and ML techniques for pattern identification and outcome prediction in cancer patients using supervised and unsupervised learning. Clinical implications provide an opportunity to review how early interventions could happen and the design of treatment planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parichat Suknark, Sompote Youwaib, Tipok Kitkobsin, Sirintornthep Towprayoon, Chart Chiemchaisri, Komsilp Wangyao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of shear strength parameters in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) remains a critical challenge in geotechnical engineering due to the heterogeneous nature of waste materials and their temporal evolution through degradation processes. This paper presents a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for evaluating cohesion and friction angle across diverse MSW compositional profiles. The proposed model integrates a multi-layer perceptron architecture with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to provide transparent insights into how specific waste components influence strength characteristics. Training data encompassed large-scale direct shear tests across various waste compositions and degradation states. The model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional gradient boosting methods, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of 7.42% and 14.96% for friction angle and cohesion predictions, respectively. Through SHAP analysis, the study revealed that fibrous materials and particle size distribution were primary drivers of shear strength variation, with food waste and plastics showing significant but non-linear effects. The model's explainability component successfully quantified these relationships, enabling evidence-based recommendations for waste management practices. This research bridges the gap between advanced machine learning and geotechnical engineering practice, offering a reliable tool for rapid assessment of MSW mechanical properties while maintaining interpretability for engineering decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyang Sun, Yihao Wang, Tao Feng, Dan Zhang, Yifan Zhu, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to streamline the fine-tuning of foundation models, Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have been substantially adopted across various fields, including instruction tuning and domain adaptation. The underlying concept of LoRA involves decomposing a full-rank matrix into the product of two lower-rank matrices, which reduces storage consumption and accelerates the training process. Furthermore, to address the limited expressive capacity of LoRA, the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) has been introduced for incorporating multiple LoRA adapters. The integration of LoRA experts leads to a visible improvement across several downstream scenes. However, the mixture of LoRAs (MoE-LoRA) still exhibits its low robustness during tuning and inferring. Inspired by the Riemannian Preconditioners which train LoRA as a sub-space projector, we propose a new training strategy for MoE-LoRA, to stabilize and boost its feature learning procedure by multi-space projections. Examinations on SGD and AdamW optimizers demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology. Source code is available at https://github.com/THUDM/MoELoRA_Riemannian.</p>

<p>Abstract: There has been difficulty utilising conditional statements as part of the neural network graph (e.g. if input $> x$, pass input to network $N$). This is due to the inability to backpropagate through branching conditions. The Linear Array of Conditions, TOpologies with Separated Error-backpropagation (LACTOSE) Algorithm addresses this issue and allows the conditional use of available machine learning layers for supervised learning models. In this paper, the LACTOSE algorithm is applied to a simple use of DDSP, however, the main point is the development of the "if" conditional for DDSP use. The LACTOSE algorithm stores trained parameters for each user-specified numerical range and loads the parameters dynamically during prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for automating hardware description language (HDL) code generation from high-level natural language instructions. While fine-tuning has improved LLMs' performance in hardware design tasks, prior efforts have largely focused on Verilog generation, overlooking the equally critical task of Verilog understanding. Furthermore, existing models suffer from weak alignment between natural language descriptions and Verilog code, hindering the generation of high-quality, synthesizable designs. To address these issues, we present DeepRTL, a unified representation model that excels in both Verilog understanding and generation. Based on CodeT5+, DeepRTL is fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset that aligns Verilog code with rich, multi-level natural language descriptions. We also introduce the first benchmark for Verilog understanding and take the initiative to apply embedding similarity and GPT Score to evaluate the models' understanding capabilities. These metrics capture semantic similarity more accurately than traditional methods like BLEU and ROUGE, which are limited to surface-level n-gram overlaps. By adapting curriculum learning to train DeepRTL, we enable it to significantly outperform GPT-4 in Verilog understanding tasks, while achieving performance on par with OpenAI's o1-preview model in Verilog generation tasks.</p>

This paper presents a novel OOD detection method that leverages the unique local neuroplasticity property of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons, KANs exhibit local plasticity, allowing them to preserve learned information while adapting to new tasks. Our method compares the activation patterns of a trained KAN against its untrained counterpart to detect OOD samples. We validate our approach on benchmarks from image and medical domains, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art techniques. These results underscore the potential of KANs in enhancing the reliability of machine learning systems in diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liu, Cong Wang, Xingliang Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: The Web of Things (WoT) enhances interoperability across web-based and ubiquitous computing platforms while complementing existing IoT standards. The multimodal Federated Learning (FL) paradigm has been introduced to enhance WoT by enabling the fusion of multi-source mobile sensing data while preserving privacy. However, a key challenge in mobile sensing systems using multimodal FL is modality incompleteness, where some modalities may be unavailable or only partially captured, potentially degrading the system's performance and reliability. Current multimodal FL frameworks typically train multiple unimodal FL subsystems or apply interpolation techniques on the node side to approximate missing modalities. However, these approaches overlook the shared latent feature space among incomplete modalities across different nodes and fail to discriminate against low-quality nodes. To address this gap, we present FedMobile, a new knowledge contribution-aware multimodal FL framework designed for robust learning despite missing modalities. FedMobile prioritizes local-to-global knowledge transfer, leveraging cross-node multimodal feature information to reconstruct missing features. It also enhances system performance and resilience to modality heterogeneity through rigorous node contribution assessments and knowledge contribution-aware aggregation rules. Empirical evaluations on five widely recognized multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedMobile maintains robust learning even when up to 90% of modality information is missing or when data from two modalities are randomly missing, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

Our approach parameterizes reaction paths with a network trained on a loss function that discards tangential energy gradients and enables instant estimation of the transition state. We first validate the method on two-dimensional potentials and then demonstrate its advantages over NEB on challenging atomistic systems where (i) poor initial guesses yield unphysical paths, (ii) multiple competing paths exist, or (iii) the reaction follows a complex multi-step mechanism. Results highlight the versatility of the method -- for instance, a simple adjustment to the sampling strategy during optimization can help escape local-minimum solutions. Finally, in a low-dimensional setting, we demonstrate that a single neural network can learn from existing paths and generalize to unseen systems, showing promise for a universal reaction path representation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15854">Enhancing Domain-Specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Synthetic Data Generation and Evaluation using Reasoning Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Jadon, Avinash Patil, Shashank Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face significant performance gaps when applied to technical domains requiring precise information extraction from complex documents. Current evaluation methodologies relying on document-level metrics inadequately capture token-resolution retrieval accuracy that is critical for domain-related documents. We propose a framework combining granular evaluation metrics with synthetic data generation to optimize domain-specific RAG performance. First, we introduce token-aware metrics Precision $\Omega$ and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) that quantify context preservation versus information density trade-offs inherent in technical texts. Second, we develop a reasoning model-driven pipeline using instruction-tuned LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1 distilled variants, and Phi-4) to generate context-anchored QA pairs with discontinuous reference spans across three specialized corpora: SEC 10-K filings (finance), biomedical abstracts (PubMed), and APT threat reports (cybersecurity).
  Our empirical analysis reveals critical insights: smaller chunks (less than 10 tokens) improve precision by 31-42% (IoU = 0.071 vs. baseline 0.053) at recall costs (-18%), while domain-specific embedding strategies yield 22% variance in optimal chunk sizing (5-20 tokens).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Huang, Junjiao Tian, Brisa Maneechotesuwan, Shivang Chopra, Zsolt Kira</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dorsa Farahmandazad, Kasra Danesh</p>
<p>Abstract: Medicare fraud poses a substantial challenge to healthcare systems, resulting in significant financial losses and undermining the quality of care provided to legitimate beneficiaries. This study investigates the use of machine learning (ML) to enhance Medicare fraud detection, addressing key challenges such as class imbalance, high-dimensional data, and evolving fraud patterns. A dataset comprising inpatient claims, outpatient claims, and beneficiary details was used to train and evaluate five ML models: Random Forest, KNN, LDA, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost. Data preprocessing techniques included resampling SMOTE method to address the class imbalance, feature selection for dimensionality reduction, and aggregation of diagnostic and procedural codes. Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, achieving a training accuracy of 99.2% and validation accuracy of 98.8%, and F1-score (98.4%). The Decision Tree also performed well, achieving a validation accuracy of 96.3%. KNN and AdaBoost demonstrated moderate performance, with validation accuracies of 79.2% and 81.1%, respectively, while LDA struggled with a validation accuracy of 63.3% and a low recall of 16.6%. The results highlight the importance of advanced resampling techniques, feature engineering, and adaptive learning in detecting Medicare fraud effectively. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in addressing the complexities of fraud detection. Future work should explore explainable AI and hybrid models to improve interpretability and performance, ensuring scalable and reliable fraud detection systems that protect healthcare resources and beneficiaries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George H. Chen, Devavrat Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Many modern methods for prediction leverage nearest neighbor search to find past training examples most similar to a test example, an idea that dates back in text to at least the 11th century and has stood the test of time. This monograph aims to explain the success of these methods, both in theory, for which we cover foundational nonasymptotic statistical guarantees on nearest-neighbor-based regression and classification, and in practice, for which we gather prominent methods for approximate nearest neighbor search that have been essential to scaling prediction systems reliant on nearest neighbor analysis to handle massive datasets. Furthermore, we discuss connections to learning distances for use with nearest neighbor methods, including how random decision trees and ensemble methods learn nearest neighbor structure, as well as recent developments in crowdsourcing and graphons.
  In terms of theory, our focus is on nonasymptotic statistical guarantees, which we state in the form of how many training data and what algorithm parameters ensure that a nearest neighbor prediction method achieves a user-specified error tolerance. We begin with the most general of such results for nearest neighbor and related kernel regression and classification in general metric spaces. In such settings in which we assume very little structure, what enables successful prediction is smoothness in the function being estimated for regression, and a low probability of landing near the decision boundary for classification. In practice, these conditions could be difficult to verify for a real dataset. We then cover recent guarantees on nearest neighbor prediction in the three case studies of time series forecasting, recommending products to people over time, and delineating human organs in medical images by looking at image patches. In these case studies, clustering structure enables successful prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Onat Gungor, Amanda Sofie Rios, Nilesh Ahuja, Tajana Rosing</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a fundamental challenge in the deployment of machine learning models. From a security standpoint, this is particularly important because OOD test data can result in misleadingly confident yet erroneous predictions, which undermine the reliability of the deployed model. Although numerous models for OOD detection have been developed in computer vision and language, their adaptability to the time-series data domain remains limited and under-explored. Yet, time-series data is ubiquitous across manufacturing and security applications for which OOD is essential. This paper seeks to address this research gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of modality-agnostic OOD detection algorithms. We evaluate over several multivariate time-series datasets, deep learning architectures, time-series specific data augmentations, and loss functions. Our results demonstrate that: 1) the majority of state-of-the-art OOD methods exhibit limited performance on time-series data, and 2) OOD methods based on deep feature modeling may offer greater advantages for time-series OOD detection, highlighting a promising direction for future time-series OOD detection algorithm development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Chen, Yushi Feng, Changyang He, Yue Deng, Hongxi Pu, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide explainable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and a Distinguisher that examines how well the input texts align with the predicted prompts. We develop and examine two versions of Distinguishers. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that both Distinguishers perform significantly better than the baseline methods, with version2 outperforming baselines by 9.73% on in-distribution data (F1-score) and 12.65% on OOD data (AUROC). Furthermore, a user study is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas A. Gabriel, Neil F. Johnson, George Em Karniadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The relationship between scale transformations and dynamics established by renormalization group techniques is a cornerstone of modern physical theories, from fluid mechanics to elementary particle physics. Integrating renormalization group methods into neural operators for many-body complex systems could provide a foundational inductive bias for learning their effective dynamics, while also uncovering multiscale organization. We introduce a scalable AI framework, ROMA (Renormalized Operators with Multiscale Attention), for learning multiscale evolution operators of many-body complex systems. In particular, we develop a renormalization procedure based on neural analogs of the geometric and laplacian renormalization groups, which can be co-learned with neural operators. An attention mechanism is used to model multiscale interactions by connecting geometric representations of local subgraphs and dynamical operators. We apply this framework in challenging conditions: large systems of more than 1M nodes, long-range interactions, and noisy input-output data for two contrasting examples: Kuramoto oscillators and Burgers-like social dynamics. We demonstrate that the ROMA framework improves scalability and positive transfer between forecasting and effective dynamics tasks compared to state-of-the-art operator learning techniques, while also giving insight into multiscale interactions. Additionally, we investigate power law scaling in the number of model parameters, and demonstrate a departure from typical power law exponents in the presence of hierarchical and multiscale interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Austin Coursey, Marcos Quinones-Grueiro, Gautam Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to control tasks associated with unmanned aerial vehicles and robotics. In recent years, safe RL has been proposed to allow the safe execution of RL algorithms in industrial and mission-critical systems that operate in closed loops. However, if the system operating conditions change, such as when an unknown fault occurs in the system, typical safe RL algorithms are unable to adapt while retaining past knowledge. Continual reinforcement learning algorithms have been proposed to address this issue. However, the impact of continual adaptation on the system's safety is an understudied problem. In this paper, we study the intersection of safe and continual RL. First, we empirically demonstrate that a popular continual RL algorithm, online elastic weight consolidation, is unable to satisfy safety constraints in non-linear systems subject to varying operating conditions. Specifically, we study the MuJoCo HalfCheetah and Ant environments with velocity constraints and sudden joint loss non-stationarity. Then, we show that an agent trained using constrained policy optimization, a safe RL algorithm, experiences catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings. With this in mind, we explore a simple reward-shaping method to ensure that elastic weight consolidation prioritizes remembering both safety and task performance for safety-constrained, non-linear, and non-stationary dynamical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shane Bergsma, Nolan Dey, Gurpreet Gosal, Gavia Gray, Daria Soboleva, Joel Hestness</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are commonly trained with a learning rate (LR) warmup, followed by cosine decay to 10% of the maximum (10x decay). In a large-scale empirical study, we show that under an optimal peak LR, a simple linear decay-to-zero (D2Z) schedule consistently outperforms other schedules when training at compute-optimal dataset sizes. D2Z is superior across a range of model sizes, batch sizes, datasets, and vocabularies. Benefits increase as dataset size increases. Leveraging a novel interpretation of AdamW as an exponential moving average of weight updates, we show how linear D2Z optimally balances the demands of early training (moving away from initial conditions) and late training (averaging over more updates in order to mitigate gradient noise). In experiments, a 610M-parameter model trained for 80 tokens-per-parameter (TPP) using D2Z achieves lower loss than when trained for 200 TPP using 10x decay, corresponding to an astonishing 60% compute savings. Models such as Llama2-7B, trained for 286 TPP with 10x decay, could likely have saved a majority of compute by training with D2Z.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayun Zhang, Shuheng Li, Haiyu Huang, Xiaofan Yu, Rajesh K. Gupta, Jingbo Shang</p>
<p>Abstract: Asynchronous federated learning mitigates the inefficiency of conventional synchronous aggregation by integrating updates as they arrive and adjusting their influence based on staleness. Due to asynchrony and data heterogeneity, learning objectives at the global and local levels are inherently inconsistent -- global optimization trajectories may conflict with ongoing local updates. Existing asynchronous methods simply distribute the latest global weights to clients, which can overwrite local progress and cause model drift. In this paper, we propose OrthoFL, an orthogonal calibration framework that decouples global and local learning progress and adjusts global shifts to minimize interference before merging them into local models. In OrthoFL, clients and the server maintain separate model weights. Upon receiving an update, the server aggregates it into the global weights via a moving average. For client weights, the server computes the global weight shift accumulated during the client's delay and removes the components aligned with the direction of the received update. The resulting parameters lie in a subspace orthogonal to the client update and preserve the maximal information from the global progress. The calibrated global shift is then merged into the client weights for further training. Extensive experiments show that OrthoFL improves accuracy by 9.6% and achieves a 12$\times$ speedup compared to synchronous methods. Moreover, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art asynchronous baselines under various delay patterns and heterogeneity scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lior Belenki, Alekh Agarwal, Tianze Shi, Kristina Toutanova</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method to optimize language model pre-training data mixtures through efficient approximation of the cross-entropy loss corresponding to each candidate mixture via a Mixture of Data Experts (MDE). We use this approximation as a source of additional features in a regression model, trained from observations of model loss for a small number of mixtures.
  Experiments with Transformer decoder-only language models in the range of 70M to 1B parameters on the SlimPajama dataset show that our method achieves significantly better performance than approaches that train regression models using only the mixture rates as input features. Combining this improved optimization method with an objective that takes into account cross-entropy on end task data leads to superior performance on few-shot downstream evaluations.
  We also provide theoretical insights on why aggregation of data expert predictions can provide good approximations to model losses for data mixtures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent works exploring the training dynamics of homogeneous neural network weights under gradient flow with small initialization have established that in the early stages of training, the weights remain small and near the origin, but converge in direction. Building on this, the current paper studies the gradient flow dynamics of homogeneous neural networks with locally Lipschitz gradients, after they escape the origin. Insights gained from this analysis are used to characterize the first saddle point encountered by gradient flow after escaping the origin. Also, it is shown that for homogeneous feed-forward neural networks, under certain conditions, the sparsity structure emerging among the weights before the escape is preserved after escaping the origin and until reaching the next saddle point.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: We study contrastive learning under the PAC learning framework. While a series of recent works have shown statistical results for learning under contrastive loss, based either on the VC-dimension or Rademacher complexity, their algorithms are inherently inefficient or not implying PAC guarantees. In this paper, we consider contrastive learning of the fundamental concept of linear representations. Surprisingly, even under such basic setting, the existence of efficient PAC learners is largely open. We first show that the problem of contrastive PAC learning of linear representations is intractable to solve in general. We then show that it can be relaxed to a semi-definite program when the distance between contrastive samples is measured by the $\ell_2$-norm. We then establish generalization guarantees based on Rademacher complexity, and connect it to PAC guarantees under certain contrastive large-margin conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient PAC learning algorithm for contrastive learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avanika Narayan, Dan Biderman, Sabri Eyuboglu, Avner May, Scott Linderman, James Zou, Christopher Re</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate an emerging setup in which a small, on-device language model (LM) with access to local data communicates with a frontier, cloud-hosted LM to solve real-world tasks involving financial, medical, and scientific reasoning over long documents. Can a local-remote collaboration reduce cloud inference costs while preserving quality? First, we consider a naive collaboration protocol where the local and remote models simply chat back and forth. Because only the local model reads the full context, this protocol achieves a 30.4x reduction in remote costs, but recovers only 87% of the performance of the frontier model. We identify two key limitations of this protocol: the local model struggles to (1) follow the remote model's multi-step instructions and (2) reason over long contexts. Motivated by these observations, we study an extension of this protocol, coined MinionS, in which the remote model decomposes the task into easier subtasks over shorter chunks of the document, that are executed locally in parallel. MinionS reduces costs by 5.7x on average while recovering 97.9% of the performance of the remote model alone. Our analysis reveals several key design choices that influence the trade-off between cost and performance in local-remote systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qisai Liu, Zhanhong Jiang, Hsin-Jung Yang, Mahsa Khosravi, Joshua R. Waite, Soumik Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular state-of-the-art on-policy algorithms that has become a standard baseline in modern reinforcement learning with applications in numerous fields. Though it delivers stable performance with theoretical policy improvement guarantees, high variance, and high sample complexity still remain critical challenges in on-policy algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hybrid-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization (HP3O), which utilizes a trajectory replay buffer to make efficient use of trajectories generated by recent policies. Particularly, the buffer applies the "first in, first out" (FIFO) strategy so as to keep only the recent trajectories to attenuate the data distribution drift. A batch consisting of the trajectory with the best return and other randomly sampled ones from the buffer is used for updating the policy networks. The strategy helps the agent to improve its capability on top of the most recent best performance and in turn reduce variance empirically. We theoretically construct the policy improvement guarantees for the proposed algorithm. HP3O is validated and compared against several baseline algorithms using multiple continuous control environments. Our code is available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rares Cristian, Pavithra Harhsa, Georgia Perakis, Brian Quanz</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical time series forecasting presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with noisy data that may not perfectly adhere to aggregation constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach to soft coherency in hierarchical time series forecasting using neural networks. We present a network coherency regularization method, which we denote as CoRe (Coherency Regularization), a technique that trains neural networks to produce forecasts that are inherently coherent across hierarchies, without strictly enforcing aggregation constraints. Our method offers several key advantages. (1) It provides theoretical guarantees on the coherency of forecasts, even for out-of-sample data. (2) It is adaptable to scenarios where data may contain errors or missing values, making it more robust than strict coherency methods. (3) It can be easily integrated into existing neural network architectures for time series forecasting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets, comparing it against state-of-the-art methods in both coherent and noisy data scenarios. Additionally, our method can be used within existing generative probabilistic forecasting frameworks to generate coherent probabilistic forecasts. Our results show improved generalization and forecast accuracy, particularly in the presence of data inconsistencies. On a variety of datasets, including both strictly hierarchically coherent and noisy data, our training method has either equal or better accuracy at all levels of the hierarchy while being strictly more coherent out-of-sample than existing soft-coherency methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varun Babbar, Hayden McTavish, Cynthia Rudin, Margo Seltzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision tree optimization is fundamental to interpretable machine learning. The most popular approach is to greedily search for the best feature at every decision point, which is fast but provably suboptimal. Recent approaches find the global optimum using branch and bound with dynamic programming, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and sparsity at great cost to scalability. An ideal solution would have the accuracy of an optimal method and the scalability of a greedy method. We introduce a family of algorithms called SPLIT (SParse Lookahead for Interpretable Trees) that moves us significantly forward in achieving this ideal balance. We demonstrate that not all sub-problems need to be solved to optimality to find high quality trees; greediness suffices near the leaves. Since each depth adds an exponential number of possible trees, this change makes our algorithms orders of magnitude faster than existing optimal methods, with negligible loss in performance. We extend this algorithm to allow scalable computation of sets of near-optimal trees (i.e., the Rashomon set).</p>

Our method is formulated as a drop-in replacement for score distillation sampling (SDS), requiring neither model retraining nor extensive modification of the sampling procedure. We show that it exhibits superior mode alignment as well as improved convergence in both synthetic and practical setups, yielding higher-fidelity results when applied to both text-to-image and text-to-3D applications with Stable Diffusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a human-in-the-loop (HIL) approach to permutation regression, the novel task of predicting a continuous value for a given ordering of items. The model is a gradient boosted regression model that incorporates simple human-understandable constraints of the form x < y, i.e. item x has to be before item y, as binary features. The approach, HuGuR (Human Guided Regression), lets a human explore the search space of such transparent regression models. Interacting with HuGuR, users can add, remove, and refine order constraints interactively, while the coefficients are calculated on the fly. We evaluate HuGuR in a user study and compare the performance of user-built models with multiple baselines on 9 data sets. The results show that the user-built models outperform the compared methods on small data sets and in general perform on par with the other methods, while being in principle understandable for humans. On larger datasets from the same domain, machine-induced models begin to outperform the user-built models. Further work will study the trust users have in models when constructed by themselves and how the scheme can be transferred to other pattern domains, such as strings, sequences, trees, or graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper goes into depth on the effect that US News Sentiment from national newspapers has on US interstate migration trends. Through harnessing data from the New York Times between 2010 and 2020, an average sentiment score was calculated, allowing for data to be entered into a neural network. Then a logistic regression model was used to predict interstate migration. The results indicate the model was highly accurate as the mean margin of error was +/- 900 citizens. The predictions from the model were compared with the US Census data from 2010 to 2020 that was used to train the model. Since the input for the model was not exposed to any migration data, the model clearly demonstrated that its results were drawn from sentiment data alone. These findings are significant as they indicate that the role of the press could be used as a predictor for domestic migration which can help the government and businesses understand better what is influencing people to move to certain places.</p>

We show that the inclusion of hierarchical residuals in several architectures, including ResNets, results in a boost in accuracy and faster learning. A detailed analysis of our models reveals that they perform hierarchical compositionality by learning feature maps relative to the compressed representations provided by the skip connections.</p>

To this end, we introduce a stable topological invariant that captures both static and dynamic features at different scales. We present an algorithm to compute this invariant efficiently.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheling Tan, Kexin Ding, Jin Gao, Mu Zhou, Dimitris Metaxas, Shaoting Zhang, Dequan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundational models (FMs) have made significant strides in the healthcare domain. Yet the data silo challenge and privacy concern remain in healthcare systems, hindering safe medical data sharing and collaborative model development among institutions. The collection and curation of scalable clinical datasets increasingly become the bottleneck for training strong FMs. In this study, we propose Medical Foundation Models Merging (MedForge), a cooperative framework enabling a community-driven medical foundation model development, meanwhile preventing the information leakage of raw patient data and mitigating synchronization model development issues across clinical institutions. MedForge offers a bottom-up model construction mechanism by flexibly merging task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules, which can adapt to downstream tasks while retaining original model parameters. Through an asynchronous LoRA module integration scheme, the resulting composite model can progressively enhance its comprehensive performance on various clinical tasks. MedForge shows strong performance on multiple clinical datasets (e.g., breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer) collected from different institutions. Our major findings highlight the value of collaborative foundation models in advancing multi-center clinical collaboration effectively and cohesively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mateusz Olko, Mateusz Gajewski, Joanna Wojciechowska, Miko{\l}aj Morzy, Piotr Sankowski, Piotr Mi{\l}o\'s</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural causal discovery methods have recently improved in terms of scalability and computational efficiency. However, our systematic evaluation highlights significant room for improvement in their accuracy when uncovering causal structures. We identify a fundamental limitation: neural networks cannot reliably distinguish between existing and non-existing causal relationships in the finite sample regime. Our experiments reveal that neural networks, as used in contemporary causal discovery approaches, lack the precision needed to recover ground-truth graphs, even for small graphs and relatively large sample sizes. Furthermore, we identify the faithfulness property as a critical bottleneck: (i) it is likely to be violated across any reasonable dataset size range, and (ii) its violation directly undermines the performance of neural discovery methods. These findings lead us to conclude that progress within the current paradigm is fundamentally constrained, necessitating a paradigm shift in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jathurshan Pradeepkumar, Xihao Piao, Zheng Chen, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework tailored for EEG analysis that transforms continuous, noisy brain signals into a sequence of discrete, well-represented tokens for various EEG tasks. Conventional approaches typically rely on continuous embeddings and inter-channel dependencies, which are limited in capturing inherent EEG features such as temporally unpredictable patterns and diverse oscillatory waveforms. In contrast, we hypothesize that critical time-frequency features can be effectively captured from a single channel. By learning tokens that encapsulate these intrinsic patterns within a single channel, our approach yields a scalable tokenizer adaptable across diverse EEG settings. We integrate the TFM-Tokenizer with a transformer-based TFM-Encoder, leveraging established pretraining techniques from natural language processing, such as masked token prediction, followed by downstream fine-tuning for various EEG tasks. Experiments across four EEG datasets show that TFM-Token outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On TUEV, our approach improves balanced accuracy and Cohen's Kappa by 5% over baselines. Comprehensive analysis of the learned tokens demonstrates their ability to capture class-distinctive features, enhance frequency representation, and ability to encode time-frequency motifs into distinct tokens, improving interpretability.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16064">Single Domain Generalization with Model-aware Parametric Batch-wise Mixup</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marzi Heidari, Yuhong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) remains a formidable challenge in the field of machine learning, particularly when models are deployed in environments that differ significantly from their training domains. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach, named as Model-aware Parametric Batch-wise Mixup (MPBM), to tackle the challenge of SDG. MPBM deploys adversarial queries generated with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and produces model-aware augmenting instances with a parametric batch-wise mixup generator network that is carefully designed through an innovative attention mechanism. By exploiting inter-feature correlations, the parameterized mixup generator introduces additional versatility in combining features across a batch of instances, thereby enhancing the capacity to generate highly adaptive and informative synthetic instances for specific queries. The synthetic data produced by this adaptable generator network, guided by informative queries, is expected to significantly enrich the representation space covered by the original training dataset and subsequently enhance the prediction model's generalizability across diverse and previously unseen domains. To prevent excessive deviation from the training data, we further incorporate a real-data alignment-based adversarial loss into the learning process of MPBM, regularizing any tendencies toward undesirable expansions. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that by augmenting the training set with informative synthesis data, our proposed MPBM method achieves the state-of-the-art performance for single domain generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Cai, Kangjie Zhou, Jingfeng Wu, Song Mei, Michael Lindsey, Peter L. Bartlett</p>
<p>Abstract: We establish the asymptotic implicit bias of gradient descent (GD) for generic non-homogeneous deep networks under exponential loss. Specifically, we characterize three key properties of GD iterates starting from a sufficiently small empirical risk, where the threshold is determined by a measure of the network's non-homogeneity. First, we show that a normalized margin induced by the GD iterates increases nearly monotonically. Second, we prove that while the norm of the GD iterates diverges to infinity, the iterates themselves converge in direction. Finally, we establish that this directional limit satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem. Prior works on implicit bias have focused exclusively on homogeneous networks; in contrast, our results apply to a broad class of non-homogeneous networks satisfying a mild near-homogeneity condition. In particular, our results apply to networks with residual connections and non-homogeneous activation functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed by Ji and Telgarsky (2020).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenzhi Yang, Junbo Zhao, Shouqing Yang, Yixuan Li, Dingyu Yang, Xiaofang Zhang, Haobo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes in the graph-based machine-learning field is challenging, particularly when in-distribution (ID) node multi-category labels are unavailable. Thus, we focus on feature space rather than label space and find that, ideally, during the optimization of known ID samples, unknown ID samples undergo more significant representation changes than OOD samples, even if the model is trained to fit random targets, which we called the Feature Resonance phenomenon. The rationale behind it is that even without gold labels, the local manifold may still exhibit smooth resonance. Based on this, we further develop a novel graph OOD framework, dubbed Resonance-based Separation and Learning (RSL), which comprises two core modules: (i) a more practical micro-level proxy of feature resonance that measures the movement of feature vectors in one training step. (ii) integrate with synthetic OOD nodes strategy to train an effective OOD classifier. Theoretically, we derive an error bound showing the superior separability of OOD nodes during the resonance period. Empirically, RSL achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the FPR95 metric by an average of 18.51% across five real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Cheng, Xiaoyu Xia, Hong Wang, Minghui Liwang, Ning Chen, Xuwei Fan, Xianbin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge inference (EI) is a key solution to address the growing challenges of delayed response times, limited scalability, and privacy concerns in cloud-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference. However, deploying DNN models on resource-constrained edge devices faces more severe challenges, such as model storage limitations, dynamic service requests, and privacy risks. This paper proposes a novel framework for privacy-aware joint DNN model deployment and partition optimization to minimize long-term average inference delay under resource and privacy constraints. Specifically, the problem is formulated as a complex optimization problem considering model deployment, user-server association, and model partition strategies. To handle the NP-hardness and future uncertainties, a Lyapunov-based approach is introduced to transform the long-term optimization into a single-time-slot problem, ensuring system performance. Additionally, a coalition formation game model is proposed for edge server association, and a greedy-based algorithm is developed for model deployment within each coalition to efficiently solve the problem. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms effectively reduce inference delay while satisfying privacy constraints, outperforming baseline approaches in various scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanxuan Wang, Na Lu, Xueying Zhao, Yuxuan Yan, Kaipeng Ma, Kwoh Chee Keong, Gustavo Carneiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning from noisy labels (LNL) aims to train high-performance deep models using noisy datasets. Meta learning based label correction methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in LNL by designing various meta label rectification tasks. However, extra clean validation set is a prerequisite for these methods to perform label correction, requiring extra labor and greatly limiting their practicality. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel noisy meta label correction framework STCT, which counterintuitively uses noisy data to correct label noise, borrowing the spirit in the saying ``Set a Thief to Catch a Thief''. The core idea of STCT is to leverage noisy data which is i.i.d. with the training data as a validation set to evaluate model performance and perform label correction in a meta learning framework, eliminating the need for extra clean data. By decoupling the complex bi-level optimization in meta learning into representation learning and label correction, STCT is solved through an alternating training strategy between noisy meta correction and semi-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of STCT, particularly in high noise rate scenarios. STCT achieves 96.9% label correction and 95.2% classification performance on CIFAR-10 with 80% symmetric noise, significantly surpassing the current state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Gao, Zhuolin He, Jian Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: To deploy machine learning models in the real world, researchers have proposed many OOD detection algorithms to help models identify unknown samples during the inference phase and prevent them from making untrustworthy predictions. Unlike methods that rely on extra data for outlier exposure training, post hoc methods detect Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples by developing scoring functions, which are model agnostic and do not require additional training. However, previous post hoc methods may fail to capture the geometric cues embedded in network representations. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel score function based on the optimal transport theory, named OTOD, for OOD detection. We utilize information from features, logits, and the softmax probability space to calculate the OOD score for each test sample. Our experiments show that combining this information can boost the performance of OTOD with a certain margin. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Notably, OTOD outperforms the state-of-the-art method GEN by 7.19% in the mean FPR@95 on the CIFAR-10 benchmark using ResNet-18 as the backbone, and by 12.51% in the mean FPR@95 using WideResNet-28 as the backbone. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantees for OTOD. The code is available in https://github.com/HengGao12/OTOD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksej Cornelissen, Jie Shi, Siamak Mehrkanoon</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, data-driven, deep learning-based approaches for precipitation nowcasting have attracted significant attention, showing promising results. However, many existing models fail to fully exploit the extensive atmospheric information available, relying primarily on precipitation data alone. This study introduces two novel deep learning architectures, SmaAt-fUsion and SmaAt-Krige-GNet, specifically designed to enhance precipitation nowcasting by integrating multi-variable weather station data with radar datasets. By leveraging additional meteorological information, these models improve representation learning in the latent space, resulting in enhanced nowcasting performance. The SmaAt-fUsion model extends the SmaAt-UNet framework by incorporating weather station data through a convolutional layer, integrating it into the bottleneck of the network. Conversely, the SmaAt-Krige-GNet model combines precipitation maps with weather station data processed using Kriging, a geo-statistical interpolation method, to generate variable-specific maps. These maps are then utilized in a dual-encoder architecture based on SmaAt-GNet, allowing multi-level data integration. Experimental evaluations were conducted using four years (2016--2019) of weather station and precipitation radar data from the Netherlands. Results demonstrate that SmaAt-Krige-GNet outperforms the standard SmaAt-UNet, which relies solely on precipitation radar data, in low precipitation scenarios, while SmaAt-fUsion surpasses SmaAt-UNet in both low and high precipitation scenarios. This highlights the potential of incorporating discrete weather station data to enhance the performance of deep learning-based weather nowcasting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fucheng Guo, Zeyu Luan, Qing Li, Dan Zhao, Yong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an essential framework for distributed machine learning, especially with its potential for privacy-preserving data processing. However, existing FL frameworks struggle to address statistical and model heterogeneity, which severely impacts model performance. While Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) introduces prototype-based strategies to address the challenges, current approaches face limitations in achieving optimal separation of prototypes. This paper presents FedOC, a novel HtFL algorithm designed to improve global prototype separation through orthogonality constraints, which not only increase intra-class prototype similarity but also significantly expand the inter-class angular separation. With the guidance of the global prototype, each client keeps its embeddings aligned with the corresponding prototype in the feature space, promoting directional independence that integrates seamlessly with the cross-entropy (CE) loss. We provide theoretical proof of FedOC's convergence under non-convex conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOC outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 10.12% accuracy improvement in both statistical and model heterogeneity settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirmahdi Mirfakhar, Xuchuang Wang, Jinhang Zuo, Yair Zick, Mohammad Hajiesmaili</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a hinted heterogeneous multi-agent multi-armed bandits problem (HMA2B), where agents can query low-cost observations (hints) in addition to pulling arms. In this framework, each of the $M$ agents has a unique reward distribution over $K$ arms, and in $T$ rounds, they can observe the reward of the arm they pull only if no other agent pulls that arm. The goal is to maximize the total utility by querying the minimal necessary hints without pulling arms, achieving time-independent regret. We study HMA2B in both centralized and decentralized setups. Our main centralized algorithm, GP-HCLA, which is an extension of HCLA, uses a central decision-maker for arm-pulling and hint queries, achieving $O(M^4K)$ regret with $O(MK\log T)$ adaptive hints. In decentralized setups, we propose two algorithms, HD-ETC and EBHD-ETC, that allow agents to choose actions independently through collision-based communication and query hints uniformly until stopping, yielding $O(M^3K^2)$ regret with $O(M^3K\log T)$ hints, where the former requires knowledge of the minimum gap and the latter does not. Finally, we establish lower bounds to prove the optimality of our results and verify them through numerical simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kieu Thao Nguyen Pham, Rachael Hwee Ling Sim, Quoc Phong Nguyen, See Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Data valuation is increasingly used in machine learning (ML) to decide the fair compensation for data owners and identify valuable or harmful data for improving ML models. Cooperative game theory-based data valuation, such as Data Shapley, requires evaluating the data utility (e.g., validation accuracy) and retraining the ML model for multiple data subsets. While most existing works on efficient estimation of the Shapley values have focused on reducing the number of subsets to evaluate, our framework, \texttt{DUPRE}, takes an alternative yet complementary approach that reduces the cost per subset evaluation by predicting data utilities instead of evaluating them by model retraining. Specifically, given the evaluated data utilities of some data subsets, \texttt{DUPRE} fits a \emph{Gaussian process} (GP) regression model to predict the utility of every other data subset. Our key contribution lies in the design of our GP kernel based on the sliced Wasserstein distance between empirical data distributions. In particular, we show that the kernel is valid and positive semi-definite, encodes prior knowledge of similarities between different data subsets, and can be efficiently computed. We empirically verify that \texttt{DUPRE} introduces low prediction error and speeds up data valuation for various ML models, datasets, and utility functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anantram Patel, Vijay Kumar Sutrakar</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches for fake news detection (FND) often depend on auxiliary, non-textual data such as user interaction histories or content dissemination patterns. However, these data sources are not always accessible, limiting the effectiveness and applicability of such methods. Additionally, existing models frequently struggle to capture the detailed and intricate relationships within textual information, reducing their overall accuracy. In order to address these challenges Advanced Text Analysis Graph Neural Network (ATA-GNN) is proposed in this paper. The proposed model is designed to operate solely on textual data. ATA-GNN employs innovative topic modelling (clustering) techniques to identify typical words for each topic, leveraging multiple clustering dimensions to achieve a comprehensive semantic understanding of the text. This multi-layered design enables the model to uncover intricate textual patterns while contextualizing them within a broader semantic framework, significantly enhancing its interpretative capabilities. Extensive evaluations on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that ATA-GNN surpasses the performance of current GNN-based FND methods. These findings validate the potential of integrating advanced text clustering within GNN architectures to achieve more reliable and text-focused detection solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have shown promise in solving routing problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) without handcrafted designs. Research in this domain has explored two primary categories of methods: iterative and non-iterative. While non-iterative methods struggle to generate near-optimal solutions directly, iterative methods simplify the task by learning local search steps. However, existing iterative methods are often limited by restricted neighborhood searches, leading to suboptimal results. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that extends the search to larger neighborhoods by learning a destroy-and-repair strategy. Specifically, we introduce a Destroy-and-Repair framework based on Hyper-Graphs (DRHG). This framework reduces consecutive intact edges to hyper-edges, allowing the model to pay more attention to the destroyed part and decrease the complexity of encoding all nodes. Experiments demonstrate that DRHG achieves stateof-the-art performance on TSP with up to 10,000 nodes and shows strong generalization to real-world TSPLib and CVRPLib problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maciej Chrab\k{a}szcz, Filip Szatkowski, Bartosz W\'ojcik, Jan Dubi\'nski, Tomasz Trzci\'nski</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the safety of the Large Language Model (LLM) is critical, but currently used methods in most cases sacrifice the model performance to obtain increased safety or perform poorly on data outside of their adaptation distribution. We investigate existing methods for such generalization and find them insufficient. Surprisingly, while even plain LLMs recognize unsafe prompts, they may still generate unsafe responses. To avoid performance degradation and preserve safe performance, we advocate for a two-step framework, where we first identify unsafe prompts via a lightweight classifier, and apply a "safe" model only to such prompts. In particular, we explore the design of the safety detector in more detail, investigating the use of different classifier architectures and prompting techniques. Interestingly, we find that the final hidden state for the last token is enough to provide robust performance, minimizing false positives on benign data while performing well on malicious prompt detection. Additionally, we show that classifiers trained on the representations from different model layers perform comparably on the latest model layers, indicating that safety representation is present in the LLMs' hidden states at most model stages. Our work is a step towards efficient, representation-based safety mechanisms for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sayedmohammadreza Rastegari, Sina Tabakhi, Xianyuan Liu, Wei Sang, Haiping Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: In computational structural biology, predicting metal-binding sites and their corresponding metal types is challenging due to the complexity of protein structures and interactions. Conventional sequence- and structure-based prediction approaches cannot capture the complex evolutionary relationships driving these interactions to facilitate understanding, while recent co-evolution-based approaches do not fully consider the entire structure of the co-evolved residue network. In this paper, we introduce MBGNN (Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network) that utilizes the entire co-evolved residue network and effectively captures the complex dependencies within protein structures via graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of co-evolved metal-binding residues and their associated metal types. Experimental results on a public dataset show that MBGNN outperforms existing co-evolution-based metal-binding prediction methods, and it is also competitive against recent sequence-based methods, showing the potential of integrating co-evolutionary insights with advanced machine learning to deepen our understanding of protein-metal interactions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asiri Wijesinghe, Hao Zhu, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSSL) struggles to capture complex structural properties well. This limitation stems from two main factors: (1) the inadequacy of conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in representing sophisticated topological features, and (2) the focus of self-supervised learning solely on final graph representations. To address these issues, we introduce \emph{GenHopNet}, a GNN framework that integrates a $k$-hop message-passing scheme, enhancing its ability to capture local structural information without explicit substructure extraction. We theoretically demonstrate that \emph{GenHopNet} surpasses the expressiveness of the classical Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism. Furthermore, we propose a structural- and positional-aware GSSL framework that incorporates topological information throughout the learning process. This approach enables the learning of representations that are both sensitive to graph topology and invariant to specific structural and feature augmentations. Comprehensive experiments on graph classification datasets, including those designed to test structural sensitivity, show that our method consistently outperforms the existing approaches and maintains computational efficiency. Our work significantly advances GSSL's capability in distinguishing graphs with similar local structures but different global topologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arshia Afzal, Elias Abad Rocamora, Leyla Naz Candogan, Pol Puigdemont, Francesco Tonin, Yongtao Wu, Mahsa Shoaran, Volkan Cevher</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers with linear attention enable fast and parallel training. Moreover, they can be formulated as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for efficient linear-time inference. While extensively evaluated in causal sequence modeling, they have yet to be extended to the bidirectional setting. This work introduces the LION framework, establishing new theoretical foundations for linear transformers in bidirectional sequence modeling. LION constructs a bidirectional RNN equivalent to full Linear Attention. This extends the benefits of linear transformers: parallel training, and efficient inference, into the bidirectional setting. Using LION, we cast three linear transformers to their bidirectional form: LION-LIT, the bidirectional variant corresponding to (Katharopoulos et al., 2020); LION-D, extending RetNet (Sun et al., 2023); and LION-S, a linear transformer with a stable selective mask inspired by selectivity of SSMs (Dao & Gu, 2024). Replacing the attention block with LION (-LIT, -D, -S) achieves performance on bidirectional tasks that approaches that of Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs), while delivering significant improvements in training speed. Our implementation is available in http://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/LION.</p>

<p>Abstract: We revisit the problem of fair representation learning by proposing Fair Partial Least Squares (PLS) components. PLS is widely used in statistics to efficiently reduce the dimension of the data by providing representation tailored for the prediction. We propose a novel method to incorporate fairness constraints in the construction of PLS components. This new algorithm provides a feasible way to construct such features both in the linear and the non linear case using kernel embeddings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah Ball, Simeon Allmendinger, Frauke Kreuter, Niklas K\"uhl</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is increasingly used in survey contexts to simulate human preferences. While many research endeavors evaluate the quality of synthetic GenAI data by comparing model-generated responses to gold-standard survey results, fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of using LLMs as substitutes for human respondents remain. Our study provides a technical analysis of how demographic attributes and prompt variations influence latent opinion mappings in large language models (LLMs) and evaluates their suitability for survey-based predictions. Using 14 different models, we find that LLM-generated data fails to replicate the variance observed in real-world human responses, particularly across demographic subgroups. In the political space, persona-to-party mappings exhibit limited differentiation, resulting in synthetic data that lacks the nuanced distribution of opinions found in survey data. Moreover, we show that prompt sensitivity can significantly alter outputs for some models, further undermining the stability and predictiveness of LLM-based simulations. As a key contribution, we adapt a probe-based methodology that reveals how LLMs encode political affiliations in their latent space, exposing the systematic distortions introduced by these models. Our findings highlight critical limitations in AI-generated survey data, urging caution in its use for public opinion research, social science experimentation, and computational behavioral modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuqi Mao, Zhenying He, X. Sean Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state of the art for a variety of graph-related tasks and have been widely used in Heterogeneous Graphs (HetGs), where meta-paths help encode specific semantics between various node types. Despite the revolutionary representation capabilities of existing heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) due to their focus on improving the effectiveness of heterogeneity capturing, the huge training costs hinder their practical deployment in real-world scenarios that frequently require handling ad-hoc queries with user-defined meta-paths. To address this, we propose FHGE, a Fast Heterogeneous Graph Embedding designed for efficient, retraining-free generation of meta-path-guided graph embeddings. The key design of the proposed framework is two-fold: segmentation and reconstruction modules. It employs Meta-Path Units (MPUs) to segment the graph into local and global components, enabling swift integration of node embeddings from relevant MPUs during reconstruction and allowing quick adaptation to specific meta-paths. In addition, a dual attention mechanism is applied to enhance semantics capturing. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FHGE in generating meta-path-guided graph embeddings and downstream tasks, such as link prediction and node classification, highlighting its significant advantages for real-time graph analysis in ad-hoc queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megan Tjandrasuwita, Chanakya Ekbote, Liu Ziyin, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal representation learning is fundamentally about transforming incomparable modalities into comparable representations. While prior research primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or, in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang Wang, Shaozhen Liu, Yu Rong, Deli Zhao, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Establishing the relationship between 3D structures and the energy states of molecular systems has proven to be a promising approach for learning 3D molecular representations. However, existing methods are limited to modeling the molecular energy states from classical mechanics. This limitation results in a significant oversight of quantum mechanical effects, such as quantized (discrete) energy level structures, which offer a more accurate estimation of molecular energy and can be experimentally measured through energy spectra. In this paper, we propose to utilize the energy spectra to enhance the pre-training of 3D molecular representations (MolSpectra), thereby infusing the knowledge of quantum mechanics into the molecular representations. Specifically, we propose SpecFormer, a multi-spectrum encoder for encoding molecular spectra via masked patch reconstruction. By further aligning outputs from the 3D encoder and spectrum encoder using a contrastive objective, we enhance the 3D encoder's understanding of molecules. Evaluations on public benchmarks reveal that our pre-trained representations surpass existing methods in predicting molecular properties and modeling dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuqi Mao, Zhenyi Chen, Zhenying He, Yinan Jing, Kai Zhang, X. Sean Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerous real-world information networks form Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) with diverse objects and relations represented as nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs. Similarity between nodes quantifies how closely two nodes resemble each other, mainly depending on the similarity of the nodes they are connected to, recursively. Users may be interested in only specific types of connections in the similarity definition, represented as meta-paths, i.e., a sequence of node and edge types. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN)-based similarity search methods may accommodate meta-paths, but require retraining for different meta-paths. Conversely, existing path-based similarity search methods may switch flexibly between meta-paths but often suffer from lower accuracy, as they rely solely on path information. This paper proposes HetFS, a Fast Similarity method for ad-hoc queries with user-given meta-paths on Heterogeneous information networks. HetFS provides similarity results based on path information that satisfies the meta-path restriction, as well as node content. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HetFS in addressing ad-hoc queries, outperforming state-of-the-art HGNNs and path-based approaches, and showing strong performance in downstream applications, including link prediction, node classification, and clustering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ege Onur Taga, M. Emrullah Ildiz, Samet Oymak</p>
<p>Abstract: The diversity of time series applications and scarcity of domain-specific data highlight the need for time-series models with strong few-shot learning capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel training scheme and a transformer-based architecture, collectively referred to as TimePFN, for multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting. TimePFN is based on the concept of Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFN), which aims to approximate Bayesian inference. Our approach consists of (1) generating synthetic MTS data through diverse Gaussian process kernels and the linear coregionalization method, and (2) a novel MTS architecture capable of utilizing both temporal and cross-channel dependencies across all input patches. We evaluate TimePFN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models for MTS forecasting in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Notably, fine-tuning TimePFN with as few as 500 data points nearly matches full dataset training error, and even 50 data points yield competitive results. We also find that TimePFN exhibits strong univariate forecasting performance, attesting to its generalization ability. Overall, this work unlocks the power of synthetic data priors for MTS forecasting and facilitates strong zero- and few-shot forecasting performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mira J\"urgens, Thomas Mortier, Eyke H\"ullermeier, Viktor Bengs, Willem Waegeman</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate representation of epistemic uncertainty is a challenging yet essential task in machine learning. A widely used representation corresponds to convex sets of probabilistic predictors, also known as credal sets. One popular way of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized supervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified through measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In principle, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As a necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of calibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to determine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that is calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework allows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that different ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the input space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules, which inherently optimize for calibration. Building on differentiable, kernel-based estimators of calibration errors, we introduce a nonparametric testing procedure and demonstrate the benefits of capturing instance-level variability on of synthetic and real-world experiments.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16324">Deep Time Warping for Multiple Time Series Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Nourbakhsh, Hoda Mohammadzade</p>
<p>Abstract: Time Series Alignment is a critical task in signal processing with numerous real-world applications. In practice, signals often exhibit temporal shifts and scaling, making classification on raw data prone to errors. This paper introduces a novel approach for Multiple Time Series Alignment (MTSA) leveraging Deep Learning techniques. While most existing methods primarily address Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) for protein and DNA sequences, there remains a significant gap in alignment methodologies for numerical time series. Additionally, conventional approaches typically focus on pairwise alignment, whereas our proposed method aligns all signals in a multiple manner (all the signals are aligned together at once). This innovation not only enhances alignment efficiency but also significantly improves computational speed. By decomposing into piece-wise linear sections, we introduce varying levels of complexity into the warping function. Additionally, our method ensures the satisfaction of three warping constraints: boundary, monotonicity, and continuity conditions. The utilization of a deep convolutional network allows us to employ a new loss function, addressing some limitations of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Experimental results on the UCR Archive 2018, comprising 129 time series datasets, demonstrate that employing our approach to align signals significantly enhances classification accuracy and warping average and also reduces the run time across the majority of these datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The primary goal of reinforcement learning is to develop decision-making policies that prioritize optimal performance, frequently without considering risk or safety. In contrast, safe reinforcement learning seeks to reduce or avoid unsafe states. This letter introduces a risk-averse temporal difference algorithm that uses optimal transport theory to direct the agent toward predictable behavior. By incorporating a risk indicator, the agent learns to favor actions with predictable consequences. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in several case studies and show its effectiveness in the presence of uncertainty. The results demonstrate that our method reduces the frequency of visits to risky states while preserving performance. A Python implementation of the algorithm is available at https:// github.com/SAILRIT/Risk-averse-TD-Learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Failure of machine learning models to generalize to new data is a core problem limiting the reliability of AI systems, partly due to the lack of simple and robust methods for comparing new data to the original training dataset. We propose a standardized approach for assessing data similarity in a model-agnostic manner by constructing a supervised autoencoder for generalizability estimation (SAGE). We compare points in a low-dimensional embedded latent space, defining empirical probability measures for k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) distance, reconstruction of inputs and task-based performance. As proof of concept for classification tasks, we use MNIST and CIFAR-10 to demonstrate how an ensemble output probability score can separate deformed images from a mixture of typical test examples, and how this SAGE score is robust to transformations of increasing severity. As further proof of concept, we extend this approach to a regression task using non-imaging data (UCI Abalone). In all cases, we show that out-of-the-box model performance increases after SAGE score filtering, even when applied to data from the model's own training and test datasets. Our out-of-distribution scoring method can be introduced during several steps of model construction and assessment, leading to future improvements in responsible deep learning implementation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent works have characterized the function-space inductive bias of infinite-width bounded-norm single-hidden-layer neural networks as a kind of bounded-variation-type space. This novel neural network Banach space encompasses many classical multivariate function spaces including certain Sobolev spaces and the spectral Barron spaces. Notably, this Banach space also includes functions that exhibit less classical regularity such as those that only vary in a few directions. On bounded domains, it is well-established that the Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) strictly embeds into this Banach space, demonstrating a clear gap between the Gaussian RKHS and the neural network Banach space. It turns out that when investigating these spaces on unbounded domains, e.g., all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the story is fundamentally different. We establish the following fundamental result: Certain functions that lie in the Gaussian RKHS have infinite norm in the neural network Banach space. This provides a nontrivial gap between kernel methods and neural networks by the exhibition of functions in which kernel methods can do strictly better than neural networks.</p>

Reinforcement learning is experiencing a resurgence of interest due to its association with the fine-tuning of language models from human feedback. Tool-chain language models control task-specific agents; if the converse has not already appeared, it soon will. In this paper, we present what we believe is the first investigation of an intelligent trading agent based on continuous deep reinforcement learning that also controls a large language model with which it can post to a social media feed observed by other traders. We empirically investigate the performance and impact of such an agent in a simulated financial market, finding that it learns to optimize its total reward, and thereby augment its profit, by manipulating the sentiment of the posts it produces.

<p>Abstract: Cloud computing adoption across industries has revolutionized enterprise operations while introducing significant challenges in compliance management. Organizations must continuously meet evolving regulatory requirements such as GDPR and ISO 27001, yet traditional manual review processes have become increasingly inadequate for modern business scales. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based framework for automating cloud computing compliance processes, addressing critical challenges including resource-intensive manual reviews, extended compliance cycles, and delayed risk identification. Our proposed framework integrates multiple machine learning technologies, including BERT-based document processing (94.5% accuracy), One-Class SVM for anomaly detection (88.7% accuracy), and an improved CNN-LSTM architecture for sequential compliance data analysis (90.2% accuracy). Implementation results demonstrate significant improvements: reducing compliance process duration from 7 days to 1.5 days, improving accuracy from 78% to 93%, and decreasing manual effort by 73.3%. A real-world deployment at a major securities firm validated these results, processing 800,000 daily transactions with 94.2% accuracy in risk identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddharth Bhandari, Liren Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the multi-party classification problem introduced by Dong, Hartline, and Vijayaraghavan (2022) motivated by electronic discovery. In this problem, our goal is to design a protocol that guarantees the requesting party receives nearly all responsive documents while minimizing the disclosure of nonresponsive documents. We develop verification protocols that certify the correctness of a classifier by disclosing a few nonresponsive documents.
  We introduce a combinatorial notion called the Leave-One-Out dimension of a family of classifiers and show that the number of nonresponsive documents disclosed by our protocol is at most this dimension in the realizable setting, where a perfect classifier exists in this family. For linear classifiers with a margin, we characterize the trade-off between the margin and the number of nonresponsive documents that must be disclosed for verification. Specifically, we establish a trichotomy in this requirement: for $d$ dimensional instances, when the margin exceeds $1/3$, verification can be achieved by revealing only $O(1)$ nonresponsive documents; when the margin is exactly $1/3$, in the worst case, at least $\Omega(d)$ nonresponsive documents must be disclosed; when the margin is smaller than $1/3$, verification requires $\Omega(e^d)$ nonresponsive documents. We believe this result is of independent interest with applications to coding theory and combinatorial geometry. We further extend our protocols to the nonrealizable setting defining an analogous combinatorial quantity robust Leave-One-Out dimension, and to scenarios where the protocol is tolerant to misclassification errors by Alice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are designed to predict outcomes using features about an individual, but fail to take into account how individuals can change them. Consequently, models can assign fixed predictions that deny individuals recourse to change their outcome. This work develops a new paradigm to identify fixed predictions by finding confined regions in which all individuals receive fixed predictions. We introduce the first method, ReVer, for this task, using tools from mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming. Our approach certifies recourse for out-of-sample data, provides interpretable descriptions of confined regions, and runs in seconds on real world datasets. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of confined regions across diverse applications. Our results highlight that existing point-wise verification methods fail to discover confined regions, while ReVer provably succeeds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung Nguyen, Yan Leng</p>
<p>Abstract: Linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of LLMs. Park et al. (2024) formalize this notion by unifying multiple interpretations of linear representation, such as 1-dimensional subspace representation and interventions, using a causal inner product. However, their framework relies on single-token counterfactual pairs and cannot handle ambiguous contrasting pairs, limiting its applicability to complex or context-dependent concepts. We introduce a new notion of binary concepts as unit vectors in a canonical representation space, and utilize LLMs' (neural) activation differences along with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to compute concept directions (i.e., steering vectors). Our method, Sum of Activation-base Normalized Difference (SAND), formalizes the use of activation differences modeled as samples from a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, providing a principled approach to derive concept directions. We extend the applicability of Park et al. (2024) by eliminating the dependency on unembedding representations and single-token pairs. Through experiments with LLaMA models across diverse concepts and benchmarks, we demonstrate that our lightweight approach offers greater flexibility, superior performance in activation engineering tasks like monitoring and manipulation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16387">Simultaneous Swap Regret Minimization via KL-Calibration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haipeng Luo, Spandan Senapati, Vatsal Sharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Calibration is a fundamental concept that aims at ensuring the reliability of probabilistic predictions by aligning them with real-world outcomes. There is a surge of studies on new calibration measures that are easier to optimize compared to the classical $\ell_1$-Calibration while still having strong implications for downstream applications. One recent such example is the work by Fishelson et al. (2025) who show that it is possible to achieve $O(T^{1/3})$ pseudo $\ell_2$-Calibration error via minimizing pseudo swap regret of the squared loss, which in fact implies the same bound for all bounded proper losses with a smooth univariate form. In this work, we significantly generalize their result in the following ways: (a) in addition to smooth univariate forms, our algorithm also simultaneously achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ swap regret for any proper loss with a twice continuously differentiable univariate form (such as Tsallis entropy); (b) our bounds hold not only for pseudo swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's distributions on predictions, but also hold for the actual swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's actual realized predictions.
  We achieve so by introducing a new stronger notion of calibration called (pseudo) KL-Calibration, which we show is equivalent to the (pseudo) swap regret for log loss. We prove that there exists an algorithm that achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ KL-Calibration error and provide an explicit algorithm that achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ pseudo KL-Calibration error. Moreover, we show that the same algorithm achieves $O(T^{1/3}(\log T)^{-1/3}\log(T/\delta))$ swap regret w.p. $\ge 1-\delta$ for any proper loss with a smooth univariate form, which implies $O(T^{1/3})$ $\ell_2$-Calibration error. A technical contribution of our work is a new randomized rounding procedure and a non-uniform discretization scheme to minimize the swap regret for log loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weian Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Online learning is a model of machine learning where the learner is trained on sequential feedback. We investigate worst-case error for the online learning of real functions that have certain smoothness constraints. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}_q$ is the class of all absolutely continuous functions $f: [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\|f'\|_q \le 1$, and $\operatorname{opt}_p(\mathcal{F}_q)$ is the best possible upper bound on the sum of the $p^{\text{th}}$ powers of absolute prediction errors for any number of trials guaranteed by any learner. We show that for any $\delta, \epsilon \in (0, 1)$, $\operatorname{opt}_{1+\delta} (\mathcal{F}_{1+\epsilon}) = O(\min(\delta, \epsilon)^{-1})$. Combined with the previous results of Kimber and Long (1995) and Geneson and Zhou (2023), we achieve a complete characterization of the values of $p, q \ge 1$ that result in $\operatorname{opt}_p(\mathcal{F}_q)$ being finite, a problem open for nearly 30 years.
  We study the learning scenarios of smooth functions that also belong to certain special families of functions, such as polynomials. We prove a conjecture by Geneson and Zhou (2023) that it is not any easier to learn a polynomial in $\mathcal{F}_q$ than it is to learn any general function in $\mathcal{F}_q$. We also define a noisy model for the online learning of smooth functions, where the learner may receive incorrect feedback up to $\eta \ge 1$ times, denoting the worst-case error bound as $\operatorname{opt}^{\text{nf}}_{p, \eta} (\mathcal{F}_q)$. We prove that $\operatorname{opt}^{\text{nf}}_{p, \eta} (\mathcal{F}_q)$ is finite if and only if $\operatorname{opt}_p(\mathcal{F}_q)$ is. Moreover, we prove for all $p, q \ge 2$ and $\eta \ge 1$ that $\operatorname{opt}^{\text{nf}}_{p, \eta} (\mathcal{F}_q) = \Theta (\eta)$.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16395">An Analyst-Inspector Framework for Evaluating Reproducibility of LLMs in Data Science</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuhai Zeng, Claire Jin, Xinyue Wang, Yuhan Zheng, Qunhua Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for data science tasks via code generation. However, the exploratory nature of data science, alongside the stochastic and opaque outputs of LLMs, raise concerns about their reliability. While prior work focuses on benchmarking LLM accuracy, reproducibility remains underexplored, despite being critical to establishing trust in LLM-driven analysis.
  We propose a novel analyst-inspector framework to automatically evaluate and enforce the reproducibility of LLM-generated data science workflows - the first rigorous approach to the best of our knowledge. Defining reproducibility as the sufficiency and completeness of workflows for reproducing functionally equivalent code, this framework enforces computational reproducibility principles, ensuring transparent, well-documented LLM workflows while minimizing reliance on implicit model assumptions.
  Using this framework, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs on 1,032 data analysis tasks across three diverse benchmark datasets. We also introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies. Our results show that higher reproducibility strongly correlates with improved accuracy and reproducibility-enhancing prompts are effective, demonstrating structured prompting's potential to enhance automated data science workflows and enable transparent, robust AI-driven analysis. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Hallaji, Roozbeh Razavi-Far, Mehrdad Saif</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning systems are increasingly threatened by data poisoning attacks, where malicious clients compromise global models by contributing tampered updates. Existing defenses often rely on impractical assumptions, such as access to a central test dataset, or fail to generalize across diverse attack types, particularly those involving multiple malicious clients working collaboratively. To address this, we propose Federated Noise-Induced Activation Analysis (FedNIA), a novel defense framework to identify and exclude adversarial clients without relying on any central test dataset. FedNIA injects random noise inputs to analyze the layerwise activation patterns in client models leveraging an autoencoder that detects abnormal behaviors indicative of data poisoning. FedNIA can defend against diverse attack types, including sample poisoning, label flipping, and backdoors, even in scenarios with multiple attacking nodes. Experimental results on non-iid federated datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness, underscoring its potential as a foundational approach for enhancing the security of federated learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ehsan Hallaji, Roozbeh Razavi-Far, Mehrdad Saif</p>
<p>Abstract: The server-less nature of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) requires allocating the aggregation role to specific participants in each federated round. Current DFL architectures ensure the trustworthiness of the aggregator node upon selection. However, most of these studies overlook the possibility that the aggregating node may turn rogue and act maliciously after being nominated. To address this problem, this paper proposes a DFL structure, called TrustChain, that scores the aggregators before selection based on their past behavior and additionally audits them after the aggregation. To do this, the statistical independence between the client updates and the aggregated model is continuously monitored using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The proposed method relies on several principles, including blockchain, anomaly detection, and concept drift analysis. The designed structure is evaluated on several federated datasets and attack scenarios with different numbers of Byzantine nodes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liancheng Fang, Aiwei Liu, Hengrui Zhang, Henry Peng Zou, Weizhi Zhang, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have achieved encouraging results in tabular data generation. However, existing approaches require fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive. This paper explores an alternative: prompting a fixed LLM with in-context examples. We observe that using randomly selected in-context examples hampers the LLM's performance, resulting in sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose a novel in-context learning framework: TabGen-ICL, to enhance the in-context learning ability of LLMs for tabular data generation. TabGen-ICL operates iteratively, retrieving a subset of real samples that represent the residual between currently generated samples and true data distributions. This approach serves two purposes: locally, it provides more effective in-context learning examples for the LLM in each iteration; globally, it progressively narrows the gap between generated and real data. Extensive experiments on five real-world tabular datasets demonstrate that TabGen-ICL significantly outperforms the random selection strategy. Specifically, it reduces the error rate by a margin of $3.5\%-42.2\%$ on fidelity metrics. We demonstrate for the first time that prompting a fixed LLM can yield high-quality synthetic tabular data.

<p>Abstract: In machine learning, classification is usually seen as a function approximation problem, where the goal is to learn a function that maps input features to class labels. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering and classification framework inspired by the principles of signal separation. This approach enables efficient identification of class supports, even in the presence of overlapping distributions. We validate our method on real-world hyperspectral datasets Salinas and Indian Pines. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is competitive with the state of the art active learning algorithms by using a very small subset of data set as training points.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntong Hu, Junxiang Wang, Liang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Network tomography is a crucial problem in network monitoring, where the observable path performance metric values are used to infer the unobserved ones, making it essential for tasks such as route selection, fault diagnosis, and traffic control. However, most existing methods either assume complete knowledge of network topology and metric formulas-an unrealistic expectation in many real-world scenarios with limited observability-or rely entirely on black-box end-to-end models. To tackle this, in this paper, we argue that a good network tomography requires synergizing the knowledge from both data and appropriate inductive bias from (partial) prior knowledge. To see this, we propose Deep Network Tomography (DeepNT), a novel framework that leverages a path-centric graph neural network to predict path performance metrics without relying on predefined hand-crafted metrics, assumptions, or the real network topology. The path-centric graph neural network learns the path embedding by inferring and aggregating the embeddings of the sequence of nodes that compose this path. Training path-centric graph neural networks requires learning the neural netowrk parameters and network topology under discrete constraints induced by the observed path performance metrics, which motivates us to design a learning objective that imposes connectivity and sparsity constraints on topology and path performance triangle inequality on path performance. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of DeepNT in predicting performance metrics and inferring graph topology compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16431">UniDyG: A Unified and Effective Representation Learning Approach for Large Dynamic Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanyuan Xu, Wenjie Zhang, Xuemin Lin, Ying Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic graphs are formulated in continuous-time or discrete-time dynamic graphs. They differ in temporal granularity: Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) exhibit rapid, localized changes, while Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs) show gradual, global updates. This difference leads to isolated developments in representation learning for each type. To advance representation learning, recent research attempts to design a unified model capable of handling both CTDGs and DTDGs. However, it typically focuses on local dynamic propagation for temporal structure learning in the time domain, failing to accurately capture the structural evolution associated with each temporal granularity. In addition, existing works-whether specific or unified-often overlook the issue of temporal noise, compromising the model robustness and effectiveness. To better model both types of dynamic graphs, we propose UniDyG, a unified and effective representation learning approach, which scales to large dynamic graphs. We first propose a novel Fourier Graph Attention (FGAT) mechanism that can model local and global structural correlations based on recent neighbors and complex-number selective aggregation, while theoretically ensuring consistent representations of dynamic graphs over time. Based on approximation theory, we demonstrate that FGAT is well-suited to capture the underlying structures in CTDGs and DTDGs. We further enhance FGAT to resist temporal noise by designing an energy-gated unit, which adaptively filters out high-frequency noise according to the energy. Last, we leverage our FGAT mechanisms for temporal structure learning and employ the frequency-enhanced linear function for node-level dynamic updates, facilitating the generation of high-quality temporal embeddings. Extensive experiments show that our UniDyG achieves an average improvement of 14.4% over sixteen baselines across nine dynamic graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nian Ran, Fayez M. Al-Alweet, Richard Allmendinger, Ahmad Almakhlafi</p>
<p>Abstract: In multiphase flow systems, classifying flow patterns is crucial to optimize fluid dynamics and enhance system efficiency. Current industrial methods and scientific laboratories mainly depend on techniques such as flow visualization using regular cameras or the naked eye, as well as high-speed imaging at elevated flow rates. These methods are limited by their reliance on subjective interpretations and are particularly applicable in transparent pipes. Consequently, conventional techniques usually achieve context-dependent accuracy rates and often lack generalizability. This study introduces a novel platform that integrates a capacitance sensor and AI-driven classification methods, benchmarked against traditional techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach, utilizing a 1D SENet deep learning model, achieves over 85\% accuracy on experiment-based datasets and 71\% accuracy on pattern-based datasets. These results highlight significant improvements in robustness and reliability compared to existing methodologies. This work offers a transformative pathway for real-time flow monitoring and predictive modeling, addressing key challenges in industrial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Frantar, Utku Evci, Wonpyo Park, Neil Houlsby, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate how different compression techniques -- such as weight and activation quantization, and weight sparsity -- affect the scaling behavior of large language models (LLMs) during pretraining. Building on previous work showing that weight sparsity acts as a constant multiplier on model size in scaling laws, we demonstrate that this "effective parameter" scaling pattern extends to quantization as well. Specifically, we establish that weight-only quantization achieves strong parameter efficiency multipliers, while full quantization of both weights and activations shows diminishing returns at lower bitwidths. Our results suggest that different compression techniques can be unified under a common scaling law framework, enabling principled comparison and combination of these methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models for image generation are now commonly used for a wide variety of applications, ranging from guided image generation for entertainment to solving inverse problems. Nonetheless, training a generator is a non-trivial feat that requires fine-tuning and can lead to so-called hallucinations, that is, the generation of images that are unrealistic. In this work, we explore image generation using flow matching. We explain and demonstrate why flow matching can generate hallucinations, and propose an iterative process to improve the generation process. Our iterative process can be integrated into virtually $\textit{any}$ generative modeling technique, thereby enhancing the performance and robustness of image synthesis systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Tang, Jing Long, Junmei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce Auxiliary Discriminator Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks (ADSeqGAN), a novel approach for molecular generation in small-sample datasets. Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity.
  Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility.
  Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery. We have demonstrated the successful applications of ADSeqGAN in generating synthetic nucleic acid-targeting and CNS drugs in this work.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16454">MAPN: Enhancing Heterogeneous Sparse Graph Representation by Mamba-based Asynchronous Aggregation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuqi Mao, Zhenying He, X. Sean Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state of the art for various graph-related tasks and are particularly prominent in heterogeneous graphs (HetGs). However, several issues plague this paradigm: first, the difficulty in fully utilizing long-range information, known as over-squashing; second, the tendency for excessive message-passing layers to produce indistinguishable representations, referred to as over-smoothing; and finally, the inadequacy of conventional MPNNs to train effectively on large sparse graphs. To address these challenges in deep neural networks for large-scale heterogeneous graphs, this paper introduces the Mamba-based Asynchronous Propagation Network (MAPN), which enhances the representation of heterogeneous sparse graphs. MAPN consists of two primary components: node sequence generation and semantic information aggregation. Node sequences are initially generated based on meta-paths through random walks, which serve as the foundation for a spatial state model that extracts essential information from nodes at various distances. It then asynchronously aggregates semantic information across multiple hops and layers, effectively preserving unique node characteristics and mitigating issues related to deep network degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPN in graph embeddings for various downstream tasks underscoring its substantial benefits for graph representation in large sparse heterogeneous graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prafful Kumar Khoba, Zijian Wang, Chetan Arora, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging a transferability estimation metric facilitates the non-trivial challenge of selecting the optimal model for the downstream task from a pool of pre-trained models. Most existing metrics primarily focus on identifying the statistical relationship between feature embeddings and the corresponding labels within the target dataset, but overlook crucial aspect of model robustness. This oversight may limit their effectiveness in accurately ranking pre-trained models. To address this limitation, we introduce a feature perturbation method that enhances the transferability estimation process by systematically altering the feature space. Our method includes a Spread operation that increases intra-class variability, adding complexity within classes, and an Attract operation that minimizes the distances between different classes, thereby blurring the class boundaries. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our feature perturbation method in providing a more precise and robust estimation of model transferability. Notably, the existing LogMe method exhibited a significant improvement, showing a 28.84% increase in performance after applying our feature perturbation method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhou Yang, Yucai Pang, Hongbo Yin, Yunpeng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new Transformer, called MS$^2$Dformer, that can be used as a generalized backbone for multi-modal sequence spammer detection. Spammer detection is a complex multi-modal task, thus the challenges of applying Transformer are two-fold. Firstly, complex multi-modal noisy information about users can interfere with feature mining. Secondly, the long sequence of users' historical behaviors also puts a huge GPU memory pressure on the attention computation. To solve these problems, we first design a user behavior Tokenization algorithm based on the multi-modal variational autoencoder (MVAE). Subsequently, a hierarchical split-window multi-head attention (SW/W-MHA) mechanism is proposed. The split-window strategy transforms the ultra-long sequences hierarchically into a combination of intra-window short-term and inter-window overall attention. Pre-trained on the public datasets, MS$^2$Dformer's performance far exceeds the previous state of the art. The experiments demonstrate MS$^2$Dformer's ability to act as a backbone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyue Gong, Yekun Ke, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: The expressive power and computational complexity of deep visual generative models, such as flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models, have gained considerable interest for their wide-ranging applications in generative tasks. However, the theoretical characterization of their expressiveness through the lens of circuit complexity remains underexplored, particularly for the state-of-the-art architecture like FlowAR proposed by [Ren et al., 2024], which integrates flow-based and autoregressive mechanisms. This gap limits our understanding of their inherent computational limits and practical efficiency. In this study, we address this gap by analyzing the circuit complexity of the FlowAR architecture. We demonstrate that when the largest feature map produced by the FlowAR model has dimensions $n \times n \times c$, the FlowAR model is simulable by a family of threshold circuits $\mathsf{TC}^0$, which have constant depth $O(1)$ and polynomial width $\mathrm{poly}(n)$. This is the first study to rigorously highlight the limitations in the expressive power of FlowAR models. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the FlowAR model computations can achieve almost quadratic time. To validate our theoretical findings, we present efficient model variant constructions based on low-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria. Our work provides a foundation for future comparisons with other generative paradigms and guides the development of more efficient and expressive implementations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Hu, Muning Wen, Xihuai Wang, Shao Zhang, Yiwei Shi, Minne Li, Minglong Li, Ying Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in coordinating agents due to complex interdependencies within multi-agent systems. Most MARL algorithms use the simultaneous decision-making paradigm but ignore the action-level dependencies among agents, which reduces coordination efficiency. In contrast, the sequential decision-making paradigm provides finer-grained supervision for agent decision order, presenting the potential for handling dependencies via better decision order management. However, determining the optimal decision order remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Action Generation with Plackett-Luce Sampling (AGPS), a novel mechanism for agent decision order optimization. We model the order determination task as a Plackett-Luce sampling process to address issues such as ranking instability and vanishing gradient during the network training process. AGPS realizes credit-based decision order determination by establishing a bridge between the significance of agents' local observations and their decision credits, thus facilitating order optimization and dependency management. Integrating AGPS with the Multi-Agent Transformer, we propose the Prioritized Multi-Agent Transformer (PMAT), a sequential decision-making MARL algorithm with decision order optimization. Experiments on benchmarks including StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo show that PMAT outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, greatly enhancing coordination efficiency.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16519">Guarding the Privacy of Label-Only Access to Neural Network Classifiers via iDP Verification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anan Kabaha, Dana Drachsler-Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are susceptible to privacy attacks that can extract private information of the training set. To cope, several training algorithms guarantee differential privacy (DP) by adding noise to their computation. However, DP requires to add noise considering every possible training set. This leads to a significant decrease in the network's accuracy. Individual DP (iDP) restricts DP to a given training set. We observe that some inputs deterministically satisfy iDP without any noise. By identifying them, we can provide iDP label-only access to the network with a minor decrease to its accuracy. However, identifying the inputs that satisfy iDP without any noise is highly challenging. Our key idea is to compute the iDP deterministic bound (iDP-DB), which overapproximates the set of inputs that do not satisfy iDP, and add noise only to their predicted labels. To compute the tightest iDP-DB, which enables to guard the label-only access with minimal accuracy decrease, we propose LUCID, which leverages several formal verification techniques. First, it encodes the problem as a mixed-integer linear program, defined over a network and over every network trained identically but without a unique data point. Second, it abstracts a set of networks using a hyper-network. Third, it eliminates the overapproximation error via a novel branch-and-bound technique. Fourth, it bounds the differences of matching neurons in the network and the hyper-network and employs linear relaxation if they are small. We show that LUCID can provide classifiers with a perfect individuals' privacy guarantee (0-iDP) -- which is infeasible for DP training algorithms -- with an accuracy decrease of 1.4%. For more relaxed $\varepsilon$-iDP guarantees, LUCID has an accuracy decrease of 1.2%. In contrast, existing DP training algorithms reduce the accuracy by 12.7%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bishwajit Prasad Gond</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of supply chains and the rising costs associated with defective or substandard goods (bad goods) highlight the urgent need for advanced predictive methodologies to mitigate risks and enhance operational efficiency. This research presents a novel framework that integrates Time Series ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models with a proprietary formula specifically designed to calculate bad goods after time series forecasting. By leveraging historical data patterns, including sales, returns, and capacity, the model forecasts potential quality failures, enabling proactive decision-making. ARIMA is employed to capture temporal trends in time series data, while the newly developed formula quantifies the likelihood and impact of defects with greater precision. Experimental results, validated on a dataset spanning 2022-2024 for Organic Beer-G 1 Liter, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional statistical models, such as Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters, in both prediction accuracy and risk evaluation. This study advances the field of predictive analytics by bridging time series forecasting, ARIMA, and risk management in supply chain quality control, offering a scalable and practical solution for minimizing losses due to bad goods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated a strong capability in modeling graph structures by addressing the intrinsic limitations of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as over-smoothing and over-squashing. Recent studies have proposed diverse architectures, enhanced explainability, and practical applications for Graph Transformers. In light of these rapid developments, we conduct a comprehensive review of Graph Transformers, covering aspects such as their architectures, theoretical foundations, and applications within this survey. We categorize the architecture of Graph Transformers according to their strategies for processing structural information, including graph tokenization, positional encoding, structure-aware attention and model ensemble. Furthermore, from the theoretical perspective, we examine the expressivity of Graph Transformers in various discussed architectures and contrast them with other advanced graph learning algorithms to discover the connections. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the practical applications where Graph Transformers have been utilized, such as molecule, protein, language, vision traffic, brain and material data. At the end of this survey, we will discuss the current challenges and prospective directions in Graph Transformers for potential future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianzhou Chen, Xiumei Wang, Jinyang Sun, Xi Chen, Heyu Chu, Guo Song, Yuji Luo, Xingping Zhou, Rong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with millons of deaths each year, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health agencies. While significant progress has been made in the field of heart failure, leading to improved survival rates and improvement of ejection fraction, there remains substantial unmet needs, due to the complexity and multifactorial characteristics. Therefore, we propose a composable strategy framework for assessment and treatment optimization in heart failure. This framework simulates the doctor-patient consultation process and leverages multi-modal algorithms to analyze a range of data, including video, physical examination, text results as well as medical history. By integrating these various data sources, our framework offers a more holistic evaluation and optimized treatment plan for patients. Our results demonstrate that this multi-modal approach outperforms single-modal artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in terms of accuracy in heart failure (HF) prognosis prediction. Through this method, we can further evaluate the impact of various pathological indicators on HF prognosis,providing a more comprehensive evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized fields from natural language processing to computer vision, yet their internal computational dynamics remain poorly understood raising concerns about predictability and robustness. In this work, we introduce Entropy-Lens, a scalable, model-agnostic framework that leverages information theory to interpret frozen, off-the-shelf large-scale transformers. By quantifying the evolution of Shannon entropy within intermediate residual streams, our approach extracts computational signatures that distinguish model families, categorize task-specific prompts, and correlate with output accuracy. We further demonstrate the generality of our method by extending the analysis to vision transformers. Our results suggest that entropy-based metrics can serve as a principled tool for unveiling the inner workings of modern transformer architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhang, Zewei Zhou, Zhaoyi Wang, Yangjie Ji, Yanjun Huang, Hong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lulu Kang, Minshen Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression is a popular surrogate modeling tool for computer simulations in engineering and scientific domains. However, it often struggles with high computational costs and low prediction accuracy when the simulation involves too many input variables. For some simulation models, the outputs may only be significantly influenced by a small subset of the input variables, referred to as the ``active variables''. We propose an optimal kernel learning approach to identify these active variables, thereby overcoming GP model limitations and enhancing system understanding. Our method approximates the original GP model's covariance function through a convex combination of kernel functions, each utilizing low-dimensional subsets of input variables. Inspired by the Fedorov-Wynn algorithm from optimal design literature, we develop an optimal kernel learning algorithm to determine this approximation. We incorporate the effect heredity principle, a concept borrowed from the field of ``design and analysis of experiments'', to ensure sparsity in active variable selection. Through several examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternative approaches in correctly identifying active input variables and improving prediction accuracy. It is an effective solution for interpreting the surrogate GP regression and simplifying the complex underlying system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arshia Kermani, Ehsan Zeraatkar, Habib Irani</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing computational demands of transformer models in time series classification necessitate effective optimization strategies for energy-efficient deployment. This paper presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 1.63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruichu Cai, Junxian Huang, Zhenhui Yang, Zijian Li, Emadeldeen Eldele, Min Wu, Fuchun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series domain adaptation aims to transfer the complex temporal dependence from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Recent advances leverage the stable causal mechanism over observed variables to model the domain-invariant temporal dependence. However, modeling precise causal structures in high-dimensional data, such as videos, remains challenging. Additionally, direct causal edges may not exist among observed variables (e.g., pixels). These limitations hinder the applicability of existing approaches to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we find that the high-dimension time series data are generated from the low-dimension latent variables, which motivates us to model the causal mechanisms of the temporal latent process. Based on this intuition, we propose a latent causal mechanism identification framework that guarantees the uniqueness of the reconstructed latent causal structures. Specifically, we first identify latent variables by utilizing sufficient changes in historical information. Moreover, by enforcing the sparsity of the relationships of latent variables, we can achieve identifiable latent causal structures. Built on the theoretical results, we develop the Latent Causality Alignment (LCA) model that leverages variational inference, which incorporates an intra-domain latent sparsity constraint for latent structure reconstruction and an inter-domain latent sparsity constraint for domain-invariant structure reconstruction. Experiment results on eight benchmarks show a general improvement in the domain-adaptive time series classification and forecasting tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyi Qu, David Aponte, Colby Banbury, Daniel P. Robinson, Tianyu Ding, Kazuhito Koishida, Ilya Zharkov, Tianyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning and quantization are fundamental techniques used to reduce the size of deep neural networks (DNNs) and typically are applied independently. Applying these techniques jointly via co-optimization has the potential to produce smaller, high-quality models. However, existing joint schemes are not widely used because of (1) engineering difficulties (complicated multi-stage processes), (2) black-box optimization (extensive hyperparameter tuning to control the overall compression), and (3) insufficient architecture generalization. To address these limitations, we present the framework GETA, which automatically and efficiently performs joint structured pruning and quantization-aware training on any DNNs. GETA introduces three key innovations: (i) a quantization-aware dependency graph (QADG) that constructs a pruning search space for generic quantization-aware DNN, (ii) a partially projected stochastic gradient method that guarantees layerwise bit constraints are satisfied, and (iii) a new joint learning strategy that incorporates interpretable relationships between pruning and quantization. We present numerical experiments on both convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures that show that our approach achieves competitive (often superior) performance compared to existing joint pruning and quantization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thiem Nguyen, Anh Nguyen, Quyen Tran, Tu Vu, Diep Nguyen, Linh Ngo, Thien Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Typically, Few-shot Continual Relation Extraction (FCRE) models must balance retaining prior knowledge while adapting to new tasks with extremely limited data. However, real-world scenarios may also involve unseen or undetermined relations that existing methods still struggle to handle. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages the Open Information Extraction concept of Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC). Our method not only exposes models to all possible pairs of relations, including determined and undetermined labels not available in the training set, but also enriches model knowledge with diverse relation descriptions, thereby enhancing knowledge retention and adaptability in this challenging scenario. In the perspective of KGC, this is the first work explored in the setting of Continual Learning, allowing efficient expansion of the graph as the data evolves. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art FCRE baselines, as well as the efficiency in handling dynamic graph construction in this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Gao, Liren Shan, Vaidehi Srinivas, Aravindan Vijayaraghavan</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal Prediction is a widely studied technique to construct prediction sets of future observations. Most conformal prediction methods focus on achieving the necessary coverage guarantees, but do not provide formal guarantees on the size (volume) of the prediction sets. We first prove an impossibility of volume optimality where any distribution-free method can only find a trivial solution. We then introduce a new notion of volume optimality by restricting the prediction sets to belong to a set family (of finite VC-dimension), specifically a union of $k$-intervals. Our main contribution is an efficient distribution-free algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP) to find a union of $k$-intervals that is guaranteed for any distribution to have near-optimal volume among all unions of $k$-intervals satisfying the desired coverage property. By adopting the framework of distributional conformal prediction (Chernozhukov et al., 2021), the new DP based conformity score can also be applied to achieve approximate conditional coverage and conditional restricted volume optimality, as long as a reasonable estimator of the conditional CDF is available. While the theoretical results already establish volume-optimality guarantees, they are complemented by experiments that demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform existing methods in many settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Alesiani, Takashi Maruyama, Henrik Christiansen, Viktor Zaverkin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem (KAT), or more generally, the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem (KST), establishes that any non-linear multivariate function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of non-linear univariate functions. Unlike the universal approximation theorem, which provides only an approximate representation without guaranteeing a fixed network size, KST offers a theoretically exact decomposition. The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was introduced as a trainable model to implement KAT, and recent advancements have adapted KAN using concepts from modern neural networks. However, KAN struggles to effectively model physical systems that require inherent equivariance or invariance to $E(3)$ transformations, a key property for many scientific and engineering applications. In this work, we propose a novel extension of KAT and KAN to incorporate equivariance and invariance over $O(n)$ group actions, enabling accurate and efficient modeling of these systems. Our approach provides a unified approach that bridges the gap between mathematical theory and practical architectures for physical systems, expanding the applicability of KAN to a broader class of problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scalable and generalizable physics-aware deep learning has long been considered a significant challenge with various applications across diverse domains ranging from robotics to molecular dynamics. Central to almost all physical systems are symplectic forms, the geometric backbone that underpins fundamental invariants like energy and momentum. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, MetaSym. In particular, MetaSym combines a strong symplectic inductive bias obtained from a symplectic encoder and an autoregressive decoder with meta-attention. This principled design ensures that core physical invariants remain intact while allowing flexible, data-efficient adaptation to system heterogeneities. We benchmark MetaSym on highly varied datasets such as a high-dimensional spring mesh system (Otness et al., 2021), an open quantum system with dissipation and measurement backaction, and robotics-inspired quadrotor dynamics. Our results demonstrate superior performance in modeling dynamics under few-shot adaptation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with far larger models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16681">Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful? A Case Study in Sparse Probing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhash Kantamneni, Joshua Engels, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Max Tegmark, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for interpreting concepts represented in large language model (LLM) activations. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the validity of their interpretations due to the lack of a ground truth for the concepts used by an LLM, and a growing number of works have presented problems with current SAEs. One alternative source of evidence would be demonstrating that SAEs improve performance on downstream tasks beyond existing baselines. We test this by applying SAEs to the real-world task of LLM activation probing in four regimes: data scarcity, class imbalance, label noise, and covariate shift. Due to the difficulty of detecting concepts in these challenging settings, we hypothesize that SAEs' basis of interpretable, concept-level latents should provide a useful inductive bias. However, although SAEs occasionally perform better than baselines on individual datasets, we are unable to design ensemble methods combining SAEs with baselines that consistently outperform ensemble methods solely using baselines. Additionally, although SAEs initially appear promising for identifying spurious correlations, detecting poor dataset quality, and training multi-token probes, we are able to achieve similar results with simple non-SAE baselines as well. Though we cannot discount SAEs' utility on other tasks, our findings highlight the shortcomings of current SAEs and the need to rigorously evaluate interpretability methods on downstream tasks with strong baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) enhance highway safety by improving environmental perception and reducing human errors. However, misconceptions, trust issues, and knowledge gaps hinder widespread adoption. This study examines driver perceptions, knowledge sources, and usage patterns of ADAS in passenger vehicles. A nationwide survey collected data from a diverse sample of U.S. drivers. Machine learning models predicted ADAS adoption, with SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) identifying key influencing factors. Findings indicate that higher trust levels correlate with increased ADAS usage, while concerns about reliability remain a barrier. Specific features, such as Forward Collision Warning and Driver Monitoring Systems, significantly influence adoption likelihood. Demographic factors (age, gender) and driving habits (experience, frequency) also shape ADAS acceptance. Findings emphasize the influence of socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral factors on ADAS adoption, offering guidance for automakers, policymakers, and safety advocates to improve awareness, trust, and usability.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4, BART, and LLaMA, the need for a system that can intelligently select the most suitable model for specific tasks while balancing cost, latency, accuracy, and ethical considerations has become increasingly important. Recognizing that not all tasks necessitate models with over 100 billion parameters, we introduce OptiRoute, an advanced model routing engine designed to dynamically select and route tasks to the optimal LLM based on detailed user-defined requirements. OptiRoute captures both functional (e.g., accuracy, speed, cost) and non-functional (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty) criteria, leveraging lightweight task analysis and complexity estimation to efficiently match tasks with the best-fit models from a diverse array of LLMs. By employing a hybrid approach combining k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search and hierarchical filtering, OptiRoute optimizes for user priorities while minimizing computational overhead. This makes it ideal for real-time applications in cloud-based ML platforms, personalized AI services, and regulated industries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mika Sarkin Jain, Stefanie Jegelka, Ishani Karmarkar, Luana Ruiz, Ellen Vitercik</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we subsample graph data so that a graph neural network (GNN) trained on the subsample achieves performance comparable to training on the full dataset? This question is of fundamental interest, as smaller datasets reduce labeling costs, storage requirements, and computational resources needed for training. Selecting an effective subset is challenging: a poorly chosen subsample can severely degrade model performance, and empirically testing multiple subsets for quality obviates the benefits of subsampling. Therefore, it is critical that subsampling comes with guarantees on model performance. In this work, we introduce new subsampling methods for graph datasets that leverage the Tree Mover's Distance to reduce both the number of graphs and the size of individual graphs. To our knowledge, our approach is the first that is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees: we prove that training a GNN on the subsampled data results in a bounded increase in loss compared to training on the full dataset. Unlike existing methods, our approach is both model-agnostic, requiring minimal assumptions about the GNN architecture, and label-agnostic, eliminating the need to label the full training set. This enables subsampling early in the model development pipeline (before data annotation, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning) reducing costs and resources needed for storage, labeling, and training. We validate our theoretical results with experiments showing that our approach outperforms existing subsampling methods across multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Light, Wei Cheng, Wu Yue, Masafumi Oyamada, Mengdi Wang, Santiago Paternain, Haifeng Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Many inference scaling methods work by breaking a problem into smaller steps (or groups of tokens), then sampling and choosing the best next step. However, these steps and their sizes are usually predetermined based on human intuition or domain knowledge. This paper introduces dynamic decomposition, a method that automatically and adaptively splits solution and reasoning traces into steps during inference. This approach improves computational efficiency by focusing more resources on difficult steps, breaking them down further and prioritizing their sampling. Experiments on coding and math benchmarks (APPS, MATH, and LiveCodeBench) show that dynamic decomposition performs better than static methods, which rely on fixed steps like token-level, sentence-level, or single-step decompositions. These results suggest that dynamic decomposition can enhance many inference scaling techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing demand for data privacy in Machine Learning (ML) applications has seen Machine Unlearning (MU) emerge as a critical area of research. As the `right to be forgotten' becomes regulated globally, it is increasingly important to develop mechanisms that delete user data from AI systems while maintaining performance and scalability of these systems. Incremental Unlearning (IU) is a promising MU solution to address the challenges of efficiently removing specific data from ML models without the need for expensive and time-consuming full retraining. This paper presents the various techniques and approaches to IU. It explores the challenges faced in designing and implementing IU mechanisms. Datasets and metrics for evaluating the performance of unlearning techniques are discussed as well. Finally, potential solutions to the IU challenges alongside future research directions are offered. This survey provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand the current landscape of IU and its potential for enhancing privacy-preserving intelligent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the understudied practice of weight sharing (WS) in variational graph autoencoders (VGAE). WS presents both benefits and drawbacks for VGAE model design and node embedding learning, leaving its overall relevance unclear and the question of whether it should be adopted unresolved. We rigorously analyze its implications and, through extensive experiments on a wide range of graphs and VGAE variants, demonstrate that the benefits of WS consistently outweigh its drawbacks. Based on our findings, we recommend WS as an effective approach to optimize, regularize, and simplify VGAE models without significant performance loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongzhe Cheng, Tianyou Zheng, Tianyi Zhang, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Weiming Zhi</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-Distribution(OOD) detection, a fundamental machine learning task aimed at identifying abnormal samples, traditionally requires model retraining for different inlier distributions. While recent research demonstrates the applicability of diffusion models to OOD detection, existing approaches are limited to Euclidean or latent image spaces. Our work extends OOD detection to trajectories in the Special Euclidean Group in 3D ($\mathbb{SE}(3)$), addressing a critical need in computer vision, robotics, and engineering applications that process object pose sequences in $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. We present $\textbf{D}$iffusion-based $\textbf{O}$ut-of-distribution detection on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ ($\mathbf{DOSE3}$), a novel OOD framework that extends diffusion to a unified sample space of $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ pose sequences. Through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate $\mathbf{DOSE3}$'s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art OOD detection frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshay Mehra, Trisha Mittal, Subhadra Gopalakrishnan, Joshua Kimball</p>
<p>Abstract: Coreset Selection (CS) identifies a subset of training data that achieves model performance comparable to using the entire dataset. Many state-of-the-art CS methods, select coresets using scores whose computation requires training the downstream model on the entire dataset and recording changes in its behavior on samples as it trains (training dynamics). These scores are inefficient to compute and hard to interpret as they do not indicate whether a sample is difficult to learn in general or only for a specific model. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing an interpretable score that gauges a sample's difficulty using human-understandable textual attributes (concepts) independent of any downstream model. Specifically, we measure the alignment between a sample's visual features and concept bottlenecks, derived via large language models, by training a linear concept bottleneck layer and compute the sample's difficulty score using it. We then use this score and a stratified sampling strategy to identify the coreset. Crucially, our score is efficiently computable without training the downstream model on the full dataset even once, leads to high-performing coresets for various downstream models, and is computable even for an unlabeled dataset. Through experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, we show our coresets outperform random subsets, even at high pruning rates, and achieve model performance comparable to or better than coresets found by training dynamics-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Li, Zicheng Zhang, Wang Luo, Congying Han, Jiayu Lv, Tiande Guo, Yudong Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents against adversarial attacks is critical for their trustworthy deployment. Recent research highlights the challenges of achieving state-adversarial robustness and suggests that an optimal robust policy (ORP) does not always exist, complicating the enforcement of strict robustness constraints. In this paper, we further explore the concept of ORP. We first introduce the Intrinsic State-adversarial Markov Decision Process (ISA-MDP), a novel formulation where adversaries cannot fundamentally alter the intrinsic nature of state observations. ISA-MDP, supported by empirical and theoretical evidence, universally characterizes decision-making under state-adversarial paradigms. We rigorously prove that within ISA-MDP, a deterministic and stationary ORP exists, aligning with the Bellman optimal policy. Our findings theoretically reveal that improving DRL robustness does not necessarily compromise performance in natural environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of infinity measurement error (IME) in both $Q$-function and probability spaces to achieve ORP, unveiling vulnerabilities of previous DRL algorithms that rely on $1$-measurement errors. Motivated by these insights, we develop the Consistent Adversarial Robust Reinforcement Learning (CAR-RL) framework, which optimizes surrogates of IME. We apply CAR-RL to both value-based and policy-based DRL algorithms, achieving superior performance and validating our theoretical analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Peng Gao, Yu Shen, Ming Lin, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge transfer between teacher and student models has proven effective across various machine learning applications. However, challenges arise when the teacher's predictions are noisy, or the data domain during student training shifts from the teacher's pretraining data. In such scenarios, blindly relying on the teacher's predictions can lead to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and universal framework, Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Knowledge Transfer ($\textbf{AUKT}$), which leverages Conformal Prediction (CP) to dynamically adjust the student's reliance on the teacher's guidance based on the teacher's prediction uncertainty. CP is a distribution-free, model-agnostic approach that provides reliable prediction sets with statistical coverage guarantees and minimal computational overhead. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the risk of learning undesirable or incorrect knowledge. We validate the proposed framework across diverse applications, including image classification, imitation-guided reinforcement learning, and autonomous driving. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach improves performance, robustness and transferability, offering a promising direction for enhanced knowledge transfer in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinandan Bose, Laurent Lessard, Maryam Fazel, Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of foundation models fine-tuned on human feedback from potentially untrusted users has increased the risk of adversarial data poisoning, necessitating the study of robustness of learning algorithms against such attacks. Existing research on provable certified robustness against data poisoning attacks primarily focuses on certifying robustness for static adversaries who modify a fraction of the dataset used to train the model before the training algorithm is applied. In practice, particularly when learning from human feedback in an online sense, adversaries can observe and react to the learning process and inject poisoned samples that optimize adversarial objectives better than when they are restricted to poisoning a static dataset once, before the learning algorithm is applied. Indeed, it has been shown in prior work that online dynamic adversaries can be significantly more powerful than static ones. We present a novel framework for computing certified bounds on the impact of dynamic poisoning, and use these certificates to design robust learning algorithms. We give an illustration of the framework for the mean estimation and binary classification problems and outline directions for extending this in further work. The code to implement our certificates and replicate our results is available at https://github.com/Avinandan22/Certified-Robustness.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16744">Order-Optimal Projection-Free Algorithm for Adversarially Constrained Online Convex Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Lu, Mohammad Pedramfar, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Projection-based algorithms for constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) face scalability challenges in high-dimensional settings due to the computational complexity of projecting iterates onto constraint sets. This paper introduces a projection-free algorithm for COCO that achieves state-of-the-art performance guarantees while eliminating the need for projections. By integrating a separation oracle with adaptive Online Gradient Descent (OGD) and employing a Lyapunov-driven surrogate function, while dynamically adjusting step sizes using gradient norms, our method jointly optimizes the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV). We also use a blocked version of OGD that helps achieve tradeoffs betweeen the regret and CCV with the number of calls to the separation oracle. For convex cost functions, our algorithm attains an optimal regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a CCV of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log T)$, matching the best-known projection-based results, while only using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({T})$ calls to the separation oracle. The results also demonstrate a tradeoff where lower calls to the separation oracle increase the regret and the CCV. In the strongly convex setting, we further achieve a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ and a CCV of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log T} )$, while requiring ${\mathcal{O}}({T}^2)$ calls to the separation oracle. Further, tradeoff with the decreasing oracle calls is studied. These results close the gap between projection-free and projection-based approaches, demonstrating that projection-free methods can achieve performance comparable to projection-based counterparts.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16763">Exact Learning of Permutations for Nonzero Binary Inputs with Logarithmic Training Size and Quadratic Ensemble Complexity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> George Giapitzakis, Artur Back de Luca, Kimon Fountoulakis</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability of an architecture to realize permutations is quite fundamental. For example, Large Language Models need to be able to correctly copy (and perhaps rearrange) parts of the input prompt into the output. Classical universal approximation theorems guarantee the existence of parameter configurations that solve this task but offer no insights into whether gradient-based algorithms can find them. In this paper, we address this gap by focusing on two-layer fully connected feed-forward neural networks and the task of learning permutations on nonzero binary inputs. We show that in the infinite width Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, an ensemble of such networks independently trained with gradient descent on only the $k$ standard basis vectors out of $2^k - 1$ possible inputs successfully learns any fixed permutation of length $k$ with arbitrarily high probability. By analyzing the exact training dynamics, we prove that the network's output converges to a Gaussian process whose mean captures the ground truth permutation via sign-based features. We then demonstrate how averaging these runs (an "ensemble" method) and applying a simple rounding step yields an arbitrarily accurate prediction on any possible input unseen during training. Notably, the number of models needed to achieve exact learning with high probability (which we refer to as ensemble complexity) exhibits a linearithmic dependence on the input size $k$ for a single test input and a quadratic dependence when considering all test inputs simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Kazemipour, Simone Parisi, Matthew E. Taylor, Michael Bowling</p>
<p>Abstract: A tenet of reinforcement learning is that rewards are always observed by the agent. However, this is not true in many realistic settings, e.g., a human observer may not always be able to provide rewards, a sensor to observe rewards may be limited or broken, or rewards may be unavailable during deployment. Monitored Markov decision processes (Mon-MDPs) have recently been proposed as a model of such settings. Yet, Mon-MDP algorithms developed thus far do not fully exploit the problem structure, cannot take advantage of a known monitor, have no worst-case guarantees for ``unsolvable'' Mon-MDPs without specific initialization, and only have asymptotic proofs of convergence. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce a model-based algorithm for Mon-MDPs that addresses all of these shortcomings. The algorithm uses two instances of model-based interval estimation, one to guarantee that observable rewards are indeed observed, and another to learn the optimal policy. Second, empirical results demonstrate these advantages, showing faster convergence than prior algorithms in over two dozen benchmark settings, and even more dramatic improvements when the monitor process is known. Third, we present the first finite-sample bound on performance and show convergence to an optimal worst-case policy when some rewards are never observable.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16778">The Robustness of Structural Features in Species Interaction Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanaz Hasanzadeh Fard, Emily Dolson</p>
<p>Abstract: Species interaction networks are a powerful tool for describing ecological communities; they typically contain nodes representing species, and edges representing interactions between those species. For the purposes of drawing abstract inferences about groups of similar networks, ecologists often use graph topology metrics to summarize structural features. However, gathering the data that underlies these networks is challenging, which can lead to some interactions being missed. Thus, it is important to understand how much different structural metrics are affected by missing data. To address this question, we analyzed a database of 148 real-world bipartite networks representing four different types of species interactions (pollination, host-parasite, plant-ant, and seed-dispersal). For each network, we measured six different topological properties: number of connected components, variance in node betweenness, variance in node PageRank, largest Eigenvalue, the number of non-zero Eigenvalues, and community detection as determined by four different algorithms. We then tested how these properties change as additional edges -- representing data that may have been missed -- are added to the networks. We found substantial variation in how robust different properties were to the missing data. For example, the Clauset-Newman-Moore and Louvain community detection algorithms showed much more gradual change as edges were added than the label propagation and Girvan-Newman algorithms did, suggesting that the former are more robust. Robustness also varied for some metrics based on interaction type. These results provide a foundation for selecting network properties to use when analyzing messy ecological network data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16782">CipherPrune: Efficient and Scalable Private Transformer Inference</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yancheng Zhang, Jiaqi Xue, Mengxin Zheng, Mimi Xie, Mingzhe Zhang, Lei Jiang, Qian Lou</p>
<p>Abstract: Private Transformer inference using cryptographic protocols offers promising solutions for privacy-preserving machine learning; however, it still faces significant runtime overhead (efficiency issues) and challenges in handling long-token inputs (scalability issues). We observe that the Transformer's operational complexity scales quadratically with the number of input tokens, making it essential to reduce the input token length. Notably, each token varies in importance, and many inputs contain redundant tokens. Additionally, prior private inference methods that rely on high-degree polynomial approximations for non-linear activations are computationally expensive. Therefore, reducing the polynomial degree for less important tokens can significantly accelerate private inference. Building on these observations, we propose \textit{CipherPrune}, an efficient and scalable private inference framework that includes a secure encrypted token pruning protocol, a polynomial reduction protocol, and corresponding Transformer network optimizations. At the protocol level, encrypted token pruning adaptively removes unimportant tokens from encrypted inputs in a progressive, layer-wise manner. Additionally, encrypted polynomial reduction assigns lower-degree polynomials to less important tokens after pruning, enhancing efficiency without decryption. At the network level, we introduce protocol-aware network optimization via a gradient-based search to maximize pruning thresholds and polynomial reduction conditions while maintaining the desired accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that CipherPrune reduces the execution overhead of private Transformer inference by approximately $6.1\times$ for 128-token inputs and $10.6\times$ for 512-token inputs, compared to previous methods, with only a marginal drop in accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noah Golowich, Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, Sham M. Kakade, Eran Malach</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models to predict beyond their training context lengths has drawn much attention in recent years, yet the principles driving such behavior of length generalization remain underexplored. We propose a new theoretical framework to study length generalization for the next-token prediction task, as performed by decoder-only transformers. Conceptually, we show that length generalization occurs as long as each predicted token depends on a small (fixed) number of previous tokens. We formalize such tasks via a notion we call $k$-sparse planted correlation distributions, and show that an idealized model of transformers which generalize attention heads successfully length-generalize on such tasks. As a bonus, our theoretical model justifies certain techniques to modify positional embeddings which have been introduced to improve length generalization, such as position coupling.
  We support our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic tasks and natural language, which confirm that a key factor driving length generalization is a ``sparse'' dependency structure of each token on the previous ones. Inspired by our theory, we introduce Predictive Position Coupling, which trains the transformer to predict the position IDs used in a positional coupling approach. Predictive Position Coupling thereby allows us to broaden the array of tasks to which position coupling can successfully be applied to achieve length generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Bin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their ability to learn representations from graph data. Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of interest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one another, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been developed. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade performance. However, it is a common problem that client nodes are often unlabeled in the realm of VGFL. Consequently, the existing attacks, which rely on the availability of labeling information to obtain gradients, are inherently constrained in their applicability. This limitation precludes their deployment in practical, real-world environments. To address the above problems, we propose a novel graph adversarial attack against VGFL, referred to as VGFL-SA, to degrade the performance of VGFL by modifying the local clients structure without using labels. Specifically, VGFL-SA uses a contrastive learning method to complete the attack before the local clients are trained. VGFL-SA first accesses the graph structure and node feature information of the poisoned clients, and generates the contrastive views by node-degree-based edge augmentation and feature shuffling augmentation. Then, VGFL-SA uses the shared graph encoder to get the embedding of each view, and the gradients of the adjacency matrices are obtained by the contrastive function. Finally, perturbed edges are generated using gradient modification rules. We validated the performance of VGFL-SA by performing a node classification task on real-world datasets, and the results show that VGFL-SA achieves good attack effectiveness and transferability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Standard language model evaluations can fail to capture risks that emerge only at deployment scale. For example, a model may produce safe responses during a small-scale beta test, yet reveal dangerous information when processing billions of requests at deployment. To remedy this, we introduce a method to forecast potential risks across orders of magnitude more queries than we test during evaluation. We make forecasts by studying each query's elicitation probability -- the probability the query produces a target behavior -- and demonstrate that the largest observed elicitation probabilities predictably scale with the number of queries. We find that our forecasts can predict the emergence of diverse undesirable behaviors -- such as assisting users with dangerous chemical synthesis or taking power-seeking actions -- across up to three orders of magnitude of query volume. Our work enables model developers to proactively anticipate and patch rare failures before they manifest during large-scale deployments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyu Wang, Mariam Avagyan, Yihan Shen, Arnaud Lamy, Tingran Wang, Szabolcs M\'arka, Zsuzsa M\'arka, John Wright</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned denoisers play a fundamental role in various signal generation (e.g., diffusion models) and reconstruction (e.g., compressed sensing) architectures, whose success derives from their ability to leverage low-dimensional structure in data. Existing denoising methods, however, either rely on local approximations that require a linear scan of the entire dataset or treat denoising as generic function approximation problems, often sacrificing efficiency and interpretability. We consider the problem of efficiently denoising a new noisy data point sampled from an unknown $d$-dimensional manifold $M \in \mathbb{R}^D$, using only noisy samples. This work proposes a framework for test-time efficient manifold denoising, by framing the concept of "learning-to-denoise" as "learning-to-optimize". We have two technical innovations: (i) online learning methods which learn to optimize over the manifold of clean signals using only noisy data, effectively "growing" an optimizer one sample at a time. (ii) mixed-order methods which guarantee that the learned optimizers achieve global optimality, ensuring both efficiency and near-optimal denoising performance. We corroborate these claims with theoretical analyses of both the complexity and denoising performance of mixed-order traversal. Our experiments on scientific manifolds demonstrate significantly improved complexity-performance tradeoffs compared to nearest neighbor search, which underpins existing provable denoising approaches based on exhaustive search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyoung Yun, Kiyoung Om, Jaewoo Lee, Sujin Yun, Jinkyoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional and complex black-box functions is crucial in numerous scientific applications. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for sample-efficient optimization, it struggles with the curse of dimensionality and scaling to thousands of evaluations. Recently, leveraging generative models to solve black-box optimization problems has emerged as a promising framework. However, those methods often underperform compared to BO methods due to limited expressivity and difficulty of uncertainty estimation in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome these issues, we introduce \textbf{DiBO}, a novel framework for solving high-dimensional black-box optimization problems. Our method iterates two stages. First, we train a diffusion model to capture the data distribution and an ensemble of proxies to predict function values with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection as a posterior inference problem to balance exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional spaces. Concretely, we fine-tune diffusion models to amortize posterior inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various synthetic and real-world black-box optimization tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Houji Jin, Negin Ashrafi, Kamiar Alaei, Elham Pishgar, Greg Placencia, Maryam Pishgar</p>
<p>Abstract: Sepsis is a major cause of ICU mortality, where early recognition and effective interventions are essential for improving patient outcomes. However, the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) varies dynamically with a patient's hemodynamic status, complicated by irregular medication patterns, missing data, and confounders, making sepsis prediction challenging. To address this, we propose a novel Teacher-Student multitask framework with self-supervised VIS pretraining via a Masked Autoencoder (MAE). The teacher model performs mortality classification and severity-score regression, while the student distills robust time-series representations, enhancing adaptation to heterogeneous VIS data. Compared to LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an AUROC of 0.82 on MIMIC-IV 3.0 (9,476 patients), outperforming the baseline (0.74). SHAP analysis revealed that SOFA score (0.147) had the greatest impact on ICU mortality, followed by LODS (0.033), single marital status (0.031), and Medicaid insurance (0.023), highlighting the role of sociodemographic factors. SAPSII (0.020) also contributed significantly. These findings suggest that both clinical and social factors should be considered in ICU decision-making. Our novel multitask and distillation strategies enable earlier identification of high-risk patients, improving prediction accuracy and disease management, offering new tools for ICU decision support.</p>

<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art data stream mining in supervised classification has traditionally relied on ensembles of incremental decision trees. However, the emergence of large tabular models, i.e., transformers designed for structured numerical data, marks a significant paradigm shift. These models move beyond traditional weight updates, instead employing in-context learning through prompt tuning. By using on-the-fly sketches to summarize unbounded streaming data, one can feed this information into a pre-trained model for efficient processing. This work bridges advancements from both areas, highlighting how transformers' implicit meta-learning abilities, pre-training on drifting natural data, and reliance on context optimization directly address the core challenges of adaptive learning in dynamic environments. Exploring real-time model adaptation, this research demonstrates that TabPFN, coupled with a simple sliding memory strategy, consistently outperforms ensembles of Hoeffding trees across all non-stationary benchmarks. Several promising research directions are outlined in the paper. The authors urge the community to explore these ideas, offering valuable opportunities to advance in-context stream learning.</p>

Many existing alignment approaches rely on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which assumes the existence of a ground-truth reward for each prompt-response pair. However, this assumption can be overly restrictive when modeling complex human preferences. In this paper, we drop the BT model assumption and study LLM alignment under general preferences, formulated as a two-player game. Drawing on theoretical insights from learning in games, we integrate optimistic online mirror descent into our alignment framework to approximate the Nash policy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an $O(T^{-1})$ bound on the duality gap, improving upon the previous $O(T^{-1/2})$ result. More importantly, we implement our method and show through experiments that it outperforms state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms across multiple representative benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) or kernel ridge regression is a widely used and powerful tool for nonlinear prediction. Therefore, active learning (AL) for GPR, which actively collects data labels to achieve an accurate prediction with fewer data labels, is an important problem. However, existing AL methods do not theoretically guarantee prediction accuracy for target distribution. Furthermore, as discussed in the distributionally robust learning literature, specifying the target distribution is often difficult. Thus, this paper proposes two AL methods that effectively reduce the worst-case expected error for GPR, which is the worst-case expectation in target distribution candidates. We show an upper bound of the worst-case expected squared error, which suggests that the error will be arbitrarily small by a finite number of data labels under mild conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoqi Yu, Yaoming Li, Juncheng Wang, Xiaoyu Guo, Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero, Tong Yang, Shujun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements have progressively incorporated frequency-based techniques into deep learning models, leading to notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency for time series analysis tasks. However, the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap in the real-world time series, where the energy is concentrated at the low-frequency region while the middle-frequency band is negligible, hinders the ability of existing deep learning models to extract the crucial frequency information. Additionally, the shared Key-Frequency in multivariate time series, where different time series share indistinguishable frequency patterns, is rarely exploited by existing literature. This work introduces a novel module, Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer, based on convolution and residual learning, to emphasize the significance of mid-frequency bands. We also propose an Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block to capture shared Key-Frequency, which achieves superior inter-series modeling performance with fewer parameters. A novel Key-Frequency Enhanced Training strategy is employed to further enhance Key-Frequency modeling, where spectral information from other channels is randomly introduced into each channel. Our approach advanced multivariate time series forecasting on the challenging Traffic, ECL, and Solar benchmarks, reducing MSE by 4%, 6%, and 5% compared to the previous SOTA iTransformer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaheng Li, Donghe Li, Ye Yang, Huan Xi, Yu Xiao, Li Sun, Dou An, Qingyu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems has increased the complexity and uncertainty of load forecasting, especially for integrated energy systems with multiple energy carriers. Traditional forecasting methods heavily rely on historical data and exhibit limited transferability across different scenarios, posing significant challenges for emerging applications in smart grids and energy internet. This paper proposes the TSLLM-Load Forecasting Mechanism, a novel zero-shot load forecasting framework based on large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. The framework consists of three key components: a data preprocessing module that handles multi-source energy load data, a time series prompt generation module that bridges the semantic gap between energy data and LLMs through multi-task learning and similarity alignment, and a prediction module that leverages pre-trained LLMs for accurate forecasting. The framework's effectiveness was validated on a real-world dataset comprising load profiles from 20 Australian solar-powered households, demonstrating superior performance in both conventional and zero-shot scenarios. In conventional testing, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4163 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3760, outperforming existing approaches by at least 8\%. In zero-shot prediction experiments across 19 households, the framework maintained consistent accuracy with a total MSE of 11.2712 and MAE of 7.6709, showing at least 12\% improvement over current methods. The results validate the framework's potential for accurate and transferable load forecasting in integrated energy systems, particularly beneficial for renewable energy integration and smart grid applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zewen Jin, Shengnan Wang, Jiaan Zhu, Hongrui Zhan, Youhui Bai, Lin Zhang, Zhenyu Ming, Cheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure scales the Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and improves their performance with only the sub-linear increase in computation resources. Recently, a fine-grained DeepSeekMoE structure is proposed, which can further improve the computing efficiency of MoE without performance degradation. However, the All-to-All communication introduced by MoE has become a bottleneck, especially for the fine-grained structure, which typically involves and activates more experts, hence contributing to heavier communication overhead.
  In this paper, we propose a novel MoE structure named BigMac, which is also fine-grained but with high communication efficiency. The innovation of BigMac is mainly due to that we abandon the \textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{d}escend-\textbf{a}scend-\textbf{c}ommunicate (CDAC) manner used by fine-grained MoE, which leads to the All-to-All communication always taking place at the highest dimension. Instead, BigMac designs an efficient \textbf{d}escend-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{a}scend (DCCA) manner. Specifically, we add a descending and ascending projection at the entrance and exit of the expert, respectively, which enables the communication to perform at a very low dimension. Furthermore, to adapt to DCCA, we re-design the structure of small experts, ensuring that the expert in BigMac has enough complexity to address tokens. Experimental results show that BigMac achieves comparable or even better model quality than fine-grained MoEs with the same number of experts and a similar number of total parameters. Equally importantly, BigMac reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 3.09$\times$ for training and increases the throughput by up to 3.11$\times$ for inference on state-of-the-art AI computing frameworks including Megatron, Tutel, and DeepSpeed-Inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vidhi Rathore, Naresh Manwani</p>
<p>Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used method for dimensionality reduction, but it often overlooks fairness, especially when working with data that includes demographic characteristics. This can lead to biased representations that disproportionately affect certain groups. To address this issue, our approach incorporates Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition (JEVD), a technique that enables the simultaneous diagonalization of multiple matrices, ensuring fair and efficient representations. We formally show that the optimal solution of JEVD leads to a fair PCA solution. By integrating JEVD with PCA, we strike an optimal balance between preserving data structure and promoting fairness across diverse groups. We demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline approaches in fairness and representational quality on various datasets. It retains the core advantages of PCA while ensuring that sensitive demographic attributes do not create disparities in the reduced representation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannick W\"olker, Christian Beth, Matthias Renz, Arne Biastoch</p>
<p>Abstract: Mining spatio-temporal correlation patterns for traffic prediction is a well-studied field. However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghua Huang, Lu Wang, Fangkai Yang, Pu Zhao, Zhixu Li, Qingwei Lin, Dongmei Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. It requires joint training of an actor and critic with a pretrained, fixed reward model for guidance. This approach increases computational complexity and instability due to actor-critic interdependence. Additionally, PPO lacks access to true environment rewards in LLM tasks, limiting its adaptability. Under such conditions, pretraining a value model or a reward model becomes equivalent, as both provide fixed supervisory signals without new ground-truth feedback. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Decoupled Value Policy Optimization (DVPO)}, a lean framework that replaces traditional reward modeling with a pretrained \emph{global value model (GVM)}. The GVM is conditioned on policy trajectories and predicts token-level return-to-go estimates. By decoupling value model from policy training (via frozen GVM-driven RL objectives), DVPO eliminates actor-critic interdependence, reducing GPU memory usage by 40\% and training time by 35\% compared to conventional RLHF. Experiments across benchmarks show DVPO outperforms efficient RLHF methods (e.g., DPO) while matching state-of-the-art PPO in performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16947">Using Machine Learning to Detect Fraudulent SMSs in Chichewa</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Amelia Taylor, Amoss Robert</p>
<p>Abstract: SMS enabled fraud is of great concern globally. Building classifiers based on machine learning for SMS fraud requires the use of suitable datasets for model training and validation. Most research has centred on the use of datasets of SMSs in English. This paper introduces a first dataset for SMS fraud detection in Chichewa, a major language in Africa, and reports on experiments with machine learning algorithms for classifying SMSs in Chichewa as fraud or non-fraud. We answer the broader research question of how feasible it is to develop machine learning classification models for Chichewa SMSs. To do that, we created three datasets. A small dataset of SMS in Chichewa was collected through primary research from a segment of the young population. We applied a label-preserving text transformations to increase its size. The enlarged dataset was translated into English using two approaches: human translation and machine translation. The Chichewa and the translated datasets were subjected to machine classification using random forest and logistic regression. Our findings indicate that both models achieved a promising accuracy of over 96% on the Chichewa dataset. There was a drop in performance when moving from the Chichewa to the translated dataset. This highlights the importance of data preprocessing, especially in multilingual or cross-lingual NLP tasks, and shows the challenges of relying on machine-translated text for training machine learning models. Our results underscore the importance of developing language specific models for SMS fraud detection to optimise accuracy and performance. Since most machine learning models require data preprocessing, it is essential to investigate the impact of the reliance on English-specific tools for data preprocessing.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16948">Deep Minimax Classifiers for Imbalanced Datasets with a Small Number of Minority Samples</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hansung Choi, Daewon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of a minimax classifier is well-established in statistical decision theory, but its implementation via neural networks remains challenging, particularly in scenarios with imbalanced training data having a limited number of samples for minority classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel minimax learning algorithm designed to minimize the risk of worst-performing classes. Our algorithm iterates through two steps: a minimization step that trains the model based on a selected target prior, and a maximization step that updates the target prior towards the adversarial prior for the trained model. In the minimization, we introduce a targeted logit-adjustment loss function that efficiently identifies optimal decision boundaries under the target prior. Moreover, based on a new prior-dependent generalization bound that we obtained, we theoretically prove that our loss function has a better generalization capability than existing loss functions. During the maximization, we refine the target prior by shifting it towards the adversarial prior, depending on the worst-performing classes rather than on per-class risk estimates. Our maximization method is particularly robust in the regime of a small number of samples. Additionally, to adapt to overparameterized neural networks, we partition the entire training dataset into two subsets: one for model training during the minimization step and the other for updating the target prior during the maximization step. Our proposed algorithm has a provable convergence property, and empirical results indicate that our algorithm performs better than or is comparable to existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Saidul Hoque Anik, Ariful Azad</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) learning offers a powerful framework for generating new knowledge and making inferences. Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can also be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longlong Li, Cunquan Qu, Guanghui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting smartphone app usage patterns is crucial for user experience optimization and targeted marketing. However, existing methods struggle to capture intricate dependencies in user behavior, particularly in sparse or complex usage scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce Atten-Transformer, a novel model that integrates temporal attention with a Transformer network to dynamically identify and leverage key app usage patterns. Unlike conventional methods that primarily consider app order and duration, our approach employs a multi-dimensional feature representation, incorporating both feature encoding and temporal encoding to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed attention mechanism effectively assigns importance to critical app usage moments, improving both model interpretability and generalization. Extensive experiments on multiple smartphone usage datasets, including LSapp and Tsinghua App Usage datasets, demonstrate that Atten-Transformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across different data splits. Specifically, our model achieves a 45.24\% improvement in HR@1 on the Tsinghua dataset (Time-based Split) and a 18.25\% improvement in HR@1 on the LSapp dataset (Cold Start Split), showcasing its robustness across diverse app usage scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of integrating adaptive attention mechanisms in mobile usage forecasting, paving the way for enhanced user engagement and resource allocation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, the Muon optimizer based on matrix orthogonalization has demonstrated strong results in training small-scale language models, but the scalability to larger models has not been proven. We identify two crucial techniques for scaling up Muon: (1) adding weight decay and (2) carefully adjusting the per-parameter update scale. These techniques allow Muon to work out-of-the-box on large-scale training without the need of hyper-parameter tuning. Scaling law experiments indicate that Muon achieves $\sim\!2\times$ computational efficiency compared to AdamW with compute optimal training.
  Based on these improvements, we introduce Moonlight, a 3B/16B-parameter Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model trained with 5.7T tokens using Muon. Our model improves the current Pareto frontier, achieving better performance with much fewer training FLOPs compared to prior models.
  We open-source our distributed Muon implementation that is memory optimal and communication efficient. We also release the pretrained, instruction-tuned, and intermediate checkpoints to support future research.</p>

We attempt to bridge this gap by introducing FADE: Feature Alignment to Description Evaluation, a scalable model-agnostic framework for evaluating feature-description alignment. FADE evaluates alignment across four key metrics - Clarity, Responsiveness, Purity, and Faithfulness - and systematically quantifies the causes for the misalignment of feature and their description. We apply FADE to analyze existing open-source feature descriptions, and assess key components of automated interpretability pipelines, aiming to enhance the quality of descriptions. Our findings highlight fundamental challenges in generating feature descriptions, particularly for SAEs as compared to MLP neurons, providing insights into the limitations and future directions of automated interpretability.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deep neural networks has brought increased attention to the security and robustness of these models. While existing adversarial attack algorithms have demonstrated success in improving adversarial transferability, their performance remains suboptimal due to a lack of consideration for the discrepancies between target and source models. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method, Inverse Knowledge Distillation (IKD), designed to enhance adversarial transferability effectively. IKD introduces a distillation-inspired loss function that seamlessly integrates with gradient-based attack methods, promoting diversity in attack gradients and mitigating overfitting to specific model architectures. By diversifying gradients, IKD enables the generation of adversarial samples with superior generalization capabilities across different models, significantly enhancing their effectiveness in black-box attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in the transferability and attack success rates of adversarial samples across a wide range of models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This position paper argues that, to its detriment, transparency research overlooks many foundational concepts of artificial intelligence. Here, we focus on uncertainty quantification -- in the context of ante-hoc interpretability and counterfactual explainability -- showing how its adoption could address key challenges in the field. First, we posit that uncertainty and ante-hoc interpretability offer complementary views of the same underlying idea; second, we assert that uncertainty provides a principled unifying framework for counterfactual explainability. Consequently, inherently transparent models can benefit from human-centred explanatory insights -- like counterfactuals -- which are otherwise missing. At a higher level, integrating artificial intelligence fundamentals into transparency research promises to yield more reliable, robust and understandable predictive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enea Monzio Compagnoni, Rustem Islamov, Frank Norbert Proske, Aurelien Lucchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed methods are essential for handling machine learning pipelines comprising large-scale models and datasets. However, their benefits often come at the cost of increased communication overhead between the central server and agents, which can become the main bottleneck, making training costly or even unfeasible in such systems. Compression methods such as quantization and sparsification can alleviate this issue. Still, their robustness to large and heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon sometimes observed in language modeling, remains poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by analyzing Distributed Compressed SGD (DCSGD) and Distributed SignSGD (DSignSGD) using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our results show that DCSGD with unbiased compression is more vulnerable to noise in stochastic gradients, while DSignSGD remains robust, even under large and heavy-tailed noise. Additionally, we propose new scaling rules for hyperparameter tuning to mitigate performance degradation due to compression. These findings are empirically validated across multiple deep learning architectures and datasets, providing practical recommendations for distributed optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale physical systems defined on irregular grids pose significant scalability challenges for deep learning methods, especially in the presence of long-range interactions and multi-scale coupling. Traditional approaches that compute all pairwise interactions, such as attention, become computationally prohibitive as they scale quadratically with the number of nodes. We present Erwin, a hierarchical transformer inspired by methods from computational many-body physics, which combines the efficiency of tree-based algorithms with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Erwin employs ball tree partitioning to organize computation, which enables linear-time attention by processing nodes in parallel within local neighborhoods of fixed size. Through progressive coarsening and refinement of the ball tree structure, complemented by a novel cross-ball interaction mechanism, it captures both fine-grained local details and global features. We demonstrate Erwin's effectiveness across multiple domains, including cosmology, molecular dynamics, and particle fluid dynamics, where it consistently outperforms baseline methods both in accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

Inspired by bioinformatics, this study examines how the nature of clusters varies with cluster number, presenting a method for determining cluster robustness, and providing a systematic method for deciding on the cluster number. The study focuses specifically on short-text clustering, involving 30,000 political Twitter bios, where the sparse co-occurrence of words between texts makes finding meaningful clusters challenging. A metric of proportional stability is introduced to uncover the stability of specific clusters between cluster resolutions, and the results are visualised using Sankey diagrams to provide an interrogative tool for understanding the nature of the dataset. The visualisation provides an intuitive way to track cluster subdivision and reorganisation as cluster number increases, offering insights that static, single-resolution metrics cannot capture. The results show that instead of seeking a single 'optimal' solution, choosing a cluster number involves balancing informativeness and complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gregor Baer, Isel Grau, Chao Zhang, Pieter Van Gorp</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in time series applications, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are essential for understanding their predictions. Within XAI, feature attribution methods aim to identify which input features contributed the most to a model's prediction, with their evaluation typically relying on perturbation-based metrics. Through empirical analysis across multiple datasets, model architectures, and perturbation strategies, we identify important class-dependent effects in these metrics: they show varying effectiveness across classes, achieving strong results for some while remaining less sensitive to others. In particular, we find that the most effective perturbation strategies often demonstrate the most pronounced class differences. Our analysis suggests that these effects arise from the learned biases of classifiers, indicating that perturbation-based evaluation may reflect specific model behaviors rather than intrinsic attribution quality. We propose an evaluation framework with a class-aware penalty term to help assess and account for these effects in evaluating feature attributions. Although our analysis focuses on time series classification, these class-dependent effects likely extend to other structured data domains where perturbation-based evaluation is common.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boris Kriuk</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern fire management systems increasingly rely on satellite data and weather forecasting; however, access to comprehensive datasets remains limited due to proprietary restrictions. Despite the ecological significance of wildfires, large-scale, multi-regional research is constrained by data scarcity. Russian diverse ecosystems play a crucial role in shaping Eurasian fire dynamics, yet they remain underexplored. This study addresses existing gaps by introducing an open-access dataset that captures detailed fire incidents alongside corresponding meteorological conditions. We present one of the most extensive datasets available for wildfire analysis in Russia, covering 13 consecutive months of observations. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we conduct exploratory data analysis and develop predictive models to identify key fire behavior patterns across different fire categories and ecosystems. Our results highlight the critical influence of environmental factor patterns on fire occurrence and spread behavior. By improving the understanding of wildfire dynamics in Eurasia, this work contributes to more effective, data-driven approaches for proactive fire management in the face of evolving environmental conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenzhe Yin, Zehao Xiao, Pan Zhou, Shujian Yu, Jiayi Shen, Jan-Jakob Sonke, Efstratios Gavves</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal alignment is crucial for various downstream tasks such as cross-modal generation and retrieval. Previous multimodal approaches like CLIP maximize the mutual information mainly by aligning pairwise samples across modalities while overlooking the distributional differences, leading to suboptimal alignment with modality gaps. In this paper, to overcome the limitation, we propose CS-Aligner, a novel and straightforward framework that performs distributional vision-language alignment by integrating Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence with mutual information. In the proposed framework, we find that the CS divergence and mutual information serve complementary roles in multimodal alignment, capturing both the global distribution information of each modality and the pairwise semantic relationships, yielding tighter and more precise alignment. Moreover, CS-Aligher enables incorporating additional information from unpaired data and token-level representations, enhancing flexible and fine-grained alignment in practice. Experiments on text-to-image generation and cross-modality retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on vision-language alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianjin Huang, Haotian Hu, Zhenyu Zhang, Gaojie Jin, Xiang Li, Li Shen, Tianlong Chen, Lu Liu, Qingsong Wen, Zhangyang Wang, Shiwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper comprehensively evaluates several recently proposed optimizers for 4-bit training, revealing that low-bit precision amplifies sensitivity to learning rates and often causes unstable gradient norms, leading to divergence at higher learning rates. Among these, SPAM, a recent optimizer featuring momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping, achieves the best performance across various bit levels, but struggles to stabilize gradient norms, requiring careful learning rate tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Stable-SPAM, which incorporates enhanced gradient normalization and clipping techniques. In particular, Stable-SPAM (1) adaptively updates the clipping threshold for spiked gradients by tracking their historical maxima; (2) normalizes the entire gradient matrix based on its historical $l_2$-norm statistics; and $(3)$ inherits momentum reset from SPAM to periodically reset the first and second moments of Adam, mitigating the accumulation of spiked gradients. Extensive experiments show that Stable-SPAM effectively stabilizes gradient norms in 4-bit LLM training, delivering superior performance compared to Adam and SPAM. Notably, our 4-bit LLaMA-1B model trained with Stable-SPAM outperforms the BF16 LLaMA-1B trained with Adam by up to $2$ perplexity. Furthermore, when both models are trained in 4-bit, Stable-SPAM achieves the same loss as Adam while requiring only about half the training steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Loizou, Dimitrios Tsoumakos</p>
<p>Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting the highest quality data for analysis highly increases task accuracy and efficiency, it is still a hard task, especially when the number of available inputs is very large. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from datasets similar to the queried one. Dataset similarity is performed via projecting each dataset to a vector embedding representation. The vectorization process is performed using our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, which takes a whole dataset and projects it into a lower vector embedding representation space. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation and distinguish between them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Wang, Juan C. Alfaro, Viktor Bengs</p>
<p>Abstract: The \textit{label ranking} problem is a supervised learning scenario in which the learner predicts a \textit{total order} of the class labels for a given input instance. Recently, research has increasingly focused on the \textit{partial label ranking} problem, a generalization of the label ranking problem that allows \textit{ties} in the predicted orders. So far, most existing learning approaches for the partial label ranking problem rely on approximation algorithms for rank aggregation in the final prediction step. This paper explores several alternative aggregation methods for this critical step, including scoring-based and probabilistic-based rank aggregation approaches. To enhance their suitability for the more general partial label ranking problem, the investigated methods are extended to increase the likelihood of producing ties. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that scoring-based variants consistently outperform the current state-of-the-art method in handling incomplete information. In contrast, probabilistic-based variants fail to achieve competitive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linian Wang, Leye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy concerns in machine learning are heightened by regulations such as the GDPR, which enforces the "right to be forgotten" (RTBF), driving the emergence of machine unlearning as a critical research field. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative model training by aggregating a sample's features across distributed parties while preserving data privacy at each source. This paradigm has seen widespread adoption in healthcare, finance, and other privacy-sensitive domains. However, existing VFL systems lack robust mechanisms to comply with RTBF requirements, as unlearning methodologies for VFL remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first VFL framework with theoretically guaranteed unlearning capabilities, enabling the removal of any data at any time. Unlike prior approaches -- which impose restrictive assumptions on model architectures or data types for removal -- our solution is model- and data-agnostic, offering universal compatibility. Moreover, our framework supports asynchronous unlearning, eliminating the need for all parties to be simultaneously online during the forgetting process. These advancements address critical gaps in current VFL systems, ensuring compliance with RTBF while maintaining operational flexibility.We make all our implementations publicly available at https://github.com/wangln19/vertical-federated-unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Wang, Mingyang Yi, Shuchen Xue, Zhenguo Li, Ming Liu, Bing Qin, Zhi-Ming Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved significant success in generative tasks. However, their training and sampling processes suffer from the issue of distribution mismatch. During the denoising process, the input data distributions differ between the training and inference stages, potentially leading to inaccurate data generation. To obviate this, we analyze the training objective of DPMs and theoretically demonstrate that this mismatch can be alleviated through Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which is equivalent to performing robustness-driven Adversarial Training (AT) on DPMs. Furthermore, for the recently proposed Consistency Model (CM), which distills the inference process of the DPM, we prove that its training objective also encounters the mismatch issue. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by AT as well. Based on these insights, we propose to conduct efficient AT on both DPM and CM. Finally, extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of AT in diffusion-based models. The code is available at https://github.com/kugwzk/AT_Diff.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the exceptional performance of generative models in generative tasks has sparked significant interest in their integration into decision-making processes. Due to their ability to handle complex data distributions and their strong model capacity, generative models can be effectively incorporated into decision-making systems by generating trajectories that guide agents toward high-reward state-action regions or intermediate sub-goals. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of generative models in decision-making tasks. We classify seven fundamental types of generative models: energy-based models, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, diffusion models, generative flow networks, and autoregressive models. Regarding their applications, we categorize their functions into three main roles: controllers, modelers and optimizers, and discuss how each role contributes to decision-making. Furthermore, we examine the deployment of these models across five critical real-world decision-making scenarios. Finally, we summarize the strengths and limitations of current approaches and propose three key directions for advancing next-generation generative directive models: high-performance algorithms, large-scale generalized decision-making models, and self-evolving and adaptive models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, generative models have achieved remarkable performance across diverse applications, including image generation, text synthesis, audio creation, video generation, and data augmentation. Diffusion models have emerged as superior alternatives to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by addressing their limitations, such as training instability, mode collapse, and poor representation of multimodal distributions. This success has spurred widespread research interest. In the domain of tabular data, diffusion models have begun to showcase similar advantages over GANs and VAEs, achieving significant performance breakthroughs and demonstrating their potential for addressing unique challenges in tabular data modeling. However, while domains like images and time series have numerous surveys summarizing advancements in diffusion models, there remains a notable gap in the literature for tabular data. Despite the increasing interest in diffusion models for tabular data, there has been little effort to systematically review and summarize these developments. This lack of a dedicated survey limits a clear understanding of the challenges, progress, and future directions in this critical area. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of diffusion models for tabular data. Covering works from June 2015, when diffusion models emerged, to December 2024, we analyze nearly all relevant studies, with updates maintained in a \href{https://github.com/Diffusion-Model-Leiden/awesome-diffusion-models-for-tabular-data}{GitHub repository}. Assuming readers possess foundational knowledge of statistics and diffusion models, we employ mathematical formulations to deliver a rigorous and detailed review, aiming to promote developments in this emerging and exciting area.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17121">Adversarial Training for Defense Against Label Poisoning Attacks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Melis Ilayda Bal, Volkan Cevher, Michael Muehlebach</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning models grow in complexity and increasingly rely on publicly sourced data, such as the human-annotated labels used in training large language models, they become more vulnerable to label poisoning attacks. These attacks, in which adversaries subtly alter the labels within a training dataset, can severely degrade model performance, posing significant risks in critical applications. In this paper, we propose FLORAL, a novel adversarial training defense strategy based on support vector machines (SVMs) to counter these threats. Utilizing a bilevel optimization framework, we cast the training process as a non-zero-sum Stackelberg game between an attacker, who strategically poisons critical training labels, and the model, which seeks to recover from such attacks. Our approach accommodates various model architectures and employs a projected gradient descent algorithm with kernel SVMs for adversarial training. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithm's convergence properties and empirically evaluate FLORAL's effectiveness across diverse classification tasks. Compared to robust baselines and foundation models such as RoBERTa, FLORAL consistently achieves higher robust accuracy under increasing attacker budgets. These results underscore the potential of FLORAL to enhance the resilience of machine learning models against label poisoning threats, thereby ensuring robust classification in adversarial settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laura Selicatoa, Flavia Esposito, Andersen Ang, Nicoletta Del Buono, Rafal Zdunek</p>
<p>Abstract: The selection of penalty hyperparameters is a critical aspect in Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), since these values control the trade-off between the reconstruction accuracy and the adherence to desired constraints. In this work, we focus on an NMF problem involving the Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence, effective for extracting low spectral density components from spectrograms of mixed signals, enhanced with sparsity constraints. We propose a new algorithm called SHINBO, which introduces a bi-level optimization framework to automatically and adaptively tune the row-dependent penalty hyperparameters, enhancing the ability of IS-NMF to isolate sparse, periodic signals against noise. Experimental results showed SHINBO ensures precise spectral decomposition and demonstrates superior performance in both synthetic and real-world applications. For the latter, SHINBO is particularly useful, as noninvasive vibration-based fault detection in rolling bearings, where the desired signal components often reside in high-frequency subbands but are obscured by stronger, spectrally broader noise. By addressing the critical issue of hyperparameter selection, SHINBO advances the state-of-the-art in signal recovery for complex, noise-dominated environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max van Spengler, Pascal Mettes</p>
<p>Abstract: Embedding tree-like data, from hierarchies to ontologies and taxonomies, forms a well-studied problem for representing knowledge across many domains. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural solution for embedding trees, with vastly superior performance over Euclidean embeddings. Recent literature has shown that hyperbolic tree embeddings can even be placed on top of neural networks for hierarchical knowledge integration in deep learning settings. For all applications, a faithful embedding of trees is needed, with combinatorial constructions emerging as the most effective direction. This paper identifies and solves two key limitations of existing works. First, the combinatorial construction hinges on finding highly separated points on a hypersphere, a notoriously difficult problem. Current approaches achieve poor separation, degrading the quality of the corresponding hyperbolic embedding. We propose highly separated Delaunay tree embeddings (HS-DTE), which integrates angular separation in a generalized formulation of Delaunay embeddings, leading to lower embedding distortion. Second, low-distortion requires additional precision. The current approach for increasing precision is to use multiple precision arithmetic, which renders the embeddings useless on GPUs in deep learning settings. We reformulate the combinatorial construction using floating point expansion arithmetic, leading to superior embedding quality while retaining utility on accelerated hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Havrilla, David Alvarez-Melis, Nicolo Fusi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models ($\textbf{LLMs}$) have emerged as a powerful method for discovery. Instead of utilizing numerical data, LLMs utilize associated variable $\textit{semantic metadata}$ to predict variable relationships. Simultaneously, LLMs demonstrate impressive abilities to act as black-box optimizers when given an objective $f$ and sequence of trials. We study LLMs at the intersection of these two capabilities by applying LLMs to the task of $\textit{interactive graph discovery}$: given a ground truth graph $G^*$ capturing variable relationships and a budget of $I$ edge experiments over $R$ rounds, minimize the distance between the predicted graph $\hat{G}_R$ and $G^*$ at the end of the $R$-th round. To solve this task we propose $\textbf{IGDA}$, a LLM-based pipeline incorporating two key components: 1) an LLM uncertainty-driven method for edge experiment selection 2) a local graph update strategy utilizing binary feedback from experiments to improve predictions for unselected neighboring edges. Experiments on eight different real-world graphs show our approach often outperforms all baselines including a state-of-the-art numerical method for interactive graph discovery. Further, we conduct a rigorous series of ablations dissecting the impact of each pipeline component. Finally, to assess the impact of memorization, we apply our interactive graph discovery strategy to a complex, new (as of July 2024) causal graph on protein transcription factors, finding strong performance in a setting where memorization is impossible. Overall, our results show IGDA to be a powerful method for graph discovery complementary to existing numerically driven approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformer models typically calculate attention matrices using dot products, which have limitations when capturing nonlinear relationships between embedding vectors. We propose Neural Attention, a technique that replaces dot products with feed-forward networks, enabling a more expressive representation of relationships between tokens. This approach modifies only the attention matrix calculation while preserving the matrix dimensions, making it easily adaptable to existing transformer-based architectures. We provide a detailed mathematical justification for why Neural Attention increases representational capacity and conduct controlled experiments to validate this claim. When comparing Neural Attention and Dot-Product Attention, NLP experiments on WikiText-103 show a reduction in perplexity of over 5 percent. Similarly, experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show comparable improvements for image classification tasks. While Neural Attention introduces higher computational demands, we develop techniques to mitigate these challenges, ensuring practical usability without sacrificing the increased expressivity it provides. This work establishes Neural Attention as an effective means of enhancing the predictive capabilities of transformer models across a variety of applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ratun Rahman, Pablo Moriano, Samee U. Khan, Dinh C. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Electric load forecasting is essential for power management and stability in smart grids. This is mainly achieved via advanced metering infrastructure, where smart meters (SMs) record household energy data. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods are often employed for load forecasting but require data sharing which raises data privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) can address this issue by running distributed ML models at local SMs without data exchange. However, current FL-based approaches struggle to achieve efficient load forecasting due to imbalanced data distribution across heterogeneous SMs. This paper presents a novel personalized federated learning (PFL) method for high-quality load forecasting in metering networks. A meta-learning-based strategy is developed to address data heterogeneity at local SMs in the collaborative training of local load forecasting models. Moreover, to minimize the load forecasting delays in our PFL model, we study a new latency optimization problem based on optimal resource allocation at SMs. A theoretical convergence analysis is also conducted to provide insights into FL design for federated load forecasting. Extensive simulations from real-world datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of better load forecasting and reduced operational latency costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shikha Surana, Nathan Grinsztajn, Timothy Atkinson, Paul Duckworth, Thomas D. Barrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning methods can automate the in silico design of biological sequences, aiming to reduce costs and accelerate medical research. Given the limited access to wet labs, in silico design methods commonly use an oracle model to evaluate de novo generated sequences. However, the use of different oracle models across methods makes it challenging to compare them reliably, motivating the question: are in silico sequence design benchmarks reliable? In this work, we examine 12 sequence design methods that utilise ML oracles common in the literature and find that there are significant challenges with their cross-consistency and reproducibility. Indeed, oracles differing by architecture, or even just training seed, are shown to yield conflicting relative performance with our analysis suggesting poor out-of-distribution generalisation as a key issue. To address these challenges, we propose supplementing the evaluation with a suite of biophysical measures to assess the viability of generated sequences and limit out-of-distribution sequences the oracle is required to score, thereby improving the robustness of the design procedure. Our work aims to highlight potential pitfalls in the current evaluation process and contribute to the development of robust benchmarks, ultimately driving the improvement of in silico design methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simon Geisler, Tom Wollschl\"ager, M. H. I. Abdalla, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Johannes Gasteiger, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: To circumvent the alignment of large language models (LLMs), current optimization-based adversarial attacks usually craft adversarial prompts by maximizing the likelihood of a so-called affirmative response. An affirmative response is a manually designed start of a harmful answer to an inappropriate request. While it is often easy to craft prompts that yield a substantial likelihood for the affirmative response, the attacked model frequently does not complete the response in a harmful manner. Moreover, the affirmative objective is usually not adapted to model-specific preferences and essentially ignores the fact that LLMs output a distribution over responses. If low attack success under such an objective is taken as a measure of robustness, the true robustness might be grossly overestimated. To alleviate these flaws, we propose an adaptive and semantic optimization problem over the population of responses. We derive a generally applicable objective via the REINFORCE policy-gradient formalism and demonstrate its efficacy with the state-of-the-art jailbreak algorithms Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). For example, our objective doubles the attack success rate (ASR) on Llama3 and increases the ASR from 2% to 50% with circuit breaker defense.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with coverage guarantees. Classical methods, such as split conformal prediction, provide marginal coverage, ensuring that the prediction set contains the label of a random test point with a target probability. However, these guarantees may not hold uniformly across different subpopulations, leading to disparities in coverage. Prior work has explored coverage guarantees conditioned on events related to the covariates and label of the test point. We present Kandinsky conformal prediction, a framework that significantly expands the scope of conditional coverage guarantees. In contrast to Mondrian conformal prediction, which restricts its coverage guarantees to disjoint groups -- reminiscent of the rigid, structured grids of Piet Mondrian's art -- our framework flexibly handles overlapping and fractional group memberships defined jointly on covariates and labels, reflecting the layered, intersecting forms in Wassily Kandinsky's compositions. Our algorithm unifies and extends existing methods, encompassing covariate-based group conditional, class conditional, and Mondrian conformal prediction as special cases, while achieving a minimax-optimal high-probability conditional coverage bound. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach through empirical evaluation on real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiao Wen, Yanjun Han, Zhengyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We study regret minimization in repeated first-price auctions (FPAs), where a bidder observes only the realized outcome after each auction -- win or loss. This setup reflects practical scenarios in online display advertising where the actual value of an impression depends on the difference between two potential outcomes, such as clicks or conversion rates, when the auction is won versus lost. We analyze three outcome models: (1) adversarial outcomes without features, (2) linear potential outcomes with features, and (3) linear treatment effects in features. For each setting, we propose algorithms that jointly estimate private values and optimize bidding strategies, achieving near-optimal regret bounds. Notably, our framework enjoys a unique feature that the treatments are also actively chosen, and hence eliminates the need for the overlap condition commonly required in causal inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Gu, Wei Li, Lujun Li, Qiyuan Zhu, Mark Lee, Shengjie Sun, Wei Xue, Yike Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs) achieve exceptional performance, but face prohibitive storage and memory requirements. To address these challenges, we present $D^2$-MoE, a new delta decompression compressor for reducing the parameters of MoE LLMs. Based on observations of expert diversity, we decompose their weights into a shared base weight and unique delta weights. Specifically, our method first merges each expert's weight into the base weight using the Fisher information matrix to capture shared components. Then, we compress delta weights through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) by exploiting their low-rank properties. Finally, we introduce a semi-dynamical structured pruning strategy for the base weights, combining static and dynamic redundancy analysis to achieve further parameter reduction while maintaining input adaptivity. In this way, our $D^2$-MoE successfully compact MoE LLMs to high compression ratios without additional training. Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of our approach, with over 13% performance gains than other compressors on Mixtral|Phi-3.5|DeepSeek|Qwen2 MoE LLMs at 40$\sim$60% compression rates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jichen Li, Lijia Xie, Hanting Huang, Bo Zhou, Binfeng Song, Wanying Zeng, Xiaotie Deng, Xiao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Strategic mining attacks, such as selfish mining, exploit blockchain consensus protocols by deviating from honest behavior to maximize rewards. Markov Decision Process (MDP) analysis faces scalability challenges in modern digital economics, including blockchain. To address these limitations, reinforcement learning (RL) provides a scalable alternative, enabling adaptive strategy optimization in complex dynamic environments.
  In this survey, we examine RL's role in strategic mining analysis, comparing it to MDP-based approaches. We begin by reviewing foundational MDP models and their limitations, before exploring RL frameworks that can learn near-optimal strategies across various protocols. Building on this analysis, we compare RL techniques and their effectiveness in deriving security thresholds, such as the minimum attacker power required for profitable attacks. Expanding the discussion further, we classify consensus protocols and propose open challenges, such as multi-agent dynamics and real-world validation.
  This survey highlights the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of selfish mining, including protocol design, threat detection, and security analysis, while offering a strategic roadmap for researchers in decentralized systems and AI-driven analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Dooms, Daniel Wilhelm</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) have become a prevalent tool for interpreting language models' inner workings. However, it is unknown how tightly SAE features correspond to computationally important directions in the model. This work empirically shows that many RES-JB SAE features predominantly correspond to simple input statistics. We hypothesize this is caused by a large class imbalance in training data combined with a lack of complex error signals. To reduce this behavior, we propose a method that disentangles token reconstruction from feature reconstruction. This improvement is achieved by introducing a per-token bias, which provides an enhanced baseline for interesting reconstruction. As a result, significantly more interesting features and improved reconstruction in sparse regimes are learned.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore the low-rank structure of the weight matrices in neural networks originating from training with Gradient Descent (GD) and Gradient Flow (GF) with $L2$ regularization (also known as weight decay). We show several properties of GD-trained deep neural networks, induced by $L2$ regularization. In particular, for a stationary point of GD we show alignment of the parameters and the gradient, norm preservation across layers, and low-rank bias: properties previously known in the context of GF solutions. Experiments show that the assumptions made in the analysis only mildly affect the observations. In addition, we investigate a multitask learning phenomenon enabled by $L2$ regularization and low-rank bias. In particular, we show that if two networks are trained, such that the inputs in the training set of one network are approximately orthogonal to the inputs in the training set of the other network, the new network obtained by simply summing the weights of the two networks will perform as well on both training sets as the respective individual networks. We demonstrate this for shallow ReLU neural networks trained by GD, as well as deep linear and deep ReLU networks trained by GF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Pedro Matos-Carvalho, Stefano Frizzo Stefenon, Valderi Reis Quietinho Leithardt, Kin-Choong Yow</p>
<p>Abstract: Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rosie Zhao, Tian Qin, David Alvarez-Melis, Sham Kakade, Naomi Saphra</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the nature of sudden breakthroughs in language model performance at scale, which stands in contrast to smooth improvements governed by scaling laws. While advocates of "emergence" view abrupt performance gains as capabilities unlocking at specific scales, others have suggested that they are produced by thresholding effects and alleviated by continuous metrics. We propose that breakthroughs are instead driven by continuous changes in the probability distribution of training outcomes, particularly when performance is bimodally distributed across random seeds. In synthetic length generalization tasks, we show that different random seeds can produce either highly linear or emergent scaling trends. We reveal that sharp breakthroughs in metrics are produced by underlying continuous changes in their distribution across seeds. Furthermore, we provide a case study of inverse scaling and show that even as the probability of a successful run declines, the average performance of a successful run continues to increase monotonically. We validate our distributional scaling framework on realistic settings by measuring MMLU performance in LLM populations. These insights emphasize the role of random variation in the effect of scale on LLM capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han-Jia Ye, Si-Yang Liu, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular datasets are inherently heterogeneous, posing significant challenges for developing pre-trained foundation models. The recently introduced transformer-based Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network v2 (TabPFN v2) achieves unprecedented in-context learning accuracy across multiple tabular datasets, marking a pivotal advancement in tabular foundation models. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate TabPFN v2 on over 300 datasets, confirming its exceptional generalization capabilities on small- to medium-scale tasks. Our analysis identifies randomized feature tokens as a key factor behind TabPFN v2's success, as they unify heterogeneous datasets into a fixed-dimensional representation, enabling more effective training and inference. To further understand TabPFN v2's predictions, we propose a leave-one-fold-out approach, transforming TabPFN v2 into a feature extractor and revealing its capability to simplify data distributions and boost accuracy. Lastly, to address TabPFN v2's limitations in high-dimensional, large-scale, and many-category tasks, we introduce a divide-and-conquer mechanism inspired by Chain-of-Thought prompting, enabling scalable inference. By uncovering the mechanisms behind TabPFN v2's success and introducing strategies to expand its applicability, this study provides key insights into the future of tabular foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emiliano Seri, Marcello Petitta, Cristina Cornaro</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into greenhouses not only optimizes land use but also enhances sustainable agricultural practices by enabling dual benefits of food production and renewable energy generation. However, accurate prediction of internal environmental conditions is crucial to ensure optimal crop growth while maximizing energy production. This study introduces a novel application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to greenhouse microclimate modeling, comparing their performance with traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). While RNNs excel at temporal pattern recognition, they cannot explicitly model the directional relationships between environmental variables. Our STGNN approach addresses this limitation by representing these relationships as directed graphs, enabling the model to capture both spatial dependencies and their directionality. Using high-frequency data collected at 15-minute intervals from a greenhouse in Volos, Greece, we demonstrate that RNNs achieve exceptional accuracy in winter conditions (R^2 = 0.985) but show limitations during summer cooling system operation. Though STGNNs currently show lower performance (winter R^2 = 0.947), their architecture offers greater potential for integrating additional variables such as PV generation and crop growth indicators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sasha Voitovych, Mahdi Haghifam, Idan Attias, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite, Roi Livni, Daniel M. Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the necessity of memorization in stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under $\ell_p$ geometries. Informally, we say a learning algorithm memorizes $m$ samples (or is $m$-traceable) if, by analyzing its output, it is possible to identify at least $m$ of its training samples. Our main results uncover a fundamental tradeoff between traceability and excess risk in SCO. For every $p\in [1,\infty)$, we establish the existence of a risk threshold below which any sample-efficient learner must memorize a \em{constant fraction} of its sample. For $p\in [1,2]$, this threshold coincides with best risk of differentially private (DP) algorithms, i.e., above this threshold, there are algorithms that do not memorize even a single sample. This establishes a sharp dichotomy between privacy and traceability for $p \in [1,2]$. For $p \in (2,\infty)$, this threshold instead gives novel lower bounds for DP learning, partially closing an open problem in this setup. En route of proving these results, we introduce a complexity notion we term \em{trace value} of a problem, which unifies privacy lower bounds and traceability results, and prove a sparse variant of the fingerprinting lemma.</p>

<p>Abstract: Increasing interest in reasoning models has led math to become a prominent testing ground for algorithmic and methodological improvements. However, existing open math datasets either contain a small collection of high-quality, human-written problems or a large corpus of machine-generated problems of uncertain quality, forcing researchers to choose between quality and quantity. In this work, we present Big-Math, a dataset of over 250,000 high-quality math questions with verifiable answers, purposefully made for reinforcement learning (RL). To create Big-Math, we rigorously filter, clean, and curate openly available datasets, extracting questions that satisfy our three desiderata: (1) problems with uniquely verifiable solutions, (2) problems that are open-ended, (3) and problems with a closed-form solution. To ensure the quality of Big-Math, we manually verify each step in our filtering process. Based on the findings from our filtering process, we introduce 47,000 new questions with verified answers, Big-Math-Reformulated: closed-ended questions (i.e. multiple choice questions) that have been reformulated as open-ended questions through a systematic reformulation algorithm. Compared to the most commonly used existing open-source datasets for math reasoning, GSM8k and MATH, Big-Math is an order of magnitude larger, while our rigorous filtering ensures that we maintain the questions most suitable for RL. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the dataset, finding that Big-Math contains a high degree of diversity across problem domains, and incorporates a wide range of problem difficulties, enabling a wide range of downstream uses for models of varying capabilities and training requirements. By bridging the gap between data quality and quantity, Big-Math establish a robust foundation for advancing reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that reducing symmetries in neural networks enhances linear mode connectivity between networks without requiring parameter space alignment, leading to improved performance in linearly interpolated neural networks. However, in practical applications, neural network interpolation is rarely used; instead, ensembles of networks are more common. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of reducing symmetries on the performance of deep ensembles and Mixture of Experts (MoE) across five datasets. Additionally, to explore deeper linear mode connectivity, we introduce the Mixture of Interpolated Experts (MoIE). Our results show that deep ensembles built on asymmetric neural networks achieve significantly better performance as ensemble size increases compared to their symmetric counterparts. In contrast, our experiments do not provide conclusive evidence on whether reducing symmetries affects both MoE and MoIE architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer rich potential for clinical prediction, yet their inherent complexity and heterogeneity pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. Domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large collections of unlabeled EHR data have demonstrated promising improvements in predictive accuracy and generalization; however, their training is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets and inconsistencies in coding standards and healthcare practices. In this study, we explore the possibility of using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) based embedding methods as EHR encoders. By serializing patient records into structured Markdown text, transforming codes into human-readable descriptors, we leverage the extensive generalization capabilities of LLMs pretrained on vast public corpora, thereby bypassing the need for proprietary medical datasets. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art LLM-embedding models, GTE-Qwen2-7B-Instruct and LLM2Vec-Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, across 15 diverse clinical prediction tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark, comparing their performance to an EHRspecific foundation model, CLIMBR-T-Base, and traditional machine learning baselines. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based embeddings frequently match or exceed the performance of specialized models, even in few-shot settings, and that their effectiveness scales with the size of the underlying LLM and the available context window. Overall, our findings demonstrate that repurposing LLMs for EHR encoding offers a scalable and effective approach for clinical prediction, capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional EHR modeling and facilitating more interoperable and generalizable healthcare applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liming Liu, Zhenghao Xu, Zixuan Zhang, Hao Kang, Zichong Li, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen, Tuo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, yet their optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complex and high-dimensional loss landscapes they inhabit. While adaptive optimizers such as AdamW are widely used, they suffer from critical limitations, including an inability to capture interdependencies between coordinates and high memory consumption. Subsequent research, exemplified by SOAP, attempts to better capture coordinate interdependence but incurs greater memory overhead, limiting scalability for massive LLMs. An alternative approach aims to reduce memory consumption through low-dimensional projection, but this leads to substantial approximation errors, resulting in less effective optimization (e.g., in terms of per-token efficiency). In this paper, we propose COSMOS, a novel hybrid optimizer that leverages the varying importance of eigensubspaces in the gradient matrix to achieve memory efficiency without compromising optimization performance. The design of COSMOS is motivated by our empirical insights and practical considerations. Specifically, COSMOS applies SOAP to the leading eigensubspace, which captures the primary optimization dynamics, and MUON to the remaining eigensubspace, which is less critical but computationally expensive to handle with SOAP. This hybrid strategy significantly reduces memory consumption while maintaining robust optimization performance, making it particularly suitable for massive LLMs. Numerical experiments on various datasets and transformer architectures are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of COSMOS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Wollschl\"ager, Jannes Elstner, Simon Geisler, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Stephan G\"unnemann, Johannes Gasteiger</p>
<p>Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) can be circumvented through adversarially crafted inputs, yet the mechanisms by which these attacks bypass safety barriers remain poorly understood. Prior work suggests that a single refusal direction in the model's activation space determines whether an LLM refuses a request. In this study, we propose a novel gradient-based approach to representation engineering and use it to identify refusal directions. Contrary to prior work, we uncover multiple independent directions and even multi-dimensional concept cones that mediate refusal. Moreover, we show that orthogonality alone does not imply independence under intervention, motivating the notion of representational independence that accounts for both linear and non-linear effects. Using this framework, we identify mechanistically independent refusal directions. We show that refusal mechanisms in LLMs are governed by complex spatial structures and identify functionally independent directions, confirming that multiple distinct mechanisms drive refusal behavior. Our gradient-based approach uncovers these mechanisms and can further serve as a foundation for future work on understanding LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Frankel, Sitan Chen, Jerry Li, Pang Wei Koh, Lillian J. Ratliff, Sewoong Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) create samples from a data distribution by starting from random noise and iteratively solving a reverse-time ordinary differential equation (ODE). Because each step in the iterative solution requires an expensive neural function evaluation (NFE), there has been significant interest in approximately solving these diffusion ODEs with only a few NFEs without modifying the underlying model. However, in the few NFE regime, we observe that tracking the true ODE evolution is fundamentally impossible using traditional ODE solvers. In this work, we propose a new method that learns a good solver for the DM, which we call Solving for the Solver (S4S). S4S directly optimizes a solver to obtain good generation quality by learning to match the output of a strong teacher solver. We evaluate S4S on six different pre-trained DMs, including pixel-space and latent-space DMs for both conditional and unconditional sampling. In all settings, S4S uniformly improves the sample quality relative to traditional ODE solvers. Moreover, our method is lightweight, data-free, and can be plugged in black-box on top of any discretization schedule or architecture to improve performance. Building on top of this, we also propose S4S-Alt, which optimizes both the solver and the discretization schedule. By exploiting the full design space of DM solvers, with 5 NFEs, we achieve an FID of 3.73 on CIFAR10 and 13.26 on MS-COCO, representing a $1.5\times$ improvement over previous training-free ODE methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichi Zhang, Yici Yan, Alex Schwing, Zhizhen Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: We formulate a hierarchical rectified flow to model data distributions. It hierarchically couples multiple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and defines a time-differentiable stochastic process that generates a data distribution from a known source distribution. Each ODE resembles the ODE that is solved in a classic rectified flow, but differs in its domain, i.e., location, velocity, acceleration, etc. Unlike the classic rectified flow formulation, which formulates a single ODE in the location domain and only captures the expected velocity field (sufficient to capture a multi-modal data distribution), the hierarchical rectified flow formulation models the multi-modal random velocity field, acceleration field, etc., in their entirety. This more faithful modeling of the random velocity field enables integration paths to intersect when the underlying ODE is solved during data generation. Intersecting paths in turn lead to integration trajectories that are more straight than those obtained in the classic rectified flow formulation, where integration paths cannot intersect. This leads to modeling of data distributions with fewer neural function evaluations. We empirically verify this on synthetic 1D and 2D data as well as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-32 data.

In this paper, we introduce a new level of modularization by abstracting generative models into atomic generative modules. Analogous to fractals in mathematics, our method constructs a new type of generative model by recursively invoking atomic generative modules, resulting in self-similar fractal architectures that we call fractal generative models. As a running example, we instantiate our fractal framework using autoregressive models as the atomic generative modules and examine it on the challenging task of pixel-by-pixel image generation, demonstrating strong performance in both likelihood estimation and generation quality.

<p>Abstract: The development of electronic stethoscopes and wearable recording sensors opened the door to the automated analysis of bowel sound (BS) signals.

This work leverages a BS dataset collected from 16 healthy subjects that was annotated according to four established BS patterns. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models to detect and/or classify BS patterns. The selection of considered models covers models using tabular features, convolutional neural networks based on spectrograms and models pre-trained on large audio datasets. The results highlight the clear superiority of pre-trained models, particularly in detecting classes with few samples, achieving an AUC of 0.89 in distinguishing BS from non-BS using a HuBERT model and an AUC of 0.89 in differentiating bowel sound patterns using a Wav2Vec 2.0 model. These results pave the way for an improved understanding of bowel sounds in general and future machine-learning-driven diagnostic applications for gastrointestinal examinations</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingpeng Du, Zhu Sun, Ziyan Wang, Haoyan Chua, Jie Zhang, Yew-Soon Ong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way for accurate session-based recommendation (SBR), but they demand substantial computational time and memory. Knowledge distillation (KD)-based methods can alleviate these issues by transferring the knowledge to a small student, which trains a student based on the predictions of a cumbersome teacher. However, these methods encounter difficulties for \textit{LLM-based KD in SBR}. 1) It is expensive to make LLMs predict for all instances in KD. 2) LLMs may make ineffective predictions for some instances in KD, e.g., incorrect predictions for hard instances or similar predictions as existing recommenders for easy instances. In this paper, we propose an active LLM-based KD method in SBR, contributing to sustainable AI. To efficiently distill knowledge from LLMs with limited cost, we propose to extract a small proportion of instances predicted by LLMs. Meanwhile, for a more effective distillation, we propose an active learning strategy to extract instances that are as effective as possible for KD from a theoretical view. Specifically, we first formulate gains based on potential effects (e.g., effective, similar, and incorrect predictions by LLMs) and difficulties (e.g., easy or hard to fit) of instances for KD. Then, we propose to maximize the minimal gains of distillation to find the optimal selection policy for active learning, which can largely avoid extracting ineffective instances in KD. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for SBR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Fei, Xinyue Zhang, Jingjing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In recommender systems, post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimation is an essential task to model user preferences for items and estimate the value of recommendations. Sample selection bias (SSB) and data sparsity (DS) are two persistent challenges for post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimation. Currently, entire-space approaches that exploit unclicked samples through knowledge distillation are promising to mitigate SSB and DS simultaneously. Existing methods use non-conversion, conversion, or adaptive conversion predictors to generate pseudo labels for unclicked samples. However, they fail to consider the unbiasedness and information limitations of these pseudo labels. Motivated by such analysis, we propose an entire-space variational information exploitation framework (EVI) for CVR prediction. First, EVI uses a conditional entire-space CVR teacher to generate unbiased pseudo labels. Then, it applies variational information exploitation and logit distillation to transfer non-click space information to the target CVR estimator. We conduct extensive offline experiments on six large-scale datasets. EVI demonstrated a 2.25\% average improvement compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs are an efficient method for representing and connecting information across various concepts, useful in reasoning, question answering, and knowledge base completion tasks. They organize data by linking points, enabling researchers to combine diverse information sources into a single database. This interdisciplinary approach helps uncover new research questions and ideas. Knowledge graphs create a web of data points (nodes) and their connections (edges), which enhances navigation, comprehension, and utilization of data for multiple purposes. They capture complex relationships inherent in unstructured data sources, offering a semantic framework for diverse entities and their attributes. Strategies for developing knowledge graphs include using seed data, named entity recognition, and relationship extraction. These graphs enhance chatbot accuracy and include multimedia data for richer information. Creating high-quality knowledge graphs involves both automated methods and human oversight, essential for accurate and comprehensive data representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The cold start problem is a challenging problem faced by most modern recommender systems. By leveraging knowledge from other domains, cross-domain recommendation can be an effective method to alleviate the cold start problem. However, the modelling distortion for long-tail data, which is widely present in recommender systems, is often overlooked in cross-domain recommendation. In this research, we propose a hyperbolic manifold based cross-domain collaborative filtering model using BiTGCF as the base model. We introduce the hyperbolic manifold and construct new propagation layer and transfer layer to address these challenges. The significant performance improvements across various datasets compared to the baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangyu Wu, Siqi Song, Xianglin Qiu, Xiaowei Huang, Fei Ma, Jimin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to predict future user interactions based on historical interactions across multiple domains. The key challenge in CDSR is effectively capturing cross-domain user preferences by fully leveraging both intra-sequence and inter-sequence item interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Image Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (IFCDSR), which incorporates item image information to better capture visual preferences. Our approach integrates a frozen CLIP model to generate image embeddings, enriching original item embeddings with visual data from both intra-sequence and inter-sequence interactions. Additionally, we employ a multiple attention layer to capture cross-domain interests, enabling joint learning of single-domain and cross-domain user preferences. To validate the effectiveness of IFCDSR, we re-partitioned four e-commerce datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that IFCDSR significantly outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Shi, Shanglin Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fashion, deeply rooted in sociocultural dynamics, evolves as individuals emulate styles popularized by influencers and iconic figures. In the quest to replicate such refined tastes using artificial intelligence, traditional fashion ensemble methods have primarily used supervised learning to imitate the decisions of style icons, which falter when faced with distribution shifts, leading to style replication discrepancies triggered by slight variations in input. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have become prominent across various sectors, recognized for their user-friendly interfaces, strong conversational skills, and advanced reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Fashion Large Language Model (FLLM), which employs auto-prompt generation training strategies to enhance its capacity for delivering personalized fashion advice while retaining essential domain knowledge. Additionally, by integrating a retrieval augmentation technique during inference, the model can better adjust to individual preferences. Our results show that this approach surpasses existing models in accuracy, interpretability, and few-shot learning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexu Sun, Qiyu Han, Minqin Zhu, Hao Gong, Dugang Liu, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving user engagement and platform revenue is crucial for online marketing platforms. Uplift modeling is proposed to solve this problem, which applies different treatments (e.g., discounts, bonus) to satisfy corresponding users. Despite progress in this field, limitations persist. Firstly, most of them focus on scenarios where only user features exist. However, in real-world scenarios, there are rich contexts available in the online platform (e.g., short videos, news), and the uplift model needs to infer an incentive for each user on the specific item, which is called real-time marketing. Thus, only considering the user features will lead to biased prediction of the responses, which may cause the cumulative error for uplift prediction. Moreover, due to the large-scale contexts, directly concatenating the context features with the user features will cause a severe distribution shift in the treatment and control groups. Secondly, capturing the interaction relationship between the user features and context features can better predict the user response. To solve the above limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic Robust Uplift Modeling with Large-Scale Contexts (UMLC) framework for Real-time Marketing. Our UMLC includes two customized modules. 1) A response-guided context grouping module for extracting context features information and condensing value space through clusters. 2) A feature interaction module for obtaining better uplift prediction. Specifically, this module contains two parts: a user-context interaction component for better modeling the response; a treatment-feature interaction component for discovering the treatment assignment sensitive feature of each instance to better predict the uplift. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and a real-world product dataset to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our UMLC.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of AI in education offers significant potential to enhance learning efficiency. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, allow students to query a wide range of topics, providing unprecedented flexibility. However, LLMs face challenges, such as handling varying content relevance and lack of personalization. To address these challenges, we propose TutorLLM, a personalized learning recommender LLM system based on Knowledge Tracing (KT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The novelty of TutorLLM lies in its unique combination of KT and RAG techniques with LLMs, which enables dynamic retrieval of context-specific knowledge and provides personalized learning recommendations based on the student's personal learning state. Specifically, this integration allows TutorLLM to tailor responses based on individual learning states predicted by the Multi-Features with Latent Relations BERT-based KT (MLFBK) model and to enhance response accuracy with a Scraper model. The evaluation includes user assessment questionnaires and performance metrics, demonstrating a 10\% improvement in user satisfaction and a 5\% increase in quiz scores compared to using general LLMs alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimizing task-to-core allocation can substantially reduce power consumption in multi-core platforms without degrading user experience. However, many existing approaches overlook critical factors such as parallelism, compute intensity, and heterogeneous core types. In this paper, we introduce a statistical learning approach for feature selection that identifies the most influential features - such as core type, speed, temperature, and application-level parallelism or memory intensity - for accurate environment modeling and efficient energy optimization. Our experiments, conducted with state-of-the-art Linux governors and thermal modeling techniques, show that correlation-aware task-to-core allocation lowers energy consumption by up to 10% and reduces core temperature by up to 5 degrees Celsius compared to random core selection. Furthermore, our compressed, bootstrapped regression model improves thermal prediction accuracy by 6% while cutting model parameters by 16%, yielding an overall mean square error reduction of 61.6% relative to existing approaches. We provided results based on superscalar Intel Core i7 12th Gen processors with 14 cores, but validated our method across a diverse set of hardware platforms and effectively balanced performance, power, and thermal demands through statistical feature evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mara Graziani, Malina Molnar, Irina Espejo Morales, Joris Cadow-Gossweiler, Teodoro Laino</p>
<p>Abstract: As the volume of publicly available data continues to grow, researchers face the challenge of limited diversity in benchmarking machine learning tasks. Although thousands of datasets are available in public repositories, the sheer abundance often complicates the search for suitable data, leaving many valuable datasets underexplored. This situation is further amplified by the fact that, despite longstanding advocacy for improving data curation quality, current solutions remain prohibitively time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines intelligent agents with retrieval augmented generation to automate data analysis, dataset curation and indexing at scale. Our system leverages multiple agents to analyze raw, unstructured data across public repositories, generating dataset reports and interactive visual indexes that can be easily explored. We demonstrate that our approach results in more detailed dataset descriptions, higher hit rates and greater diversity in dataset retrieval tasks. Additionally, we show that the dataset reports generated by our method can be leveraged by other machine learning models to improve the performance on specific tasks, such as improving the accuracy and realism of synthetic data generation. By streamlining the process of transforming raw data into machine-learning-ready datasets, our approach enables researchers to better utilize existing data resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: Loyal AI is loyal to the community that builds it. An AI is loyal to a community if the community has ownership, alignment, and control. Community owned models can only be used with the approval of the community and share the economic rewards communally. Community aligned models have values that are aligned with the consensus of the community. Community controlled models perform functions designed by the community. Since we would like permissionless access to the loyal AI's community, we need the AI to be open source. The key scientific question then is: how can we build models that are openly accessible (open source) and yet are owned and governed by the community. This seeming impossibility is the focus of this paper where we outline a concrete pathway to Open, Monetizable and Loyal models (OML), building on our earlier work on OML, arXiv:2411.03887(1) , and a representation via a cryptographic-ML library http://github.com/sentient-agi/oml-1.0-fingerprinting .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luiz Tavares, Jose Mazzon, Francisco Paletta, Fabio Barros</p>
<p>Abstract: The marketing departments of financial institutions strive to craft products and services that cater to the diverse needs of businesses of all sizes. However, it is evident upon analysis that larger corporations often receive a more substantial portion of available funds. This disparity arises from the relative ease of assessing the risk of default and bankruptcy in these more prominent companies. Historically, risk analysis studies have focused on data from publicly traded or stock exchange-listed companies, leaving a gap in knowledge about small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Addressing this gap, this study introduces a method for evaluating SMEs by generating images for processing via a convolutional neural network (CNN). To this end, more than 10,000 images, one for each company in the sample, were created to identify scenarios in which the CNN can operate with higher assertiveness and reduced training error probability. The findings demonstrate a significant predictive capacity, achieving 97.8% accuracy, when a substantial number of images are utilized. Moreover, the image creation method paves the way for potential applications of this technique in various sectors and for different analytical purposes.</p>

<p>Abstract: The construction of channel gain map (CGM) is essential for realizing environment-aware wireless communications expected in 6G, for which a fundamental problem is how to predict the channel gains at unknown locations effectively by a finite number of measurements. As using a single prediction model is not effective in complex propagation environments, we propose a subregional learning-based CGM construction scheme, with which the entire map is divided into subregions via data-driven clustering, then individual models are constructed and trained for every subregion. In this way, specific propagation feature in each subregion can be better extracted with finite training data. Moreover, we propose to further improve prediction accuracy by uneven subregion sampling, as well as training data reuse around the subregion boundaries. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in CGM construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Agarwal, Sai Sundaresan, Subrata Mitra, Debabrata Mahapatra, Archit Gupta, Rounak Sharma, Nirmal Joshua Kapu, Tong Yu, Shiv Saini</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is often used with Large Language Models (LLMs) to infuse domain knowledge or user-specific information. In RAG, given a user query, a retriever extracts chunks of relevant text from a knowledge base. These chunks are sent to an LLM as part of the input prompt. Typically, any given chunk is repeatedly retrieved across user questions. However, currently, for every question, attention-layers in LLMs fully compute the key values (KVs) repeatedly for the input chunks, as state-of-the-art methods cannot reuse KV-caches when chunks appear at arbitrary locations with arbitrary contexts. Naive reuse leads to output quality degradation. This leads to potentially redundant computations on expensive GPUs and increases latency. In this work, we propose Cache-Craft, a system for managing and reusing precomputed KVs corresponding to the text chunks (we call chunk-caches) in RAG-based systems. We present how to identify chunk-caches that are reusable, how to efficiently perform a small fraction of recomputation to fix the cache to maintain output quality, and how to efficiently store and evict chunk-caches in the hardware for maximizing reuse while masking any overheads. With real production workloads as well as synthetic datasets, we show that Cache-Craft reduces redundant computation by 51% over SOTA prefix-caching and 75% over full recomputation. Additionally, with continuous batching on a real production workload, we get a 1.6X speed up in throughput and a 2X reduction in end-to-end response latency over prefix-caching while maintaining quality, for both the LLaMA-3-8B and LLaMA-3-70B models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distributed DNN inference is becoming increasingly important as the demand for intelligent services at the network edge grows. By leveraging the power of distributed computing, edge devices can perform complicated and resource-hungry inference tasks previously only possible on powerful servers, enabling new applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and smart homes. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate and efficient distributed edge inference due to the fluctuating nature of the actual resources of the devices and the processing difficulty of the input data. In this work, we propose DistrEE, a distributed DNN inference framework that can exit model inference early to meet specific quality of service requirements. In particular, the framework firstly integrates model early exit and distributed inference for multi-node collaborative inferencing scenarios. Furthermore, it designs an early exit policy to control when the model inference terminates. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that DistrEE can efficiently realize efficient collaborative inference, achieving an effective trade-off between inference latency and accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a multitude of application opportunities. One traditional task for Information Retrieval systems is the summarization and classification of texts, both of which are important for supporting humans in navigating large literature bodies as they e.g. exist with scientific publications. Due to this rapidly growing body of scientific knowledge, recent research has been aiming at building research information systems that not only offer traditional keyword search capabilities, but also novel features such as the automatic detection of research areas that are present at knowledge intensive organizations in academia and industry. To facilitate this idea, we present the results obtained from evaluating a variety of LLMs in their ability to sort scientific publications into hierarchical classifications systems. Using the FORC dataset as ground truth data, we have found that recent LLMs (such as Meta Llama 3.1) are able to reach an accuracy of up to 0.82, which is up to 0.08 better than traditional BERT models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mobile Edge Caching (MEC) plays a pivotal role in mitigating latency in data-intensive services by dynamically caching frequently requested content on edge servers. This capability is critical for applications such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Autonomous Vehicles (AV), where efficient content caching and accurate popularity prediction are essential for optimizing performance. In this paper, we explore the problem of popularity prediction in MEC by utilizing historical time-series request data of intended files, formulating this problem as a ranking task. To this aim, we propose CacheMamba model by employing Mamba, a state-space model (SSM)-based architecture, to identify the top-K files with the highest likelihood of being requested. We then benchmark the proposed model against a Transformer-based approach, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of cache-hit rate, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Floating-Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS), particularly when dealing with longer sequences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stock Price Trend Prediction (SPTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and struggle to reliably predict short-term trends. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias. To assess TLOB's effectiveness, we evaluate it on the well-known FI-2010 benchmark (F1 of 92.8\%) and on Tesla (+2.67\% on F1) and Intel (+14.16\% on F1). Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time (-6.68 absolute points in F1), highlighting the growing market efficiencies. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alain Hennebelle, Qifan Dieng, Leila Ismail, Rajkumar Buyya</p>
<p>Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes smart city domains such as healthcare, transportation, industry, and education. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining prominence, particularly in smart hospitals and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). The vast volume of data generated by IoMT devices should be analyzed in real-time for health surveillance, prognosis, and prediction of diseases. Current approaches relying on Cloud computing to provide the necessary computing and storage capabilities do not scale for these latency-sensitive applications. Edge computing emerges as a solution by bringing cloud services closer to IoMT devices. This paper introduces SmartEdge, an AI-powered smart healthcare end-to-end integrated edge and cloud computing system for diabetes prediction. This work addresses latency concerns and demonstrates the efficacy of edge resources in healthcare applications within an end-to-end system. The system leverages various risk factors for diabetes prediction. We propose an Edge and Cloud-enabled framework to deploy the proposed diabetes prediction models on various configurations using edge nodes and main cloud servers. Performance metrics are evaluated using, latency, accuracy, and response time. By using ensemble machine learning voting algorithms we can improve the prediction accuracy by 5% versus a single model prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Pang, Kai Li, Ruifeng She, Feifan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), it has become increasingly important to optimize hardware usage and improve throughput. In this paper, we study the inference optimization of the serving system that deploys LLMs. To optimize system throughput and maximize hardware utilization, we formulate the inference optimization problem as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and propose a hybrid offline-online method as solution. The offline method improves large-scale inference systems by introducing a Minimizing Makespan Bin Packing Problem. We further provide a theoretical lower bound computation method. Then, we propose an online sorting and preemptive scheduling method to better utilize hardware. In the online iteration scheduling process, a Lagrangian method is applied to evaluate the cost efficiency of inserting prefill stages versus decode stages at each iteration and dynamically determine when to preempt decoding tasks and insert prefill tasks. Experiments using real-world data from the LLaMA-65B model and the GSM8K dataset demonstrate that system utilization improves from 80.2% to 89.1%, and the total inference time decreases from 201.00 to 190.58 seconds. A 100-cases study shows that our method consistently outperforms the baseline method and improves the utilization rate by 8.0% on average. Finally, we discuss potential future extensions, including stochastic modeling, reinforcement learning-based schedulers, and dynamic decision-making strategies for system throughput and hardware utilization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yigitcan Yardimci, Mustafa Cavus</p>
<p>Abstract: The prediction of the Remaining Useful Life of aircraft engines is a critical area in high-reliability sectors such as aerospace and defense. Early failure predictions help ensure operational continuity, reduce maintenance costs, and prevent unexpected failures. Traditional regression models struggle with censored data, which can lead to biased predictions. Survival models, on the other hand, effectively handle censored data, improving predictive accuracy in maintenance processes. This paper introduces a novel approach based on the Rashomon perspective, which considers multiple models that achieve similar performance rather than relying on a single best model. This enables uncertainty quantification in survival probability predictions and enhances decision-making in predictive maintenance. The Rashomon survival curve was introduced to represent the range of survival probability estimates, providing insights into model agreement and uncertainty over time. The results on the CMAPSS dataset demonstrate that relying solely on a single model for RUL estimation may increase risk in some scenarios. The censoring levels significantly impact prediction uncertainty, with longer censoring times leading to greater variability in survival probabilities. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating model multiplicity in predictive maintenance frameworks to achieve more reliable and robust failure predictions. This paper contributes to uncertainty quantification in RUL prediction and highlights the Rashomon perspective as a powerful tool for predictive modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nvidia Jetson boards are powerful systems for executing artificial intelligence workloads in edge and mobile environments due to their effective GPU hardware and widely supported software stack. In addition to these benefits, Nvidia Jetson boards provide large configurability by giving the user the choice to modify many hardware parameters. This large space of configurability creates the need of searching the optimal configurations based on the user's requirements. In this work, we propose JExplore, a multi-board software and hardware design space exploration tool. JExplore can be integrated with any search tool, hence creating a common benchmarking ground for the search algorithms. Moreover, it accelerates the exploration of user application and Nvidia Jetson configurations for researchers and engineers by encapsulating host-client communication, configuration management, and metric measurement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Jiang, Yuanliang Li, Luyang Hou, Mohsen Ghafouri, Peng Zhang, Jun Yan, Yuhong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the large number of prosumers deploying distributed energy resources (DERs), integrating these prosumers into a transactive energy market (TEM) is a trend for the future smart grid. A community-based double auction market is considered a promising TEM that can encourage prosumers to participate and maximize social welfare. However, the traditional TEM is challenging to model explicitly due to the random bidding behavior of prosumers and uncertainties caused by the energy operation of DERs. Furthermore, although reinforcement learning algorithms provide a model-free solution to optimize prosumers' bidding strategies, their use in TEM is still challenging due to their scalability, stability, and privacy protection limitations. To address the above challenges, in this study, we design a double auction-based TEM with multiple DERs-equipped prosumers to transparently and efficiently manage energy transactions. We also propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model with distributed learning and execution to ensure the scalability and privacy of the market environment. Additionally, the design of two bidding actions (i.e., bidding price and quantity) optimizes the bidding strategies for prosumers. Simulation results show that (1) the designed TEM and DRL model are robust; (2) the proposed DRL model effectively balances the energy payment and comfort satisfaction for prosumers and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in optimizing the bidding strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Wang, Chen Weidong, Huang Zhifeng, Md Raisul Islam, Chua Kian Jon</p>
<p>Abstract: In tropical countries with high humidity, air conditioning can account for up to 60% of a building's energy use. For commercial buildings with centralized systems, the efficiency of the chiller plant is vital, and model predictive control provides an effective strategy for optimizing operations through dynamic adjustments based on accurate load predictions. Artificial neural networks are effective for modelling nonlinear systems but are prone to overfitting due to their complexity. Effective feature engineering can mitigate this issue. While weather data are crucial for load prediction, they are often used as raw numerical inputs without advanced processing. Clustering features is a technique that can reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Although previous studies have explored clustering algorithms for load prediction, none have applied them to multidimensional weather data, revealing a research gap. This study presents a cooling load prediction model that combines a neural network with Kalman filtering and K-means clustering. Applied to real world data from a commercial skyscraper in Singapore's central business district, the model achieved a 46.5% improvement in prediction accuracy. An optimal chiller sequencing strategy was also developed through genetic algorithm optimization of the predictive load, potentially saving 13.8% in energy. Finally, the study evaluated the integration of thermal energy storage into the chiller plant design, demonstrating potential reductions in capital and operational costs of 26% and 13%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giorgio Palma, Andrea Serani, Shawn Aram, David W. Wundrow, David Drazen, Matteo Diez</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces and compares the Hankel dynamic mode decomposition with control (Hankel-DMDc) and a novel Bayesian extension of Hankel-DMDc as model-free (i.e., data-driven and equation-free) approaches for system identification and prediction of free-running ship motions in irregular waves. The proposed DMDc methods create a reduced-order model using limited data from the system state and incoming wave elevation histories, with the latter and rudder angle serving as forcing inputs. The inclusion of delayed states of the system as additional dimensions per the Hankel-DMDc improves the representation of the underlying non-linear dynamics of the system by DMD. The approaches are statistically assessed using data from free-running simulations of a 5415M hull's course-keeping in irregular beam-quartering waves at sea state 7, a highly severe condition characterized by nonlinear responses near roll-resonance. The results demonstrate robust performance and remarkable computational efficiency. The results indicate that the proposed methods effectively identify the dynamic system in analysis. Furthermore, the Bayesian formulation incorporates uncertainty quantification and enhances prediction accuracy. Ship motions are predicted with good agreement with test data over a 15 encounter waves observation window. No significant accuracy degradation is noted along the test sequences, suggesting the method can support accurate and efficient maritime design and operational planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Qiu, Zheng Huang, Haoyu Hu, Aosong Feng, Yujun Yan, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals into text has been a key challenge in the neuroscience community, with the potential to advance brain-computer interfaces and uncover deeper insights into brain mechanisms. However, existing approaches often struggle with suboptimal predictive performance, limited task variety, and poor generalization across subjects. In response to this, we propose MindLLM, a model designed for subject-agnostic and versatile fMRI-to-text decoding. MindLLM consists of an fMRI encoder and an off-the-shelf LLM. The fMRI encoder employs a neuroscience-informed attention mechanism, which is capable of accommodating subjects with varying input shapes and thus achieves high-performance subject-agnostic decoding. Moreover, we introduce Brain Instruction Tuning (BIT), a novel approach that enhances the model's ability to capture diverse semantic representations from fMRI signals, facilitating more versatile decoding. We evaluate MindLLM on comprehensive fMRI-to-text benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines, improving downstream tasks by 12.0%, unseen subject generalization by 16.4%, and novel task adaptation by 25.0%. Furthermore, the attention patterns in MindLLM provide interpretable insights into its decision-making process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sirui Li, Wenbin Ouyang, Yining Ma, Cathy Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-horizon combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), such as the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), often involve complex, interdependent decisions over extended time frames, posing significant challenges for existing solvers. While Rolling Horizon Optimization (RHO) addresses this by decomposing problems into overlapping shorter-horizon subproblems, such overlap often involves redundant computations. In this paper, we present L-RHO, the first learning-guided RHO framework for COPs. L-RHO employs a neural network to intelligently fix variables that in hindsight did not need to be re-optimized, resulting in smaller and thus easier-to-solve subproblems. For FJSP, this means identifying operations with unchanged machine assignments between consecutive subproblems. Applied to FJSP, L-RHO accelerates RHO by up to 54% while significantly improving solution quality, outperforming other heuristic and learning-based baselines. We also provide in-depth discussions and verify the desirable adaptability and generalization of L-RHO across numerous FJSP variates, distributions, online scenarios and benchmark instances. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis to elucidate the conditions under which learning is beneficial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Wu, Chengjie Lu, Aitor Arrieta, Shaukat Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) make driving decisions without human intervention. Therefore, ensuring AVs' dependability is critical. Despite significant research and development in AV development, their dependability assurance remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and unpredictability of their operating environments. Scenario-based testing evaluates AVs under various driving scenarios, but the unlimited number of potential scenarios highlights the importance of identifying critical scenarios that can violate safety or functional requirements. Such requirements are inherently interdependent and need to be tested simultaneously. To this end, we propose MOEQT, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)-based approach to generate critical scenarios that simultaneously test interdependent safety and functional requirements. MOEQT adapts Envelope Q-learning as the MORL algorithm, which dynamically adapts multi-objective weights to balance the relative importance between multiple objectives. MOEQT generates critical scenarios to violate multiple requirements through dynamically interacting with the AV environment, ensuring comprehensive AV testing. We evaluate MOEQT using an advanced end-to-end AV controller and a high-fidelity simulator and compare MOEQT with two baselines: a random strategy and a single-objective RL with a weighted reward function. Our evaluation results show that MOEQT achieved an overall better performance in identifying critical scenarios for violating multiple requirements than the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Willy Chan, Michael Souliman, Jakob Nordhagen, Brando Miranda, Elyas Obbad, Kai Fronsdal Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical language into formal specifications and proofs remains a difficult task for state-of-the-art (large) language models. Existing works point to competing explanations for the performance gap. To this end, we introduce a novel methodology that leverages back-translation with hand-curated prompts to enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models, particularly addressing the challenge posed by the scarcity of labeled data. Specifically, we evaluate three primary variations of this strategy: (1) on-the-fly (online) backtranslation, (2) distilled (offline) backtranslation with few-shot amplification, and (3) line-by-line proof analysis integrated with proof state information. Each variant is designed to optimize data quality over quantity, focusing on the high fidelity of generated proofs rather than sheer data scale. Our findings provide evidence that employing our proposed approaches to generate synthetic data, which prioritizes quality over volume, improves the Autoformalization performance of LLMs as measured by standard benchmarks such as ProofNet. Crucially, our approach outperforms pretrained models using a minimal number of tokens. We also show, through strategic prompting and backtranslation, that our approaches surpass the performance of fine-tuning with extensive multilingual datasets such as MMA on ProofNet with only 1/150th of the tokens. Taken together, our methods show a promising new approach to significantly reduce the resources required to formalize proofs, thereby accelerating AI for math.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yao, Xuan Tong, Ruofan Wang, Yixu Wang, Lujundong Li, Liang Liu, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, claude-sonnet and gemini-thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking claude-sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid model that integrates long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to significantly enhance the accuracy of stock market predictions. The LSTM component adeptly captures temporal patterns in stock price data, effectively modeling the time series dynamics of financial markets. Concurrently, the GNN component leverages Pearson correlation and association analysis to model inter-stock relational data, capturing complex nonlinear polyadic dependencies influencing stock prices. The model is trained and evaluated using an expanding window validation approach, enabling continuous learning from increasing amounts of data and adaptation to evolving market conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on historical stock data demonstrate that our hybrid LSTM-GNN model achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.00144, representing a substantial reduction of 10.6% compared to the MSE of the standalone LSTM model of 0.00161. Furthermore, the hybrid model outperforms traditional and advanced benchmarks, including linear regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and dense networks. These compelling results underscore the significant potential of combining temporal and relational data through a hybrid approach, offering a powerful tool for real-time trading and financial analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuke Hayashi, Koichi Takahashi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework unifying AIXI -- a model of universal AI -- with variational empowerment as an intrinsic drive for exploration. We build on the existing framework of Self-AIXI -- a universal learning agent that predicts its own actions -- by showing how one of its established terms can be interpreted as a variational empowerment objective. We further demonstrate that universal AI's planning process can be cast as minimizing expected variational free energy (the core principle of active Inference), thereby revealing how universal AI agents inherently balance goal-directed behavior with uncertainty reduction curiosity). Moreover, we argue that power-seeking tendencies of universal AI agents can be explained not only as an instrumental strategy to secure future reward, but also as a direct consequence of empowerment maximization -- i.e.\ the agent's intrinsic drive to maintain or expand its own controllability in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to show how these intrinsic motivations (empowerment, curiosity) systematically lead universal AI agents to seek and sustain high-optionality states. We prove that Self-AIXI asymptotically converges to the same performance as AIXI under suitable conditions, and highlight that its power-seeking behavior emerges naturally from both reward maximization and curiosity-driven exploration. Since AIXI can be view as a Bayes-optimal mathematical formulation for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianzuo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a financial fraud detection system based on improved Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Specifically, the system introduces a novel model architecture called GBM-SSRF (Gradient Boosting Machine with Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest), which cleverly combines the powerful optimization capabilities of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) with improved randomization. The computational efficiency and feature extraction capabilities of the Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest (SSRF) forest significantly improve the performance of financial fraud detection. Although the traditional random forest model has good classification capabilities, it has high computational complexity when faced with large-scale data and has certain limitations in feature selection. As a commonly used ensemble learning method, the GBM model has significant advantages in optimizing performance and handling nonlinear problems. However, GBM takes a long time to train and is prone to overfitting problems when data samples are unbalanced. In response to these limitations, this paper optimizes the random forest based on the structure, reducing the computational complexity and improving the feature selection ability through the structural simplification and enhancement of the random forest. In addition, the optimized random forest is embedded into the GBM framework, and the model can maintain efficiency and stability with the help of GBM's gradient optimization capability. Experiments show that the GBM-SSRF model not only has good performance, but also has good robustness and generalization capabilities, providing an efficient and reliable solution for financial fraud detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JaeHong Kim (Legal Research Institute of Korea University, Seoul, Korea)</p>
<p>Abstract: The expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns about transparency, accountability, and interpretability, with counterfactual reasoning emerging as a key approach to addressing these issues. However, current mathematical, technological, and causal methodologies rely on externalization techniques that normalize feature relationships within a single coordinate space, often distorting intrinsic interactions. This study proposes the Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory, a framework integrating mathematical, technological, and causal perspectives to provide a more precise and comprehensive analysis of feature relationships. CFP theory introduces Hilbert space and backward causation to reinterpret the feature relationships as emergent structures, offering a potential solution to the common cause problem -- a fundamental challenge in causal modeling. From a mathematical -- technical perspective, it utilizes a Riemannian manifold-based framework, thereby improving the structural representation of high- and low-dimensional data interactions. From a causal inference perspective, CFP theory adopts abduction as a methodological foundation, employing Hilbert space for a dynamic causal reasoning approach, where causal relationships are inferred abductively, and feature relationships evolve as emergent properties. Ultimately, CFP theory introduces a novel AI modeling methodology that integrates Hilbert space, backward causation, and Riemannian geometry, strengthening AI governance and transparency in counterfactual reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiancheng Li, Yan Song, Hongqi Fan, Jingdong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Borui Yang, Md Afif Al Mamun, Jie M. Zhang, Gias Uddin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, e.g., factually incorrect information, in their responses. These hallucinations present challenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external resources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete coverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor scalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which are often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper presents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that leverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods, MetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if an LLM's response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will be violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource hallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on two open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the four LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin ranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and 0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score). For instance, with Mistral-7B, MetaQA achieves an average F1-score of 0.435, compared to SelfCheckGPT's F1-score of 0.205, representing an improvement rate of 112.2%. MetaQA also demonstrates superiority across all different categories of questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Hovd, Alona Kryshchenko, Michael N. Neely, Julian Otalvaro, Alan Schumitzky, Walter M. Yamada</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a non-parametric estimation algorithm designed to effectively estimate the joint distribution of model parameters with application to population pharmacokinetics. Our research group has previously developed the non-parametric adaptive grid (NPAG) algorithm, which while accurate, explores parameter space using an ad-hoc method to suggest new support points. In contrast, the non-parametric optimal design (NPOD) algorithm uses a gradient approach to suggest new support points, which reduces the amount of time spent evaluating non-relevant points and by this the overall number of cycles required to reach convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate that the NPOD algorithm achieves similar solutions to NPAG across two datasets, while being significantly more efficient in both the number of cycles required and overall runtime. Given the importance of developing robust and efficient algorithms for determining drug doses quickly in pharmacokinetics, the NPOD algorithm represents a valuable advancement in non-parametric modeling. Further analysis is needed to determine which algorithm performs better under specific conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Fan, Guoqiang Ma, Yuanfeng Song, Lixin Fan, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into task-specific Small Language Models (SLMs) encounters two significant challenges: safeguarding domain-specific knowledge privacy and managing limited resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose PPC-GPT, a innovative privacy-preserving federated framework specifically designed for compressing LLMs into task-specific SLMs via pruning and Chain-of-Thought (COT) distillation. PPC-GPT works on a server-client federated architecture, where the client sends differentially private (DP) perturbed task-specific data to the server's LLM. The LLM then generates synthetic data along with their corresponding rationales. This synthetic data is subsequently used for both LLM pruning and retraining processes. Additionally, we harness COT knowledge distillation, leveraging the synthetic data to further improve the retraining of structurally-pruned SLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPC-GPT across various text generation tasks. By compressing LLMs into task-specific SLMs, PPC-GPT not only achieves competitive performance but also prioritizes data privacy protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim W. Dornis, Sebastian Stober</p>
<p>Abstract: Training generative AI models requires extensive amounts of data. A common practice is to collect such data through web scraping. Yet, much of what has been and is collected is copyright protected. Its use may be copyright infringement. In the USA, AI developers rely on "fair use" and in Europe, the prevailing view is that the exception for "Text and Data Mining" (TDM) applies. In a recent interdisciplinary tandem-study, we have argued in detail that this is actually not the case because generative AI training fundamentally differs from TDM. In this article, we share our main findings and the implications for both public and corporate research on generative models. We further discuss how the phenomenon of training data memorization leads to copyright issues independently from the "fair use" and TDM exceptions. Finally, we outline how the ISMIR could contribute to the ongoing discussion about fair practices with respect to generative AI that satisfy all stakeholders.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the role of LLM-generated synthetic data in cyberbullying detection. We conduct a series of experiments where we replace some or all of the authentic data with synthetic data, or augment the authentic data with synthetic data. We find that synthetic cyberbullying data can be the basis for training a classifier for harm detection that reaches performance close to that of a classifier trained with authentic data. Combining authentic with synthetic data shows improvements over the baseline of training on authentic data alone for the test data for all three LLMs tried. These results highlight the viability of synthetic data as a scalable, ethically viable alternative in cyberbullying detection while emphasizing the critical impact of LLM selection on performance outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alan Zhu, Jiaqi Ma, Qiaozhu Mei</p>
<p>Abstract: As large graph datasets become increasingly common across many fields, sampling is often needed to reduce the graphs into manageable sizes. This procedure raises critical questions about representativeness as no sample can capture the properties of the original graph perfectly, and different parts of the graph are not evenly affected by the loss. Recent work has shown that the distances from the non-sampled nodes to the sampled nodes can be a quantitative indicator of bias and fairness in graph machine learning. However, to our knowledge, there is no method for evaluating how a sampling method affects the distribution of shortest-path distances without actually performing the sampling and shortest-path calculation.
  In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient framework for estimating the distribution of shortest-path distances to the sample, applicable to a wide range of sampling methods and graph structures. Our framework is faster than empirical methods and only requires the specification of degree distributions. We also extend our framework to handle graphs with community structures. While this introduces a decrease in accuracy, we demonstrate that our framework remains highly accurate on downstream comparison-based tasks.

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15955">Compression Barriers for Autoregressive Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Themistoklis Haris, Krzysztof Onak</p>
<p>Abstract: A key limitation of autoregressive Transformers is the large memory needed at inference-time to cache all previous key-value (KV) embeddings. Prior works address this by compressing the KV cache, but often assume specific structural properties of the embeddings. This raises the following natural question: Can truly sublinear space utilization be achieved without such assumptions? In this work, we answer this question in the negative. Any algorithm for attention-based token generation must use $\Theta(nd)$ space, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated so far and $d = \Omega(\log n)$ is the dimension of the KV embeddings. Our proof involves a reduction from a classic communication complexity problem and uses a randomized construction that leverages properties of projections in the spirit of the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma. For the low-dimensional regime $d = o(\log n)$, we show that any algorithm requires $\Omega(d\cdot e^d)$ space and prove, using tight bounds on covering numbers, that SubGen, proposed by Zandieh, Han, Mirrokni and Karbasi, matches this bound. Further, we investigate how sparsity assumptions enable token generation in truly sublinear space, presenting impossibility results and proposing a new KV cache compression algorithm for sliding window attention when the value cache outside the window is unmasked. Finally, we analyze token generation's time complexity, using an indistinguishability argument to prove that no non-adaptive algorithm can compute attention online in sublinear time for all tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayant Sachdev, Sean D Rosario, Abhijeet Phatak, He Wen, Swati Kirti, Chittaranjan Tripathy</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate query-product relevance labeling is indispensable to generate ground truth dataset for search ranking in e-commerce. Traditional approaches for annotating query-product pairs rely on human-based labeling services, which is expensive, time-consuming and prone to errors. In this work, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate query-product relevance labeling for large-scale e-commerce search. We use several publicly available and proprietary LLMs for this task, and conducted experiments on two open-source datasets and an in-house e-commerce search dataset. Using prompt engineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, In-context Learning (ICL), and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR), we show that LLM's performance has the potential to approach human-level accuracy on this task in a fraction of the time and cost required by human-labelers, thereby suggesting that our approach is more efficient than the conventional methods. We have generated query-product relevance labels using LLMs at scale, and are using them for evaluating improvements to our search algorithms. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to improve query-product relevance thus enhancing e-commerce search user experience. More importantly, this scalable alternative to human-annotation has significant implications for information retrieval domains including search and recommendation systems, where relevance scoring is crucial for optimizing the ranking of products and content to improve customer engagement and other conversion metrics.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16008">Exact Recovery of Sparse Binary Vectors from Generalized Linear Measurements</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Arya Mazumdar, Neha Sangwan</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of exact recovery of a $k$-sparse binary vector from generalized linear measurements (such as logistic regression). We analyze the linear estimation algorithm (Plan, Vershynin, Yudovina, 2017), and also show information theoretic lower bounds on the number of required measurements. As a consequence of our results, for noisy one bit quantized linear measurements ($\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$), we obtain a sample complexity of $O((k+\sigma^2)\log{n})$, where $\sigma^2$ is the noise variance. This is shown to be optimal due to the information theoretic lower bound. We also obtain tight sample complexity characterization for logistic regression.
  Since $\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$ is a strictly harder problem than noisy linear measurements ($\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$) because of added quantization, the same sample complexity is achievable for $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$. While this sample complexity can be obtained via the popular lasso algorithm, linear estimation is computationally more efficient. Our lower bound holds for any set of measurements for $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$, (similar bound was known for Gaussian measurement matrices) and is closely matched by the maximum-likelihood upper bound. For $\mathsf{SparseLinearReg}$, it was conjectured in Gamarnik and Zadik, 2017 that there is a statistical-computational gap and the number of measurements should be at least $(2k+\sigma^2)\log{n}$ for efficient algorithms to exist. It is worth noting that our results imply that there is no such statistical-computational gap for $\mathsf{1bCSbinary}$ and logistic regression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gautam Chandrasekaran, Adam R. Klivans, Lin Lin Lee, Konstantinos Stavropoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: We give the first provably efficient algorithms for learning neural networks with distribution shift. We work in the Testable Learning with Distribution Shift framework (TDS learning) of Klivans et al. (2024), where the learner receives labeled examples from a training distribution and unlabeled examples from a test distribution and must either output a hypothesis with low test error or reject if distribution shift is detected. No assumptions are made on the test distribution.
  All prior work in TDS learning focuses on classification, while here we must handle the setting of nonconvex regression. Our results apply to real-valued networks with arbitrary Lipschitz activations and work whenever the training distribution has strictly sub-exponential tails. For training distributions that are bounded and hypercontractive, we give a fully polynomial-time algorithm for TDS learning one hidden-layer networks with sigmoid activations. We achieve this by importing classical kernel methods into the TDS framework using data-dependent feature maps and a type of kernel matrix that couples samples from both train and test distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Vinden, Raeid Saqur, Zining Zhu, Frank Rudzicz</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Contrastive Similarity Space Embedding Algorithm (ContraSim), a novel framework for uncovering the global semantic relationships between daily financial headlines and market movements. ContraSim operates in two key stages: (I) Weighted Headline Augmentation, which generates augmented financial headlines along with a semantic fine-grained similarity score, and (II) Weighted Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (WSSCL), an extended version of classical self-supervised contrastive learning that uses the similarity metric to create a refined weighted embedding space. This embedding space clusters semantically similar headlines together, facilitating deeper market insights. Empirical results demonstrate that integrating ContraSim features into financial forecasting tasks improves classification accuracy from WSJ headlines by 7%. Moreover, leveraging an information density analysis, we find that the similarity spaces constructed by ContraSim intrinsically cluster days with homogeneous market movement directions, indicating that ContraSim captures market dynamics independent of ground truth labels. Additionally, ContraSim enables the identification of historical news days that closely resemble the headlines of the current day, providing analysts with actionable insights to predict market trends by referencing analogous past events.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Richard Abhulimhen, Negash Begashaw, Gurcan Comert, Chunheng Zhao, Pierluigi Pisu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, particularly in fields such as image classification. However, DNNs are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations are introduced to input images, leading to erroneous model outputs. In today's digital era, ensuring the security and integrity of images processed by DNNs is of critical importance. One of the most prominent adversarial attack methods is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which perturbs images in the direction of the loss gradient to deceive the model.
  This paper presents a novel approach for detecting and filtering FGSM adversarial attacks in image processing tasks. Our proposed method evaluates 10,000 images, each subjected to five different levels of perturbation, characterized by $\epsilon$ values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2. These perturbations are applied in the direction of the loss gradient. We demonstrate that our approach effectively filters adversarially perturbed images, mitigating the impact of FGSM attacks.
  The method is implemented in Python, and the source code is publicly available on GitHub for reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) threaten modern machine learning systems by enabling adversaries to steal models, exposing intellectual property and training data. With the increasing deployment of machine learning models in distributed computing environments, including cloud, edge, and federated learning settings, each paradigm introduces distinct vulnerabilities and challenges. Without a unified perspective on MEAs across these distributed environments, organizations risk fragmented defenses, inadequate risk assessments, and substantial economic and privacy losses. This survey is motivated by the urgent need to understand how the unique characteristics of cloud, edge, and federated deployments shape attack vectors and defense requirements. We systematically examine the evolution of attack methodologies and defense mechanisms across these environments, demonstrating how environmental factors influence security strategies in critical sectors such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and financial services. By synthesizing recent advances in MEAs research and discussing the limitations of current evaluation practices, this survey provides essential insights for developing robust and adaptive defense strategies. Our comprehensive approach highlights the importance of integrating protective measures across the entire distributed computing landscape to ensure the secure deployment of machine learning models.</p>

Despite the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in automating different aspects of the scientific process, automating rigorous experimentation remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose Curie, an AI agent framework designed to embed rigor into the experimentation process through three key components: an intra-agent rigor module to enhance reliability, an inter-agent rigor module to maintain methodical control, and an experiment knowledge module to enhance interpretability. To evaluate Curie, we design a novel experimental benchmark composed of 46 questions across four computer science domains, derived from influential research papers, and widely adopted open-source projects. Compared to the strongest baseline tested, we achieve a 3.4$\times$ improvement in correctly answering experimental questions.Curie is open-sourced at https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficient task allocation among multiple robots is crucial for optimizing productivity in modern warehouses, particularly in response to the increasing demands of online order fulfillment. This paper addresses the real-time multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem in dynamic warehouse environments, where tasks emerge with specified start and end locations. The objective is to minimize both the total travel distance of robots and delays in task completion, while also considering practical constraints such as battery management and collision avoidance. We introduce MRTAgent, a dual-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework inspired by self-play, designed to optimize task assignments and robot selection to ensure timely task execution. For safe navigation, a modified linear quadratic controller (LQR) approach is employed. To the best of our knowledge, MRTAgent is the first framework to address all critical aspects of practical MRTA problems while supporting continuous robot movements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable performance in domains such as mathematics, programming, and literary creation. However, most studies have focused on semantic memory-based question answering, neglecting LLMs' potential to handle episodic memory (EM)-related queries. This oversight has led to suboptimal performance in applications requiring EM, including emotional companionship, personal AI assistants, and AI teachers. To address this gap, we introduce Echo, a LLM enhanced with temporal episodic memory. We propose a Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework that guides the model in generating multi-turn, complex scenario episodic memory dialogue data (EM-Train). Temporal information is innovatively incorporated into the LLM training process, and Echo is trained using the EM-Train. Furthermore, We develop an EM-Test benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' episodic memory capabilities. The EM-Test assesses performance across various time spans and difficulty levels, providing a comprehensive evaluation of multi-turn episodic memory dialogues. Our experiments demonstrate that Echo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on EM-Test. Additionally, a qualitative analysis reveals Echo's potential to exhibit human-like episodic memory capabilities. We will open-source all datasets, code, and model weights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Swadhin Das, Saarthak Gupta, and Kamal Kumar, Raksha Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) is the process of generating meaningful descriptions from remote sensing images. Recently, it has gained significant attention, with encoder-decoder models serving as the backbone for generating meaningful captions. The encoder extracts essential visual features from the input image, transforming them into a compact representation, while the decoder utilizes this representation to generate coherent textual descriptions. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information. The decoder has been well explored for text generation, whereas the encoder remains relatively unexplored. However, optimizing the encoder is crucial as it directly influences the richness of extracted features, which in turn affects the quality of generated captions. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate twelve different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures within a transformer-based encoder framework to assess their effectiveness in RSIC. The evaluation consists of two stages: first, a numerical analysis categorizes CNNs into different clusters, based on their performance. The best performing CNNs are then subjected to human evaluation from a human-centric perspective by a human annotator. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different search strategies, namely greedy search and beam search, to ensure the best caption. The results highlight the critical role of encoder selection in improving captioning performance, demonstrating that specific CNN architectures significantly enhance the quality of generated descriptions for remote sensing images. By providing a detailed comparison of multiple encoders, this study offers valuable insights to guide advances in transformer-based image captioning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilesh Kumar Sahu, Snehil Gupta, Haroon R Lone</p>
<p>Abstract: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a widespread mental health condition, yet its lack of objective markers hinders timely detection and intervention. While previous research has focused on behavioral and non-verbal markers of SAD in structured activities (e.g., speeches or interviews), these settings fail to replicate real-world, unstructured social interactions fully. Identifying non-verbal markers in naturalistic, unstaged environments is essential for developing ubiquitous and non-intrusive monitoring solutions. To address this gap, we present AnxietyFaceTrack, a study leveraging facial video analysis to detect anxiety in unstaged social settings. A cohort of 91 participants engaged in a social setting with unfamiliar individuals and their facial videos were recorded using a low-cost smartphone camera. We examined facial features, including eye movements, head position, facial landmarks, and facial action units, and used self-reported survey data to establish ground truth for multiclass (anxious, neutral, non-anxious) and binary (e.g., anxious vs. neutral) classifications. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest classifier trained on the top 20% of features achieved the highest accuracy of 91.0% for multiclass classification and an average accuracy of 92.33% across binary classifications. Notably, head position and facial landmarks yielded the best performance for individual facial regions, achieving 85.0% and 88.0% accuracy, respectively, in multiclass classification, and 89.66% and 91.0% accuracy, respectively, across binary classifications. This study introduces a non-intrusive, cost-effective solution that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday smartphones for continuous anxiety monitoring, offering a promising pathway for early detection and intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Ge, Hengrui Cai, Runzhe Wan, Yang Xu, Rui Song</p>
<p>Abstract: To make effective decisions, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the causal relationships among actions, environments, and outcomes. This review aims to surface three crucial aspects of decision-making through a causal lens: 1) the discovery of causal relationships through causal structure learning, 2) understanding the impacts of these relationships through causal effect learning, and 3) applying the knowledge gained from the first two aspects to support decision making via causal policy learning. Moreover, we identify challenges that hinder the broader utilization of causal decision-making and discuss recent advances in overcoming these challenges. Finally, we provide future research directions to address these challenges and to further enhance the implementation of causal decision-making in practice, with real-world applications illustrated based on the proposed causal decision-making. We aim to offer a comprehensive methodology and practical implementation framework by consolidating various methods in this area into a Python-based collection.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents linear DML models for causal inference using the simplest Python code on a Jupyter notebook based on an Anaconda platform and compares the performance of different DML models. The results show that current Library API technology is not yet sufficient to enable novice Python users to build qualified and high-quality DML models with the simplest coding approach. Novice users attempting to perform DML causal inference using Python still have to improve their mathematical and computer knowledge to adapt to more flexible DML programming. Additionally, the issue of mismatched outcome variable dimensions is also widespread when building linear DML models in Jupyter notebook.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Henrik Nolte, Miriam Rateike, Mich\`ele Finck</p>
<p>Abstract: The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) establishes different legal principles for different types of AI systems. While prior work has sought to clarify some of these principles, little attention has been paid to robustness and cybersecurity. This paper aims to fill this gap. We identify legal challenges and shortcomings in provisions related to robustness and cybersecurity for high-risk AI systems (Art. 15 AIA) and general-purpose AI models (Art. 55 AIA). We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand resilience against performance disruptions. Furthermore, we assess potential challenges in implementing these provisions in light of recent advancements in the machine learning (ML) literature. Our analysis informs efforts to develop harmonized standards, guidelines by the European Commission, as well as benchmarks and measurement methodologies under Art. 15(2) AIA. With this, we seek to bridge the gap between legal terminology and ML research, fostering a better alignment between research and implementation efforts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengchun Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is concerned with how intelligence agents take actions in a given environment to maximize the cumulative reward they receive. In healthcare, applying RL algorithms could assist patients in improving their health status. In ride-sharing platforms, applying RL algorithms could increase drivers' income and customer satisfaction. Over the past decade, RL has been arguably one of the most vibrant research frontiers in machine learning. Nevertheless, statistics as a field, as opposed to computer science, has only recently begun to engage with RL both in depth and in breadth. This paper present a selective review of statistical inferential tools for RL, covering both hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. Our goal is to highlight the value of statistical inference in RL for both the statistics and machine learning communities, and to promote the broader application of classical statistical inference tools in this vibrant area of research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masoud Shokrnezhad, Tarik Taleb</p>
<p>Abstract: 6G networks aim to achieve global coverage, massive connectivity, and ultra-stringent requirements. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) and Semantic Communication (SemCom) are essential for realizing these goals, yet they introduce considerable complexity in resource orchestration. Drawing inspiration from research in robotics, a viable solution to manage this complexity is the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the use of LLMs in network orchestration has recently gained attention, existing solutions have not sufficiently addressed LLM hallucinations or their adaptation to network dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a framework called Autonomous Reinforcement Coordination (ARC) for a SemCom-enabled SAGIN. This framework employs an LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) monitors services, users, and resources and processes the collected data, while a Hierarchical Action Planner (HAP) orchestrates resources. ARC decomposes orchestration into two tiers, utilizing LLMs for high-level planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for low-level decision-making, in alignment with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The LLMs utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for few-shot learning, empowered by contrastive learning, while the RL agents employ replay buffer management for continual learning, thereby achieving efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ARC, along with a comprehensive discussion on potential future research directions to enhance and upgrade ARC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anindita Chattopadhyay, Vijay Kumar Sutrakar</p>
<p>Abstract: A critical stage in the evolving landscape of VLSI design is the design phase that is transformed into register-transfer level (RTL), which specifies system functionality through hardware description languages like Verilog. Generally, evaluating the quality of an RTL design demands full synthesis via electronic design automation (EDA) tool is time-consuming process that is not well-suited to rapid design iteration and optimization. Although recent breakthroughs in machine Learning (ML) have brought early prediction models, these methods usually do not provide robust and generalizable solutions with respect to a wide range of RTL designs. This paper proposes a pre-synthesis framework that makes early estimation of power, performance and area (PPA) metrics directly from the hardware description language (HDL) code making direct use of library files instead of toggle files. The proposed framework introduces a bit-level representation referred to as the simple operator graph (SOG), which uses single-bit operators to generate a generalized and flexible structure that closely mirrors the characteristics of post synthesis design. The proposed model bridges the RTL and post-synthesis design, which will help in precisely predicting key metrics. The proposed tree-based ML framework shows superior predictive performance PPA estimation. Validation is carried out on 147 distinct RTL designs. The proposed model with 147 different designs shows accuracy of 98%, 98%, and 90% for WNS, TNS and power, respectively, indicates significant accuracy improvements relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongsheng Chen, Yu Feng, Xun Li, Mingya Qu, Peng Luo, Liqiu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the high-order relationship between urban form and function is essential for modeling the underlying mechanisms of sustainable urban systems. Nevertheless, it is challenging to establish an accurate data representation for complex urban forms that are readily explicable in human terms. This study proposed the concept of core urban morphology representation and developed an explainable deep learning framework for explicably symbolizing complex urban forms into the novel representation, which we call CoMo. By interpretating the well-trained deep learning model with a stable weighted F1-score of 89.14%, CoMo presents a promising approach for revealing links between urban function and urban form in terms of core urban morphology representation. Using Boston as a study area, we analyzed the core urban forms at the individual-building, block, and neighborhood level that are important to corresponding urban functions. The residential core forms follow a gradual morphological pattern along the urban spine, which is consistent with a center-urban-suburban transition. Furthermore, we prove that urban morphology directly affects land use efficiency, which has a significantly strong correlation with the location (R2=0.721, p<0.001). Overall, CoMo can explicably symbolize urban forms, provide evidence for the classic urban location theory, and offer mechanistic insights for digital twins.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wandong Sun, Long Chen, Yongbo Su, Baoshi Cao, Yang Liu, Zongwu Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots are designed to navigate environments accessible to humans using their legs. However, classical research has primarily focused on controlled laboratory settings, resulting in a gap in developing controllers for navigating complex real-world terrains. This challenge mainly arises from the limitations and noise in sensor data, which hinder the robot's understanding of itself and the environment. In this study, we introduce World Model Reconstruction (WMR), an end-to-end learning-based approach for blind humanoid locomotion across challenging terrains. We propose training an estimator to explicitly reconstruct the world state and utilize it to enhance the locomotion policy. The locomotion policy takes inputs entirely from the reconstructed information. The policy and the estimator are trained jointly; however, the gradient between them is intentionally cut off. This ensures that the estimator focuses solely on world reconstruction, independent of the locomotion policy's updates. We evaluated our model on rough, deformable, and slippery surfaces in real-world scenarios, demonstrating robust adaptability and resistance to interference. The robot successfully completed a 3.2 km hike without any human assistance, mastering terrains covered with ice and snow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xintong Wang, Xiaofei Guan, Ling Guo, Hao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian filtering for high-dimensional nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems is a fundamental yet challenging problem in many fields of science and engineering. Existing methods face significant obstacles: Gaussian-based filters struggle with non-Gaussian distributions, sequential Monte Carlo methods are computationally intensive and prone to particle degeneracy in high dimensions, and deep learning approaches often fail to balance accuracy and efficiency in complex filtering tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-based Bayesian filter (FBF) that integrates normalizing flows to construct a latent linear state-space model with Gaussian filtering distributions. This framework enables efficient density estimation and sampling through invertible transformations provided by normalizing flows, which can be learned directly from data, thereby eliminating the need for prior knowledge of system dynamics or observation models. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of FBF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jenelle Feather, Meenakshi Khosla, N. Apurva Ratan Murty, Aran Nayebi</p>
<p>Abstract: What makes an artificial system a good model of intelligence? The classical test proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial agent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral similarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different internal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling biological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond behavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a model's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This position paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is incomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI Turing Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and \emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations that are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured individual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and the brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain. While the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the only universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for evaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift the discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic and testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations, providing a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heng Chang, Liang Gu, Cheng Hu, Zhinan Zhang, Hong Zhu, Yuhui Xu, Yuan Fang, Zhen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is a task that aims to improve the recommendation performance in a target domain by leveraging the information from source domains. Contrastive learning methods have been widely adopted among intra-domain (intra-CL) and inter-domain (inter-CL) users/items for their representation learning and knowledge transfer during the matching stage of CDR. However, we observe that directly employing contrastive learning on mixed-up intra-CL and inter-CL tasks ignores the difficulty of learning from inter-domain over learning from intra-domain, and thus could cause severe training instability. Therefore, this instability deteriorates the representation learning process and hurts the quality of generated embeddings. To this end, we propose a novel framework named SCCDR built up on a separated intra-CL and inter-CL paradigm and a stop-gradient operation to handle the drawback. Specifically, SCCDR comprises two specialized curriculum stages: intra-inter separation and inter-domain curriculum scheduling. The former stage explicitly uses two distinct contrastive views for the intra-CL task in the source and target domains, respectively. Meanwhile, the latter stage deliberately tackles the inter-CL tasks with a curriculum scheduling strategy that derives effective curricula by accounting for the difficulty of negative samples anchored by overlapping users. Empirical experiments on various open-source datasets and an offline proprietary industrial dataset extracted from a real-world recommender system, and an online A/B test verify that SCCDR achieves state-of-the-art performance over multiple baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Li, Jia Qi Yip, Tianyu Fan, Eng Siong Chng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Audio Codec (NAC) models have inspired their use in various speech processing tasks, including speech enhancement (SE). In this work, we propose a novel, efficient SE approach by leveraging the pre-quantization output of a pretrained NAC encoder. Unlike prior NAC-based SE methods, which process discrete speech tokens using Language Models (LMs), we perform SE within the continuous embedding space of the pretrained NAC, which is highly compressed along the time dimension for efficient representation. Our lightweight SE model, optimized through an embedding-level loss, delivers results comparable to SE baselines trained on larger datasets, with a significantly lower real-time factor of 0.005. Additionally, our method achieves a low GMAC of 3.94, reducing complexity 18-fold compared to Sepformer in a simulated cloud-based audio transmission environment. This work highlights a new, efficient NAC-based SE solution, particularly suitable for cloud applications where NAC is used to compress audio before transmission.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Srivastava, Durgesh Kumar, Ram Jiwari, Sandeep Seth, Deepak Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: The variability in ECG readings influenced by individual patient characteristics has posed a considerable challenge to adopting automated ECG analysis in clinical settings. A novel feature fusion technique termed SACC (Self Attentive Canonical Correlation) was proposed to address this. This technique is combined with DPN (Dual Pathway Network) and depth-wise separable convolution to create a robust, interpretable, and fast end-to-end arrhythmia classification model named rECGnition_v2.0 (robust ECG abnormality detection). This study uses MIT-BIH, INCARTDB and EDB dataset to evaluate the efficiency of rECGnition_v2.0 for various classes of arrhythmias. To investigate the influence of constituting model components, various ablation studies were performed, i.e. simple concatenation, CCA and proposed SACC were compared, while the importance of global and local ECG features were tested using DPN rECGnition_v2.0 model and vice versa. It was also benchmarked with state-of-the-art CNN models for overall accuracy vs model parameters, FLOPs, memory requirements, and prediction time. Furthermore, the inner working of the model was interpreted by comparing the activation locations in ECG before and after the SACC layer. rECGnition_v2.0 showed a remarkable accuracy of 98.07% and an F1-score of 98.05% for classifying ten distinct classes of arrhythmia with just 82.7M FLOPs per sample, thereby going beyond the performance metrics of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by utilizing MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. Similarly, on INCARTDB and EDB datasets, excellent F1-scores of 98.01% and 96.21% respectively was achieved for AAMI classification. The compact architectural footprint of the rECGnition_v2.0, characterized by its lesser trainable parameters and diminished computational demands, unfurled several advantages including interpretability and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yedi Zhang, Lei Huang, Pengfei Gao, Fu Song, Jun Sun, Jin Song Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of neural network security, the resilience of neural networks against bit-flip attacks (i.e., an attacker maliciously flips an extremely small amount of bits within its parameter storage memory system to induce harmful behavior), has emerged as a relevant area of research. Existing studies suggest that quantization may serve as a viable defense against such attacks. Recognizing the documented susceptibility of real-valued neural networks to such attacks and the comparative robustness of quantized neural networks (QNNs), in this work, we introduce BFAVerifier, the first verification framework designed to formally verify the absence of bit-flip attacks or to identify all vulnerable parameters in a sound and rigorous manner. BFAVerifier comprises two integral components: an abstraction-based method and an MILP-based method. Specifically, we first conduct a reachability analysis with respect to symbolic parameters that represent the potential bit-flip attacks, based on a novel abstract domain with a sound guarantee. If the reachability analysis fails to prove the resilience of such attacks, then we encode this verification problem into an equivalent MILP problem which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Therefore, BFAVerifier is sound, complete, and reasonably efficient. We conduct extensive experiments, which demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency across various network architectures, quantization bit-widths, and adversary capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan-Anh Yang, Truong-Son Hy, Phuong D. Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multiscale object-based graph neural network called MOB-GCN for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The central aim of this study is to enhance feature extraction and classification performance by utilizing multiscale object-based image analysis (OBIA). Traditional pixel-based methods often suffer from low accuracy and speckle noise, while single-scale OBIA approaches may overlook crucial information of image objects at different levels of detail. MOB-GCN overcomes these challenges by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales, leveraging the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture to capture both fine-grained and global spatial patterns. MOB-GCN addresses this issue by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales to improve classification results using the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that can model fine-grained and global spatial patterns. By constructing a dynamic multiscale graph hierarchy, MOB-GCN offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate details and global context of HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that MOB-GCN consistently outperforms single-scale graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise reduction, particularly when labeled data is limited. The implementation of MOB-GCN is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI</p>

We introduce a formalism based on the replica method to characterize the process in the infinite-size limit in terms of a few order parameters, and, in particular, we provide criteria for the feasibility of sampling.
  We show that, in the case of the spherical perceptron problem with negative stability, approximate uniform sampling is achievable across the entire replica symmetric region of the phase diagram. In contrast, for the binary perceptron, uniform sampling via diffusion invariably fails due to the overlap gap property exhibited by the typical set of solutions. We discuss the first steps in defining alternative measures that can be efficiently sampled.</p>

<p>Abstract: Alignment with human preferences is commonly framed using a universal reward function, even though human preferences are inherently heterogeneous. We formalize this heterogeneity by introducing user types and examine the limits of the homogeneity assumption. We show that aligning to heterogeneous preferences with a single policy is best achieved using the average reward across user types. However, this requires additional information about annotators. We examine improvements under different information settings, focusing on direct alignment methods. We find that minimal information can yield first-order improvements, while full feedback from each user type leads to consistent learning of the optimal policy. Surprisingly, however, no sample-efficient consistent direct loss exists in this latter setting. These results reveal a fundamental tension between consistency and sample efficiency in direct policy alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a new method for generating confidence sets within the split conformal prediction framework. Our method performs a trainable transformation of any given conformity score to improve conditional coverage while ensuring exact marginal coverage. The transformation is based on an estimate of the conditional quantile of conformity scores. The resulting method is particularly beneficial for constructing adaptive confidence sets in multi-output problems where standard conformal quantile regression approaches have limited applicability. We develop a theoretical bound that captures the influence of the accuracy of the quantile estimate on the approximate conditional validity, unlike classical bounds for conformal prediction methods that only offer marginal coverage. We experimentally show that our method is highly adaptive to the local data structure and outperforms existing methods in terms of conditional coverage, improving the reliability of statistical inference in various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deeparnab Chakrabarty, Xi Chen, Simeon Ristic, C. Seshadhri, Erik Waingarten</p>
<p>Abstract: We study monotonicity testing of high-dimensional distributions on $\{-1,1\}^n$ in the model of subcube conditioning, suggested and studied by Canonne, Ron, and Servedio~\cite{CRS15} and Bhattacharyya and Chakraborty~\cite{BC18}. Previous work shows that the \emph{sample complexity} of monotonicity testing must be exponential in $n$ (Rubinfeld, Vasilian~\cite{RV20}, and Aliakbarpour, Gouleakis, Peebles, Rubinfeld, Yodpinyanee~\cite{AGPRY19}). We show that the subcube \emph{query complexity} is $\tilde{\Theta}(n/\varepsilon^2)$, by proving nearly matching upper and lower bounds. Our work is the first to use directed isoperimetric inequalities (developed for function monotonicity testing) for analyzing a distribution testing algorithm. Along the way, we generalize an inequality of Khot, Minzer, and Safra~\cite{KMS18} to real-valued functions on $\{-1,1\}^n$.
  We also study uniformity testing of distributions that are promised to be monotone, a problem introduced by Rubinfeld, Servedio~\cite{RS09} , using subcube conditioning. We show that the query complexity is $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2)$. Our work proves the lower bound, which matches (up to poly-logarithmic factors) the uniformity testing upper bound for general distributions (Canonne, Chen, Kamath, Levi, Waingarten~\cite{CCKLW21}). Hence, we show that monotonicity does not help, beyond logarithmic factors, in testing uniformity of distributions with subcube conditional queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sophie Xhonneux, David Dobre, Mehrnaz Mohfakhami, Leo Schwinn, Gauthier Gidel</p>
<p>Abstract: Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) based on fine-tuning rely on dramatically changing the output distribution of the model when faced with a harmful request, shifting it from an unsafe answer to a refusal to respond. These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex G. C. de S\'a, David B. Ascher</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been playing important roles in drug discovery in the past years by providing (pre-)screening tools for prioritising chemical compounds to pass through wet lab experiments. One of the main ML tasks in drug discovery is to build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an activity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound behaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods exist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's personalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since the chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact leads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by the model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to solve this issue, outputting tailored ML algorithms to the data at hand. Although an important task, AutoML has not been practically used to assist cheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few works related to the field. To address these challenges, this work introduces Auto-ADMET, an interpretable evolutionary-based AutoML method for chemical ADMET property prediction. Auto-ADMET employs a Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) method with a Bayesian Network Model to achieve comparable or better predictive performance against three alternative methods -- standard GGP method, pkCSM and XGBOOST model -- on 12 benchmark chemical ADMET property prediction datasets. The use of a Bayesian Network model on Auto-ADMET's evolutionary process assisted in both shaping the search procedure and interpreting the causes of its AutoML performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchen Ji, Neeloy Chakraborty, Andre Schreiber, Katherine Driggs-Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: As automated vehicles enter public roads, safety in a near-infinite number of driving scenarios becomes one of the major concerns for the widespread adoption of fully autonomous driving. The ability to detect anomalous situations outside of the operational design domain is a key component in self-driving cars, enabling us to mitigate the impact of abnormal ego behaviors and to realize trustworthy driving systems. On-road anomaly detection in egocentric videos remains a challenging problem due to the difficulties introduced by complex and interactive scenarios. We conduct a holistic analysis of common on-road anomaly patterns, from which we propose three unsupervised anomaly detection experts: a scene expert that focuses on frame-level appearances to detect abnormal scenes and unexpected scene motions; an interaction expert that models normal relative motions between two road participants and raises alarms whenever anomalous interactions emerge; and a behavior expert which monitors abnormal behaviors of individual objects by future trajectory prediction. To combine the strengths of all the modules, we propose an expert ensemble (Xen) using a Kalman filter, in which the final anomaly score is absorbed as one of the states and the observations are generated by the experts. Our experiments employ a novel evaluation protocol for realistic model performance, demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance than previous methods, and show that our framework has potential in classifying anomaly types using unsupervised learning on a large-scale on-road anomaly dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangil Han, Kyoowon Kim, Sungkyu Jung</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the theoretical properties of subspace recovery using Winsorized Principal Component Analysis (WPCA), utilizing a common data transformation technique that caps extreme values to mitigate the impact of outliers. Despite the widespread use of winsorization in various tasks of multivariate analysis, its theoretical properties, particularly for subspace recovery, have received limited attention. We provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy of WPCA, showing that increasing the number of samples while decreasing the proportion of outliers guarantees the consistency of the sample subspaces from WPCA with respect to the true population subspace. Furthermore, we establish perturbation bounds that ensure the WPCA subspace obtained from contaminated data remains close to the subspace recovered from pure data. Additionally, we extend the classical notion of breakdown points to subspace-valued statistics and derive lower bounds for the breakdown points of WPCA. Our analysis demonstrates that WPCA exhibits strong robustness to outliers while maintaining consistency under mild assumptions. A toy example is provided to numerically illustrate the behavior of the upper bounds for perturbation bounds and breakdown points, emphasizing winsorization's utility in subspace recovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: Professionals increasingly use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance their capabilities and assist with task execution. While prior research has examined these uses separately, their potential interaction remains underexplored. We propose that AI-driven training (tutor effect) and AI-assisted task completion (tool effect) can be complementary and test this hypothesis in the context of lung cancer diagnosis. In a field experiment with 334 medical students, we manipulated AI deployment in training, in practice, and in both. Our findings reveal that while AI-integrated training and AI assistance independently improved diagnostic performance, their combination yielded the highest accuracy. These results underscore AI's dual role in enhancing human performance through both learning and real-time support, offering insights into AI deployment in professional settings where human expertise remains essential.</p>

<p>Abstract: The next token prediction loss is the dominant self-supervised training objective for large language models and has achieved promising results in a variety of downstream tasks. However, upon closer investigation of this objective, we find that it lacks an understanding of sequence-level signals, leading to a mismatch between training and inference processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a contrastive preference optimization (CPO) procedure that can inject sequence-level information into the language model at any training stage without expensive human labeled data. Our experiments show that the proposed objective surpasses the next token prediction in terms of win rate in the instruction-following and text generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirmoez Jamaat, Yalan Song, Farshid Rahmani, Jiangtao Liu, Kathryn Lawson, Chaopeng Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) enables hydrologic models to update their internal states using near-real-time observations for more accurate forecasts. With deep neural networks like long short-term memory (LSTM), using either lagged observations as inputs (called "data integration") or variational DA has shown success in improving forecasts. However, it is unclear which methods are performant or optimal for physics-informed machine learning ("differentiable") models, which represent only a small amount of physically-meaningful states while using deep networks to supply parameters or missing processes. Here we developed variational DA methods for differentiable models, including optimizing adjusters for just precipitation data, just model internal hydrological states, or both. Our results demonstrated that differentiable streamflow models using the CAMELS dataset can benefit strongly and equivalently from variational DA as LSTM, with one-day lead time median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) elevated from 0.75 to 0.82. The resulting forecast matched or outperformed LSTM with DA in the eastern, northwestern, and central Great Plains regions of the conterminous United States. Both precipitation and state adjusters were needed to achieve these results, with the latter being substantially more effective on its own, and the former adding moderate benefits for high flows. Our DA framework does not need systematic training data and could serve as a practical DA scheme for whole river networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In critical care settings, where precise and timely interventions are crucial for health outcomes, evaluating disparities in patient outcomes is essential. Current approaches often fail to fully capture the impact of respiratory support interventions on individuals affected by social determinants of health. While attributes such as gender, race, and age are commonly assessed and provide valuable insights, they offer only a partial view of the complexities faced by diverse populations. In this study, we focus on two clinically motivated tasks: prolonged mechanical ventilation and successful weaning. Additionally, we conduct fairness audits on the models' predictions across demographic groups and social determinants of health to better understand health inequities in respiratory interventions within the intensive care unit. Furthermore, we release a temporal benchmark dataset, verified by clinical experts, to facilitate benchmarking of clinical respiratory intervention tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Parody is an emerging phenomenon on social media, where individuals imitate a role or position opposite to their own, often for humor, provocation, or controversy. Detecting and analyzing parody can be challenging and is often reliant on context, yet it plays a crucial role in understanding cultural values, promoting subcultures, and enhancing self-expression. However, the study of parody is hindered by limited available data and deficient diversity in current datasets. To bridge this gap, we built seven parody datasets from both English and Chinese corpora, with 14,755 annotated users and 21,210 annotated comments in total. To provide sufficient context information, we also collect replies and construct user-interaction graphs to provide richer contextual information, which is lacking in existing datasets. With these datasets, we test traditional methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) on three key tasks: (1) parody detection, (2) comment sentiment analysis with parody, and (3) user sentiment analysis with parody. Our extensive experiments reveal that parody-related tasks still remain challenging for all models, and contextual information plays a critical role. Interestingly, we find that, in certain scenarios, traditional sentence embedding methods combined with simple classifiers can outperform advanced LLMs, i.e. DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o3, highlighting parody as a significant challenge for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thanh Trung Vu, Andreas Kofler, Kostas Papafitsoros</p>
<p>Abstract: We extend a recently introduced deep unrolling framework for learning spatially varying regularisation parameters in inverse imaging problems to the case of Total Generalised Variation (TGV). The framework combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) inferring the two spatially varying TGV parameters with an unrolled algorithmic scheme that solves the corresponding variational problem. The two subnetworks are jointly trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion and as such the CNN learns to compute those parameters that drive the reconstructed images as close to the ground truth as possible. Numerical results in image denoising and MRI reconstruction show a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement compared to the best TGV scalar parameter case as well as to other approaches employing spatially varying parameters computed by unsupervised methods. We also observe that the inferred spatially varying parameter maps have a consistent structure near the image edges, asking for further theoretical investigations. In particular, the parameter that weighs the first-order TGV term has a triple-edge structure with alternating high-low-high values whereas the one that weighs the second-order term attains small values in a large neighbourhood around the edges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pankaj Yadav, Gulshan Sihag, Vivek Vijay</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are used in diverse domains, many of which face significant challenges due to data imbalance. Studies have explored various approaches to address the issue, like data preprocessing, cost-sensitive learning, and ensemble methods. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) showed immense potential as a data preprocessing technique that generates good quality synthetic data. This study employs a systematic mapping methodology to analyze 3041 papers on GAN-based sampling techniques for imbalanced data sourced from four digital libraries. A filtering process identified 100 key studies spanning domains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, this research introduces three categorization mappings as application domains, GAN techniques, and GAN variants used to handle the imbalanced nature of the data. GAN-based over-sampling emerges as an effective preprocessing method. Advanced architectures and tailored frameworks helped GANs to improve further in the case of data imbalance. GAN variants like vanilla GAN, CTGAN, and CGAN show great adaptability in structured imbalanced data cases. Interest in GANs for imbalanced data has grown tremendously, touching a peak in recent years, with journals and conferences playing crucial roles in transmitting foundational theories and practical applications. While with these advances, none of the reviewed studies explicitly explore hybridized GAN frameworks with diffusion models or reinforcement learning techniques. This gap leads to a future research idea develop innovative approaches for effectively handling data imbalance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Cai Chen, Yi Pin Xu, Yang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting parameters from technical documentation is crucial for ensuring design precision and simulation reliability in electronic design. However, current methods struggle to handle high-dimensional design data and meet the demands of real-time processing. In electronic design automation (EDA), engineers often manually search through extensive documents to retrieve component parameters required for constructing PySpice models, a process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the extraction of parameters and the generation of PySpice models directly from datasheets. Our framework introduces three Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based techniques: (1) Targeted Document Retrieval (TDR), which enables the rapid identification of relevant technical sections; (2) Iterative Retrieval Optimization (IRO), which refines the parameter search through iterative improvements; and (3) Preference Optimization (PO), which dynamically prioritizes key document sections based on relevance. Experimental results show that applying all three methods together improves retrieval precision by 47.69% and reduces processing latency by 37.84%. Furthermore, effect size analysis using Cohen's d reveals that PO significantly reduces latency, while IRO contributes most to precision enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of our framework to streamline EDA processes, enhance design accuracy, and shorten development timelines. Additionally, our algorithm has model-agnostic generalization, meaning it can improve parameter search performance across different LLMs.</p>

However, the current document layout analysis model is aimed at various types of documents and is not suitable for electronic device documents.

The training method adopts the focus and global knowledge distillation method, and a model suitable for electronic device documents is obtained, which can divide the contents of electronic device documents into 21 categories. It has better average accuracy and average recall rate. It also greatly improves the speed of model checking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scoring functions constructed by transforming the realization and prediction variables of (strictly) consistent scoring functions have been widely studied empirically, yet their theoretical foundations remain unexplored. To address this gap, we establish formal characterizations of (strict) consistency for these transformed scoring functions and their elicitable functionals. Our analysis focuses on two interrelated cases: (a) transformations applied exclusively to the realization variable, and (b) bijective transformations applied jointly to both realization and prediction variables. We formulate analogous characterizations for (strict) identification functions. The resulting theoretical framework is broadly applicable to statistical and machine learning methodologies. When applied to Bregman and expectile scoring functions, our framework shows how it enables two critical advances: (a) rigorous interpretation of prior empirical findings from models trained with transformed scoring functions, and (b) systematic construction of novel identifiable and elicitable functionals, specifically the g-transformed expectation and g-transformed expectile. By unifying theoretical insights with practical applications, this work advances principled methodologies for designing scoring functions in complex predictive tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform when tackling quantitative management decision problems in a zero-shot setting. Drawing on 900 responses generated by five leading models across 20 diverse managerial scenarios, our analysis explores whether these base models can deliver accurate numerical decisions under varying presentation formats, scenario complexities, and repeated attempts. Contrary to prior findings, we observed no significant effects of text presentation format (direct, narrative, or tabular) or text length on accuracy. However, scenario complexity -- particularly in terms of constraints and irrelevant parameters -- strongly influenced performance, often degrading accuracy. Surprisingly, the models handled tasks requiring multiple solution steps more effectively than expected. Notably, only 28.8\% of responses were exactly correct, highlighting limitations in precision. We further found no significant ``learning effect'' across iterations: performance remained stable across repeated queries. Nonetheless, significant variations emerged among the five tested LLMs, with some showing superior binary accuracy. Overall, these findings underscore both the promise and the pitfalls of harnessing LLMs for complex quantitative decision-making, informing managers and researchers about optimal deployment strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Access to legal knowledge in India is often hindered by a lack of awareness, misinformation and limited accessibility to judicial resources. Many individuals struggle to navigate complex legal frameworks, leading to the frequent misuse of laws and inadequate legal protection. To address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based legal chatbot powered by vectorstore oriented FAISS for efficient and accurate legal information retrieval. Unlike traditional chatbots, our model is trained using an extensive dataset comprising legal books, official documentation and the Indian Constitution, ensuring accurate responses to even the most complex or misleading legal queries. The chatbot leverages FAISS for rapid vector-based search, significantly improving retrieval speed and accuracy. It is also prompt-engineered to handle twisted or ambiguous legal questions, reducing the chances of incorrect interpretations. Apart from its core functionality of answering legal queries, the platform includes additional features such as real-time legal news updates, legal blogs, and access to law-related books, making it a comprehensive resource for users. By integrating advanced AI techniques with an optimized retrieval system, our chatbot aims to democratize legal knowledge, enhance legal literacy, and prevent the spread of misinformation. The study demonstrates that our approach effectively improves legal accessibility while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency, thereby contributing to a more informed and empowered society.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable image understanding and dialogue capabilities, allowing them to handle a variety of visual question answering tasks. However, their widespread availability raises concerns about unauthorized usage and copyright infringement, where users or individuals can develop their own LVLMs by fine-tuning published models. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Parameter Learning Attack (PLA) for tracking the copyright of LVLMs without modifying the original model. Specifically, we construct adversarial images through targeted attacks against the original model, enabling it to generate specific outputs. To ensure these attacks remain effective on potential fine-tuned models to trigger copyright tracking, we allow the original model to learn the trigger images by updating parameters in the opposite direction during the adversarial attack process. Notably, the proposed method can be applied after the release of the original model, thus not affecting the model's performance and behavior. To simulate real-world applications, we fine-tune the original model using various strategies across diverse datasets, creating a range of models for copyright verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can more effectively identify the original copyright of fine-tuned models compared to baseline methods. Therefore, this work provides a powerful tool for tracking copyrights and detecting unlicensed usage of LVLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Planning with options -- a sequence of primitive actions -- has been shown effective in reinforcement learning within complex environments. Previous studies have focused on planning with predefined options or learned options through expert demonstration data. Inspired by MuZero, which learns superhuman heuristics without any human knowledge, we propose a novel approach, named OptionZero. OptionZero incorporates an option network into MuZero, providing autonomous discovery of options through self-play games. Furthermore, we modify the dynamics network to provide environment transitions when using options, allowing searching deeper under the same simulation constraints. Empirical experiments conducted in 26 Atari games demonstrate that OptionZero outperforms MuZero, achieving a 131.58% improvement in mean human-normalized score. Our behavior analysis shows that OptionZero not only learns options but also acquires strategic skills tailored to different game characteristics. Our findings show promising directions for discovering and using options in planning. Our code is available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/optionzero.</p>

<p>Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique to probe the electronic and structural properties of materials. With the rapid growth in both the volume and complexity of XAS datasets driven by advancements in synchrotron radiation facilities, there is an increasing demand for advanced computational tools capable of efficiently analyzing large-scale data. To address these needs, we introduce XASDAML,a flexible, machine learning based framework that integrates the entire data-processing workflow-including dataset construction for spectra and structural descriptors, data filtering, ML modeling, prediction, and model evaluation-into a unified platform. Additionally, it supports comprehensive statistical analysis, leveraging methods such as principal component analysis and clustering to reveal potential patterns and relationships within large datasets. Each module operates independently, allowing users to modify or upgrade modules in response to evolving research needs or technological advances.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunal Singh, Ankan Biswas, Sayandeep Bhowmick, Pradeep Moturi, Siva Kishore Gollapalli</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Step-by-Step Coding (SBSC): a multi-turn math reasoning framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate sequence of programs for solving Olympiad level math problems. At each step/turn, by leveraging the code execution outputs and programs of previous steps, the model generates the next sub-task and the corresponding program to solve it. This way, SBSC, sequentially navigates to reach the final answer. SBSC allows more granular, flexible and precise approach to problem-solving compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of SBSC in tackling competition and Olympiad-level math problems. For Claude-3.5-Sonnet, we observe SBSC (greedy decoding) surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) program generation based reasoning strategies by absolute 10.7% on AMC12, 8% on AIME and 12.6% on MathOdyssey. Given SBSC is multi-turn in nature, we also benchmark SBSC's greedy decoding against self-consistency decoding results of existing SOTA math reasoning strategies and observe performance gain by absolute 6.2% on AMC, 6.7% on AIME and 7.4% on MathOdyssey.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interpretability is crucial to enhance trust in machine learning models for medical diagnostics. However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on neural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to known biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification typically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we delve into the hidden threats posed to text watermarking by users with cross-lingual knowledge. While most research focuses on watermarking methods for English, there is a significant gap in evaluating these methods in cross-lingual contexts. This oversight neglects critical adversary scenarios involving cross-lingual users, creating uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of cross-lingual watermarking. We assess four watermarking techniques across four linguistically rich languages, examining watermark resilience and text quality across various parameters and attacks. Our focus is on a realistic scenario featuring adversaries with cross-lingual expertise, evaluating the adequacy of current watermarking methods against such challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunhai Feng, Jiaming Han, Zhuoran Yang, Xiangyu Yue, Sergey Levine, Jianlan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving complex long-horizon robotic manipulation problems requires sophisticated high-level planning capabilities, the ability to reason about the physical world, and reactively choose appropriate motor skills. Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on Internet data could in principle offer a framework for tackling such problems. However, in their current form, VLMs lack both the nuanced understanding of intricate physics required for robotic manipulation and the ability to reason over long horizons to address error compounding issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time computation framework that enhances VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities for multi-stage manipulation tasks. At its core, our approach iteratively improves a pretrained VLM with a "reflection" mechanism - it uses a generative model to imagine future world states, leverages these predictions to guide action selection, and critically reflects on potential suboptimalities to refine its reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art commercial VLMs as well as other post-training approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dai Quoc Nguyen, Cong Duy Vu Hoang, Duy Vu, Gioacchino Tangari, Thanh Tien Vu, Don Dharmasiri, Yuan-Fang Li, Long Duong</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-weight large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced performance in the Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) task. However, their effectiveness diminishes when dealing with large database schemas, as the context length increases. To address this limitation, we present SQLong, a novel and efficient data augmentation framework designed to enhance LLM performance in long-context scenarios for the NL2SQL task. SQLong generates augmented datasets by extending existing database schemas with additional synthetic CREATE TABLE commands and corresponding data rows, sampled from diverse schemas in the training data. This approach effectively simulates long-context scenarios during finetuning and evaluation. Through experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with SQLong-augmented data significantly outperform those trained on standard datasets. These imply SQLong's practical implementation and its impact on improving NL2SQL capabilities in real-world settings with complex database schemas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Xu, Washim Uddin Mondal, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the first finite-sample analysis for policy evaluation in robust average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Prior works in this setting have established only asymptotic convergence guarantees, leaving open the question of sample complexity. In this work, we address this gap by establishing that the robust Bellman operator is a contraction under the span semi-norm, and developing a stochastic approximation framework with controlled bias. Our approach builds upon Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques to estimate the robust Bellman operator efficiently. To overcome the infinite expected sample complexity inherent in standard MLMC, we introduce a truncation mechanism based on a geometric distribution, ensuring a finite constant sample complexity while maintaining a small bias that decays exponentially with the truncation level. Our method achieves the order-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for robust policy evaluation and robust average reward estimation, marking a significant advancement in robust reinforcement learning theory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruikun Li, Huandong Wang, Qingmin Liao, Yong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy landscapes play a crucial role in shaping dynamics of many real-world complex systems. System evolution is often modeled as particles moving on a landscape under the combined effect of energy-driven drift and noise-induced diffusion, where the energy governs the long-term motion of the particles. Estimating the energy landscape of a system has been a longstanding interdisciplinary challenge, hindered by the high operational costs or the difficulty of obtaining supervisory signals. Therefore, the question of how to infer the energy landscape in the absence of true energy values is critical. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed self-supervised learning method to learn the energy landscape from the evolution trajectories of the system. It first maps the system state from the observation space to a discrete landscape space by an adaptive codebook, and then explicitly integrates energy into the graph neural Fokker-Planck equation, enabling the joint learning of energy estimation and evolution prediction. Experimental results across interdisciplinary systems demonstrate that our estimated energy has a correlation coefficient above 0.9 with the ground truth, and evolution prediction accuracy exceeds the baseline by an average of 17.65\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dilermando Queiroz, Anderson Carlos, Andr\'e Anjos, Lilian Berton</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring equitable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare demands systems that make unbiased decisions across all demographic groups, bridging technical innovation with ethical principles. Foundation Models (FMs), trained on vast datasets through self-supervised learning, enable efficient adaptation across medical imaging tasks while reducing dependency on labeled data. These models demonstrate potential for enhancing fairness, though significant challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across demographic groups. Our review indicates that effective bias mitigation in FMs requires systematic interventions throughout all stages of development. While previous approaches focused primarily on model-level bias mitigation, our analysis reveals that fairness in FMs requires integrated interventions throughout the development pipeline, from data documentation to deployment protocols. This comprehensive framework advances current knowledge by demonstrating how systematic bias mitigation, combined with policy engagement, can effectively address both technical and institutional barriers to equitable AI in healthcare. The development of equitable FMs represents a critical step toward democratizing advanced healthcare technologies, particularly for underserved populations and regions with limited medical infrastructure and computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahsa Golchoubian, Moojan Ghafurian, Nasser Lashgarian Azad, Kerstin Dautenhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p>

In this paper, we study the effects of unsupervised pre-training and transfer learning on the sample complexity of high-dimensional supervised learning. Specifically, we consider the problem of training a single-layer neural network via online stochastic gradient descent. We establish that pre-training and transfer learning (under concept shift) reduce sample complexity by polynomial factors (in the dimension) under very general assumptions. We also uncover some surprising settings where pre-training grants exponential improvement over random initialization in terms of sample complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kartik Nagpal, Dayi Dong, Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, Negar Mehr</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work, spanning from autonomous vehicle coordination to in-space assembly, has shown the importance of learning collaborative behavior for enabling robots to achieve shared goals. A common approach for learning this cooperative behavior is to utilize the centralized-training decentralized-execution paradigm. However, this approach also introduces a new challenge: how do we evaluate the contributions of each agent's actions to the overall success or failure of the team. This credit assignment problem has remained open, and has been extensively studied in the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning literature. In fact, humans manually inspecting agent behavior often generate better credit evaluations than existing methods. We combine this observation with recent works which show Large Language Models demonstrate human-level performance at many pattern recognition tasks. Our key idea is to reformulate credit assignment to the two pattern recognition problems of sequence improvement and attribution, which motivates our novel LLM-MCA method. Our approach utilizes a centralized LLM reward-critic which numerically decomposes the environment reward based on the individualized contribution of each agent in the scenario. We then update the agents' policy networks based on this feedback. We also propose an extension LLM-TACA where our LLM critic performs explicit task assignment by passing an intermediary goal directly to each agent policy in the scenario. Both our methods far outperform the state-of-the-art on a variety of benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging, Robotic Warehouse, and our new Spaceworld benchmark which incorporates collision-related safety constraints. As an artifact of our methods, we generate large trajectory datasets with each timestep annotated with per-agent reward information, as sampled from our LLM critics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yepeng Weng, Dianwen Mei, Huishi Qiu, Xujie Chen, Li Liu, Jiang Tian, Zhongchao Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging a lightweight speculative draft model. However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The weighted low-rank approximation problem is a fundamental numerical linear algebra problem and has many applications in machine learning. Given a $n \times n$ weight matrix $W$ and a $n \times n$ matrix $A$, the goal is to find two low-rank matrices $U, V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ such that the cost of $\| W \circ (U V^\top - A) \|_F^2$ is minimized. Previous work has to pay $\Omega(n^2)$ time when matrices $A$ and $W$ are dense, e.g., having $\Omega(n^2)$ non-zero entries. In this work, we show that there is a certain regime, even if $A$ and $W$ are dense, we can still hope to solve the weighted low-rank approximation problem in almost linear $n^{1+o(1)}$ time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joan Serr\`a, R. Oguz Araz, Dmitry Bogdanov, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting musical versions (different renditions of the same piece) is a challenging task with important applications. Because of the ground truth nature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g., whole song). However, most applications require to match them at the segment level (e.g., 20s chunks). In addition, existing approaches resort to classification and triplet losses, disregarding more recent losses that could bring meaningful improvements. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from weakly annotated segments, together with a contrastive loss variant that outperforms well-studied alternatives. The former is based on pairwise segment distance reductions, while the latter modifies an existing loss following decoupling, hyper-parameter, and geometric considerations. With these two elements, we do not only achieve state-of-the-art results in the standard track-level evaluation, but we also obtain a breakthrough performance in a segment-level evaluation. We believe that, due to the generality of the challenges addressed here, the proposed methods may find utility in domains beyond audio or musical version matching.</p>

<p>Abstract: Smart contracts, closely intertwined with cryptocurrency transactions, have sparked widespread concerns about considerable financial losses of security issues. To counteract this, a variety of tools have been developed to identify vulnerability in smart contract. However, they fail to overcome two challenges at the same time when faced with smart contract bytecode: (i) strong interference caused by enormous non-relevant instructions; (ii) missing semantics of bytecode due to incomplete data and control flow dependencies. In this paper, we propose a multi-teacher based bytecode vulnerability detection method, namely \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{T}eacher \textbf{V}ulnerability \textbf{Hunter} (\textbf{MTVHunter}), which delivers effective denoising and missing semantic to bytecode under multi-teacher guidance. Specifically, we first propose an instruction denoising teacher to eliminate noise interference by abstract vulnerability pattern and further reflect in contract embeddings. Secondly, we design a novel semantic complementary teacher with neuron distillation, which effectively extracts necessary semantic from source code to replenish the bytecode. Particularly, the proposed neuron distillation accelerate this semantic filling by turning the knowledge transition into a regression task. We conduct experiments on 229,178 real-world smart contracts that concerns four types of common vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments show MTVHunter achieves significantly performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangkai Wu, Xuhui Fan, Hongyu Wu, Longbing Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Majorities of distillation methods on pre-trained diffusion models or on pre-trained rectified flow, focus on either the distillation outputs or the trajectories between random noises and clean images to speed up sample generations from pre-trained models. In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We analyse the convergence of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks trained by gradient flow on $n$ data points. Our main contribution leverages the high dimensionality of the ambient space, which implies low correlation of the input samples, to demonstrate that a network with width of order $\log(n)$ neurons suffices for global convergence with high probability. Our analysis uses a Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz viewpoint along the gradient-flow trajectory, which provides an exponential rate of convergence of $\frac{1}{n}$. When the data are exactly orthogonal, we give further refined characterizations of the convergence speed, proving its asymptotic behavior lies between the orders $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, and exhibiting a phase-transition phenomenon in the convergence rate, during which it evolves from the lower bound to the upper, and in a relative time of order $\frac{1}{\log(n)}$.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming materials science, enabling both theoretical advancements and accelerated materials discovery. Recent progress in crystal generation models, which design crystal structures for targeted properties, and foundation atomic models (FAMs), which capture interatomic interactions across the periodic table, has significantly improved inverse materials design. However, an efficient integration of these two approaches remains an open challenge. Here, we present an active learning framework that combines crystal generation models and foundation atomic models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of inverse design. As a case study, we employ Con-CDVAE to generate candidate crystal structures and MACE-MP-0 FAM as one of the high-throughput screeners for bulk modulus evaluation. Through iterative active learning, we demonstrate that Con-CDVAE progressively improves its accuracy in generating crystals with target properties, highlighting the effectiveness of a property-driven fine-tuning process. Our framework is general to accommodate different crystal generation and foundation atomic models, and establishes a scalable approach for AI-driven materials discovery. By bridging generative modeling with atomic-scale simulations, this work paves the way for more accurate and efficient inverse materials design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced deep-learning models designed to understand and generate human language. They work together with models that process data like images, enabling cross-modal understanding. However, existing approaches often suffer from the echo chamber effect, where redundant visual patterns reduce model generalization and accuracy. Thus, the proposed system considered this limitation and developed an enhanced LLM-based framework for cross-modal query understanding using DL-KeyBERT-based CAZSSCL-MPGPT. The collected dataset consists of pre-processed images and texts. The preprocessed images then undergo object segmentation using Easom-You Only Look Once (E-YOLO). The object skeleton is generated, along with the knowledge graph using a Conditional Random Knowledge Graph (CRKG) technique. Further, features are extracted from the knowledge graph, generated skeletons, and segmented objects. The optimal features are then selected using the Fossa Optimization Algorithm (FOA). Meanwhile, the text undergoes word embedding using DL-KeyBERT. Finally, the cross-modal query understanding system utilizes CAZSSCL-MPGPT to generate accurate and contextually relevant image descriptions as text. The proposed CAZSSCL-MPGPT achieved an accuracy of 99.14187362% in the COCO dataset 2017 and 98.43224393% in the vqav2-val dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: Financial bond yield forecasting is challenging due to data scarcity, nonlinear macroeconomic dependencies, and evolving market conditions.

By incorporating 12 key macroeconomic variables, we ensure statistical fidelity by preserving essential market properties. To transform this market dependent synthetic data into actionable insights, we employ a finetuned Large Language Model (LLM) Qwen2.5-7B that generates trading signals (BUY/HOLD/SELL), risk assessments, and volatility projections. We use automated, human and LLM evaluations, all of which demonstrate that our framework improves forecasting performance over existing methods, with statistical validation via predictive accuracy, MAE evaluation(0.103%), profit/loss evaluation (60% profit rate), LLM evaluation (3.37/5) and expert assessments scoring 4.67 out of 5. The reinforcement learning-enhanced synthetic data generation achieves the least Mean Absolute Error of 0.103, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating real-world bond market dynamics. We not only enhance data-driven trading strategies but also provides a scalable, high-fidelity synthetic financial data pipeline for risk & volatility management and investment decision-making. This work establishes a bridge between synthetic data generation, LLM driven financial forecasting, and language model evaluation, contributing to AI-driven financial decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduard Tulchinskii, Anastasia Voznyuk, Laida Kushnareva, Andrei Andriiainen, Irina Piontkovskaya, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to perform multi-step logical reasoning remains an open challenge. Although Chain-of-Thought prompting has improved logical reasoning by enabling models to generate intermediate steps, it lacks mechanisms to assess the coherence of these logical transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight evaluation strategy for logical reasoning that uses query-key alignments inside transformer attention heads. By computing a single forward pass and extracting a "QK-score" from carefully chosen heads, our method reveals latent representations that reliably separate valid from invalid inferences, offering a scalable alternative to traditional ablation-based techniques. We also provide an empirical validation on multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness of our evaluation method against distractors and increased reasoning depth. The experiments were conducted on a diverse set of models, ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Gong, Xiaolin Hu, Huayi Tang, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) abilities. However, existing theoretical analysis of ICL primarily exhibits two limitations: (a) Limited i.i.d. Setting. Most studies focus on supervised function learning tasks where prompts are constructed with i.i.d. input-label pairs. This i.i.d. assumption diverges significantly from real language learning scenarios where prompt tokens are interdependent. (b) Lack of Emergence Explanation. Most literature answers what ICL does from an implicit optimization perspective but falls short in elucidating how ICL emerges and the impact of pre-training phase on ICL. In our paper, to extend (a), we adopt a more practical paradigm, auto-regressive next-token prediction (AR-NTP), which closely aligns with the actual training of language models. Specifically, within AR-NTP, we emphasize prompt token-dependency, which involves predicting each subsequent token based on the preceding sequence. To address (b), we formalize a systematic pre-training and ICL framework, highlighting the layer-wise structure of sequences and topics, alongside a two-level expectation. In conclusion, we present data-dependent, topic-dependent and optimization-dependent PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for pre-trained LLMs, investigating that ICL emerges from the generalization of sequences and topics. Our theory is supported by experiments on numerical linear dynamic systems, synthetic GINC and real-world language datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirtan Padh, Zhufeng Li, Cecilia Casolo, Niki Kilbertus</p>
<p>Abstract: Assuming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents prior knowledge of causal relationships between variables is a common starting point for cause-effect estimation. Existing literature typically invokes hypothetical domain expert knowledge or causal discovery algorithms to justify this assumption. In practice, neither may propose a single DAG with high confidence. Domain experts are hesitant to rule out dependencies with certainty or have ongoing disputes about relationships; causal discovery often relies on untestable assumptions itself or only provides an equivalence class of DAGs and is commonly sensitive to hyperparameter and threshold choices. We propose an efficient, gradient-based optimization method that provides bounds for causal queries over a collection of causal graphs -- compatible with imperfect prior knowledge -- that may still be too large for exhaustive enumeration. Our bounds achieve good coverage and sharpness for causal queries such as average treatment effects in linear and non-linear synthetic settings as well as on real-world data. Our approach aims at providing an easy-to-use and widely applicable rebuttal to the valid critique of `What if your assumed DAG is wrong?'.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Zhang, Liangxiu Han, Stephen White, Saad Hassan, Philip A Kalra, James Ritchie, Carl Diver, Jennie Shorley</p>
<p>Abstract: Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI), remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional cardiovascular risk scores rely primarily on clinical data, often overlooking environmental influences like air pollution that significantly impact heart health. Moreover, integrating complex time-series environmental data with clinical records is challenging.
  We introduce TabulaTime, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances ACS risk prediction by combining clinical risk factors with air pollution data. TabulaTime features three key innovations: First, it integrates time-series air pollution data with clinical tabular data to improve prediction accuracy. Second, its PatchRWKV module automatically extracts complex temporal patterns, overcoming limitations of traditional feature engineering while maintaining linear computational complexity. Third, attention mechanisms enhance interpretability by revealing interactions between clinical and environmental factors.
  Experimental results show that TabulaTime improves prediction accuracy by over 20% compared to conventional models such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with air pollution data alone contributing over a 10% improvement. Feature importance analysis identifies critical predictors including previous angina, systolic blood pressure, PM10, and NO2. Overall, TabulaTime bridges clinical and environmental insights, supporting personalized prevention strategies and informing public health policies to mitigate ACS risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jorge Marco-Blanco, Rub\'en Cuevas</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series classification is essential across diverse domains, including medical diagnosis, industrial monitoring, financial forecasting, and human activity recognition. The Rocket algorithm has emerged as a simple yet powerful method, achieving state-of-the-art performance through random convolutional kernels applied to time-series data, followed by non-linear transformation. Its architecture approximates a one-hidden-layer convolutional neural network while eliminating parameter training, ensuring computational efficiency. Despite its empirical success, fundamental questions about its theoretical foundations remain unexplored. We bridge theory and practice by formalizing Rocket's random convolutional filters within the compressed sensing framework, proving that random projections preserve discriminative patterns in time-series data. This analysis reveals relationships between kernel parameters and input signal characteristics, enabling more principled approaches to algorithm configuration. Moreover, we demonstrate that its non-linearity, based on the proportion of positive values after convolutions, expresses the inherent sparsity of time-series data. Our theoretical investigation also proves that Rocket satisfies two critical conditions: translation invariance and noise robustness. These findings enhance interpretability and provide guidance for parameter optimization in extreme cases, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical application of time-series classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Fayad, Max Zimmer, Martin Schwartz, Philippe Ciais, Fabian Gieseke, Gabriel Belouze, Sarah Brood, Aurelien De Truchis, Alexandre d'Aspremont</p>
<p>Abstract: Significant efforts have been directed towards adapting self-supervised multimodal learning for Earth observation applications. However, existing methods produce coarse patch-sized embeddings, limiting their effectiveness and integration with other modalities like LiDAR. To close this gap, we present DUNIA, an approach to learn pixel-sized embeddings through cross-modal alignment between images and full-waveform LiDAR data. As the model is trained in a contrastive manner, the embeddings can be directly leveraged in the context of a variety of environmental monitoring tasks in a zero-shot setting. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings for seven such tasks (canopy height mapping, fractional canopy cover, land cover mapping, tree species identification, plant area index, crop type classification, and per-pixel waveform-based vertical structure mapping). The results show that the embeddings, along with zero-shot classifiers, often outperform specialized supervised models, even in low data regimes. In the fine-tuning setting, we show strong low-shot capabilities with performances near or better than state-of-the-art on five out of six tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chun Jung Chen, Chung-Chin Shih, Ti-Rong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Strength estimation and adjustment are crucial in designing human-AI interactions, particularly in games where AI surpasses human players. This paper introduces a novel strength system, including a strength estimator (SE) and an SE-based Monte Carlo tree search, denoted as SE-MCTS, which predicts strengths from games and offers different playing strengths with human styles. The strength estimator calculates strength scores and predicts ranks from games without direct human interaction. SE-MCTS utilizes the strength scores in a Monte Carlo tree search to adjust playing strength and style. We first conduct experiments in Go, a challenging board game with a wide range of ranks. Our strength estimator significantly achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting ranks by observing 15 games only, whereas the previous method reached 49% accuracy for 100 games. For strength adjustment, SE-MCTS successfully adjusts to designated ranks while achieving a 51.33% accuracy in aligning to human actions, outperforming a previous state-of-the-art, with only 42.56% accuracy. To demonstrate the generality of our strength system, we further apply SE and SE-MCTS to chess and obtain consistent results. These results show a promising approach to strength estimation and adjustment, enhancing human-AI interactions in games.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mahdi Abedi, David Pardo, Tariq Alkhalifah</p>
<p>Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained increasing attention for solving partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz equation, due to their flexibility and mesh-free formulation. However, their low-frequency bias limits their accuracy and convergence speed for high-frequency wavefield simulations. To alleviate these problems, we propose a simplified PINN framework that incorporates Gabor functions, designed to capture the oscillatory and localized nature of wavefields more effectively. Unlike previous attempts that rely on auxiliary networks to learn Gabor parameters, we redefine the network's task to map input coordinates to a custom Gabor coordinate system, simplifying the training process without increasing the number of trainable parameters compared to a simple PINN. We validate the proposed method across multiple velocity models, including the complex Marmousi and Overthrust models, and demonstrate its superior accuracy, faster convergence, and better robustness features compared to both traditional PINNs and earlier Gabor-based PINNs. Additionally, we propose an efficient integration of a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) to enhance wavefield behavior near the boundaries. These results suggest that our approach offers an efficient and accurate alternative for scattered wavefield modeling and lays the groundwork for future improvements in PINN-based seismic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mila Andreani</p>
<p>Abstract: The aim of this thesis is to extend the applications of the Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm to handle mixed-frequency and longitudinal data. To this end, standard statistical approaches have been exploited to build two novel algorithms: the Mixed- Frequency Quantile Regression Forest (MIDAS-QRF) and the Finite Mixture Quantile Regression Forest (FM-QRF). The MIDAS-QRF combines the flexibility of QRF with the Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) approach, enabling non-parametric quantile estimation with variables observed at different frequencies. FM-QRF, on the other hand, extends random effects machine learning algorithms to a QR framework, allowing for conditional quantile estimation in a longitudinal data setting. The contributions of this dissertation lie both methodologically and empirically. Methodologically, the MIDAS-QRF and the FM-QRF represent two novel approaches for handling mixed-frequency and longitudinal data in QR machine learning framework. Empirically, the application of the proposed models in financial risk management and climate-change impact evaluation demonstrates their validity as accurate and flexible models to be applied in complex empirical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Bertazzi, Tim Johnston, Gareth O. Roberts, Alain Durmus</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper aims to provide differential privacy (DP) guarantees for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In a first part, we establish DP guarantees on samples output by MCMC algorithms as well as Monte Carlo estimators associated with these methods under assumptions on the convergence properties of the underlying Markov chain. In particular, our results highlight the critical condition of ensuring the target distribution is differentially private itself. In a second part, we specialise our analysis to the unadjusted Langevin algorithm and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and establish guarantees on their (R\'enyi) DP. To this end, we develop a novel methodology based on Girsanov's theorem combined with a perturbation trick to obtain bounds for an unbounded domain and in a non-convex setting. We establish: (i) uniform in $n$ privacy guarantees when the state of the chain after $n$ iterations is released, (ii) bounds on the privacy of the entire chain trajectory. These findings provide concrete guidelines for privacy-preserving MCMC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuli Wu, Fucheng Liu, R\"uveyda Yilmaz, Henning Konermann, Peter Walter, Johannes Stegmaier</p>
<p>Abstract: Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), computed with an ImageNet pretrained Inception-v3 network, is widely used as a state-of-the-art evaluation metric for generative models. It assumes that feature vectors from Inception-v3 follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and calculates the 2-Wasserstein distance based on their means and covariances. While FID effectively measures how closely synthetic data match real data in many image synthesis tasks, the primary goal in biomedical generative models is often to enrich training datasets ideally with corresponding annotations. For this purpose, the gold standard for evaluating generative models is to incorporate synthetic data into downstream task training, such as classification and segmentation, to pragmatically assess its performance. In this paper, we examine cases from retinal imaging modalities, including color fundus photography and optical coherence tomography, where FID and its related metrics misalign with task-specific evaluation goals in classification and segmentation. We highlight the limitations of using various metrics, represented by FID and its variants, as evaluation criteria for these applications and address their potential caveats in broader biomedical imaging modalities and downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raymond Zhang, Hedi Hadiji, Richard Combes</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider linear stochastic bandits where the set of actions is an ellipsoid. We provide the first known minimax optimal algorithm for this problem. We first derive a novel information-theoretic lower bound on the regret of any algorithm, which must be at least $\Omega(\min(d \sigma \sqrt{T} + d \|\theta\|_{A}, \|\theta\|_{A} T))$ where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ the time horizon, $\sigma^2$ the noise variance, $A$ a matrix defining the set of actions and $\theta$ the vector of unknown parameters. We then provide an algorithm whose regret matches this bound to a multiplicative universal constant. The algorithm is non-classical in the sense that it is not optimistic, and it is not a sampling algorithm. The main idea is to combine a novel sequential procedure to estimate $\|\theta\|$, followed by an explore-and-commit strategy informed by this estimate. The algorithm is highly computationally efficient, and a run requires only time $O(dT + d^2 \log(T/d) + d^3)$ and memory $O(d^2)$, in contrast with known optimistic algorithms, which are not implementable in polynomial time. We go beyond minimax optimality and show that our algorithm is locally asymptotically minimax optimal, a much stronger notion of optimality. We further provide numerical experiments to illustrate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Eichhorn, Veronika Spieker, Kerstin Hammernik, Elisa Saks, Lina Felsner, Kilian Weiss, Christine Preibisch, Julia A. Schnabel</p>
<p>Abstract: Purpose: T2* quantification from gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging is particularly affected by subject motion due to the high sensitivity to magnetic field inhomogeneities, which are influenced by motion and might cause signal loss. Thus, motion correction is crucial to obtain high-quality T2* maps.
  Methods: We extend our previously introduced learning-based physics-informed motion correction method, PHIMO, by utilizing acquisition knowledge to enhance the reconstruction performance for challenging motion patterns and increase PHIMO's robustness to varying strengths of magnetic field inhomogeneities across the brain. We perform comprehensive evaluations regarding motion detection accuracy and image quality for data with simulated and real motion.
  Results: Our extended version of PHIMO outperforms the learning-based baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to line detection and image quality. Moreover, PHIMO performs on-par with a conventional state-of-the-art motion correction method for T2* quantification from gradient echo MRI, which relies on redundant data acquisition.
  Conclusion: PHIMO's competitive motion correction performance, combined with a reduction in acquisition time by over 40% compared to the state-of-the-art method, make it a promising solution for motion-robust T2* quantification in research settings and clinical routine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxuan Zhang, Ruqi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks but struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their generated responses. This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on LLaMA Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods.

<p>Abstract: Humans possess delicate dynamic balance mechanisms that enable them to maintain stability across diverse terrains and under extreme conditions. However, despite significant advances recently, existing locomotion algorithms for humanoid robots are still struggle to traverse extreme environments, especially in cases that lack external perception (e.g., vision or LiDAR). This is because current methods often rely on gait-based or perception-condition rewards, lacking effective mechanisms to handle unobservable obstacles and sudden balance loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel whole-body locomotion algorithm based on dynamic balance and Reinforcement Learning (RL) that enables humanoid robots to traverse extreme terrains, particularly narrow pathways and unexpected obstacles, using only proprioception. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic balance mechanism by leveraging an extended measure of Zero-Moment Point (ZMP)-driven rewards and task-driven rewards in a whole-body actor-critic framework, aiming to achieve coordinated actions of the upper and lower limbs for robust locomotion. Experiments conducted on a full-sized Unitree H1-2 robot verify the ability of our method to maintain balance on extremely narrow terrains and under external disturbances, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the robot's adaptability to complex environments.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the tidiness score-guided Monte Carlo tree search (TSMCTS), a novel framework designed to address the tabletop tidying up problem using only an RGB-D camera. We address two major problems for tabletop tidying up problem: (1) the lack of public datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the difficulty of specifying the goal configuration of unseen objects. We address the former by presenting the tabletop tidying up (TTU) dataset, a structured dataset collected in simulation. Using this dataset, we train a vision-based discriminator capable of predicting the tidiness score. This discriminator can consistently evaluate the degree of tidiness across unseen configurations, including real-world scenes. Addressing the second problem, we employ Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to find tidying trajectories without specifying explicit goals. Instead of providing specific goals, we demonstrate that our MCTS-based planner can find diverse tidied configurations using the tidiness score as a guidance. Consequently, we propose TSMCTS, which integrates a tidiness discriminator with an MCTS-based tidying planner to find optimal tidied arrangements. TSMCTS has successfully demonstrated its capability across various environments, including coffee tables, dining tables, office desks, and bathrooms.

<p>Abstract: Gait refers to the patterns of limb movement generated during walking, which are unique to each individual due to both physical and behavioural traits. Walking patterns have been widely studied in biometrics, biomechanics, sports, and rehabilitation. While traditional methods rely on video and motion capture, advances in underfoot pressure sensing technology now offer deeper insights into gait. However, underfoot pressures during walking remain underexplored due to the lack of large, publicly accessible datasets. To address this, the UNB StepUP database was created, featuring gait pressure data collected with high-resolution pressure sensing tiles (4 sensors/cm\textsuperscript{2}, 1.2m by 3.6m). Its first release, UNB StepUP-P150, includes over 200,000 footsteps from 150 individuals across various walking speeds (preferred, slow-to-stop, fast, and slow) and footwear types (barefoot, standard shoes, and two personal shoes).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanmeng Wang, Wenkai Ji, Jian Zhou, Fu Xiao, Tsung-Hui Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed learning paradigm for training deep neural networks (DNNs) at the wireless edge, but its performance can be severely hindered by unreliable wireless transmission and inherent data heterogeneity among clients. Existing solutions primarily address these challenges by incorporating wireless resource optimization strategies, often focusing on uplink resource allocation across clients under the assumption of homogeneous client-server network standards. However, these approaches overlooked the fact that mobile clients may connect to the server via diverse network standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi) with customized configurations, limiting the flexibility of server-side modifications and restricting applicability in real-world commercial networks. This paper presents a novel theoretical analysis about how transmission failures in unreliable networks distort the effective label distributions of local samples, causing deviations from the global data distribution and introducing convergence bias in FL. Our analysis reveals that a carefully designed client selection strategy can mitigate biases induced by network unreliability and data heterogeneity. Motivated by this insight, we propose FedCote, a client selection approach that optimizes client selection probabilities without relying on wireless resource scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of FedCote in DNN-based classification tasks under unreliable networks with frequent transmission failures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyin Xu, Kaiyuan Chen, Xiao Li, Ke Shen, Chenggang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs). Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With theoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process. Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Kai Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like instruction-following abilities, particularly those exceeding 100 billion parameters. The combined capability of some smaller, resource-friendly LLMs can address most of the instructions that larger LLMs excel at. In this work, we explore how to route the best-performing LLM for each instruction to achieve better overall performance. We develop a new paradigm, constructing capability instructions with model capability representation, user instruction, and performance inquiry prompts to assess the performance. To learn from capability instructions, we introduce a new end-to-end framework called Model Selection with Aptitude Test (Model-SAT), which generates positive and negative samples based on what different models perform well or struggle with. Model-SAT uses a model capability encoder that extends its model representation to a lightweight LLM. Our experiments show that Model-SAT understands the performance dimensions of candidate models and provides the probabilities of their capability to handle various instructions. Additionally, during deployment, a new model can quickly infer its aptitude test results across 50 tasks, each with 20 shots. Model-SAT performs state-of-the-art model routing without candidate inference and in real-world new model-released scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoran Li, Chunming Hu, Junfan Chen, Zhijun Chen, Richong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Word order difference between source and target languages is a major obstacle to cross-lingual transfer, especially in the dependency parsing task. Current works are mostly based on order-agnostic models or word reordering to mitigate this problem. However, such methods either do not leverage grammatical information naturally contained in word order or are computationally expensive as the permutation space grows exponentially with the sentence length. Moreover, the reordered source sentence with an unnatural word order may be a form of noising that harms the model learning. To this end, we propose an Implicit Word Reordering framework with Knowledge Distillation (IWR-KD). This framework is inspired by that deep networks are good at learning feature linearization corresponding to meaningful data transformation, e.g. word reordering. To realize this idea, we introduce a knowledge distillation framework composed of a word-reordering teacher model and a dependency parsing student model. We verify our proposed method on Universal Dependency Treebanks across 31 different languages and show it outperforms a series of competitors, together with experimental analysis to illustrate how our method works towards training a robust parser.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifeng Zhuang, Diyuan Shi, Runze Suo, Xiao He, Hongyin Zhang, Ting Wang, Shangke Lyu, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex high-dimensional spaces with high Degree-of-Freedom and complicated action spaces, such as humanoid robots equipped with dexterous hands, pose significant challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which need to wisely balance exploration and exploitation under limited sample budgets. In general, feasible regions for accomplishing tasks within complex high-dimensional spaces are exceedingly narrow. For instance, in the context of humanoid robot motion control, the vast majority of space corresponds to falling, while only a minuscule fraction corresponds to standing upright, which is conducive to the completion of downstream tasks. Once the robot explores into a potentially task-relevant region, it should place greater emphasis on the data within that region. Building on this insight, we propose the $\textbf{S}$elf-$\textbf{I}$mitative $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{SIRL}$) framework, where the RL algorithm also imitates potentially task-relevant trajectories. Specifically, trajectory return is utilized to determine its relevance to the task and an additional behavior cloning is adopted whose weight is dynamically adjusted based on the trajectory return. As a result, our proposed algorithm achieves 120% performance improvement on the challenging HumanoidBench with 5% extra computation overhead. With further visualization, we find the significant performance gain does lead to meaningful behavior improvement that several tasks are solved successfully.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Van Waerebeke, Marco Lorenzi, Giovanni Neglia, Kevin Scaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims at removing the influence of specific data points from a trained model, striving to achieve this at a fraction of the cost of full model retraining. In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of unlearning methods and establish the first upper and lower bounds on minimax computation times for this problem, characterizing the performance of the most efficient algorithm against the most difficult objective function. Specifically, for strongly convex objective functions and under the assumption that the forget data is inaccessible to the unlearning method, we provide a phase diagram for the unlearning complexity ratio -- a novel metric that compares the computational cost of the best unlearning method to full model retraining. The phase diagram reveals three distinct regimes: one where unlearning at a reduced cost is infeasible, another where unlearning is trivial because adding noise suffices, and a third where unlearning achieves significant computational advantages over retraining. These findings highlight the critical role of factors such as data dimensionality, the number of samples to forget, and privacy constraints in determining the practical feasibility of unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yen-Ju Lu, Ting-Yao Hu, Hema Swetha Koppula, Hadi Pouransari, Jen-Hao Rick Chang, Yin Xia, Xiang Kong, Qi Zhu, Simon Wang, Oncel Tuzel, Raviteja Vemulapalli</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose Mutual Reinforcing Data Synthesis (MRDS) within LLMs to improve few-shot dialogue summarization task. Unlike prior methods that require external knowledge, we mutually reinforce the LLM\'s dialogue synthesis and summarization capabilities, allowing them to complement each other during training and enhance overall performances. The dialogue synthesis capability is enhanced by directed preference optimization with preference scoring from summarization capability. The summarization capability is enhanced by the additional high quality dialogue-summary paired data produced by the dialogue synthesis capability. By leveraging the proposed MRDS mechanism, we elicit the internal knowledge of LLM in the format of synthetic data, and use it to augment the few-shot real training dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that our method improves dialogue summarization, achieving a 1.5% increase in ROUGE scores and a 0.3% improvement in BERT scores in few-shot settings. Furthermore, our method attains the highest average scores in human evaluations, surpassing both the pre-trained models and the baselines fine-tuned solely for summarization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Battistello, Guido Bertoni, Michele Corrias, Lorenzo Nava, Davide Rusconi, Matteo Zoia, Fabio Pierazzi, Andrea Lanzi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for performing side-channel attacks on elliptic curve cryptography. Unlike previous approaches and inspired by the ``activity detection'' literature, we adopt a long-short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to analyze a power trace and identify patterns of operation in the scalar multiplication algorithm performed during an ECDSA signature, that allows us to recover bits of the ephemeral key, and thus retrieve the signer's private key. Our approach is based on the fact that modular reductions are conditionally performed by micro-ecc and depend on key bits.
  We evaluated the feasibility and reproducibility of our attack through experiments in both simulated and real implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack by implementing it on a real target device, an STM32F415 with the micro-ecc library, and successfully compromise it. Furthermore, we show that current countermeasures, specifically the coordinate randomization technique, are not sufficient to protect against side channels. Finally, we suggest other approaches that may be implemented to thwart our attack.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minyeong Hwang, Ziseok Lee, Gwangsoo Kim, Kyungsu Kim, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead optimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into diverse drug candidates. Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids serve as an important theoretical framework for understanding molecular interactions. Binary LJ fluids, where two distinct species of particles interact based on the LJ potential, exhibit rich phase behavior and provide valuable insights of complex fluid mixtures. Here we report the construction and utility of an artificial intelligence (AI) model for binary LJ fluids, focusing on their effectiveness in predicting radial distribution functions (RDFs) across a range of conditions. The RDFs of a binary mixture with varying compositions and temperatures are collected from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish and validate the AI model. In this AI pipeline, RDFs are discretized in order to reduce the output dimension of the model. This, in turn, improves the efficacy, and reduce the complexity of an AI RDF model. The model is shown to predict RDFs for many unknown mixtures very accurately, especially outside the training temperature range. Our analysis suggests that the particle size ratio has a higher order impact on the microstructure of a binary mixture. We also highlight the areas where the fidelity of the AI model is low when encountering new regimes with different underlying physics.</p>

<p>Abstract: How can we verify whether copyrighted content was used to train a large vision-language model (VLM) without direct access to its training data? Motivated by the hypothesis that a VLM is able to recognize images from its training corpus, we propose DIS-CO, a novel approach to infer the inclusion of copyrighted content during the model's development. By repeatedly querying a VLM with specific frames from targeted copyrighted material, DIS-CO extracts the content's identity through free-form text completions. To assess its effectiveness, we introduce MovieTection, a benchmark comprising 14,000 frames paired with detailed captions, drawn from films released both before and after a model's training cutoff. Our results show that DIS-CO significantly improves detection performance, nearly doubling the average AUC of the best prior method on models with logits available. Our findings also highlight a broader concern: all tested models appear to have been exposed to some extent to copyrighted content.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stella Dumen\v{c}i\'c, Luka Lan\v{c}a, Karlo Jakac, Stefan Ivi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) missions require reliable search methods to locate survivors, especially in challenging or inaccessible environments. This is why introducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be of great help to enhance the efficiency of SAR missions while simultaneously increasing the safety of everyone involved in the mission. Motivated by this, we design and experiment with autonomous UAV search for humans in a Mediterranean karst environment. The UAVs are directed using Heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) ergodic control method according to known probability density and detection function. The implemented sensing framework consists of a probabilistic search model, motion control system, and computer vision object detection. It enables calculation of the probability of the target being detected in the SAR mission, and this paper focuses on experimental validation of proposed probabilistic framework and UAV control. The uniform probability density to ensure the even probability of finding the targets in the desired search area is achieved by assigning suitably thought-out tasks to 78 volunteers. The detection model is based on YOLO and trained with a previously collected ortho-photo image database. The experimental search is carefully planned and conducted, while as many parameters as possible are recorded. The thorough analysis consists of the motion control system, object detection, and the search validation. The assessment of the detection and search performance provides strong indication that the designed detection model in the UAV control algorithm is aligned with real-world results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Helis Bernardo, Daniel Alencar da Costa, Filipe Roseiro Cogo, S\'ergio Queir\'oz de Medeiros, Uir\'a Kulesza</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) is a cornerstone of modern software development. However, while widely adopted in traditional software projects, applying CI practices to Machine Learning (ML) projects presents distinctive characteristics. For example, our previous work revealed that ML projects often experience longer build durations and lower test coverage rates compared to their non-ML counterparts. Building on these quantitative findings, this study surveys 155 practitioners from 47 ML projects to investigate the underlying reasons for these distinctive characteristics through a qualitative perspective. Practitioners highlighted eight key differences, including test complexity, infrastructure requirements, and build duration and stability. Common challenges mentioned by practitioners include higher project complexity, model training demands, extensive data handling, increased computational resource needs, and dependency management, all contributing to extended build durations. Furthermore, ML systems' non-deterministic nature, data dependencies, and computational constraints were identified as significant barriers to effective testing. The key takeaway from this study is that while foundational CI principles remain valuable, ML projects require tailored approaches to address their unique challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose a set of ML-specific CI practices, including tracking model performance metrics and prioritizing test execution within CI pipelines. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to strengthen the testing culture in ML projects. By bridging quantitative findings with practitioners' insights, this study provides a deeper understanding of the interplay between CI practices and the unique demands of ML projects, laying the groundwork for more efficient and robust CI strategies in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyoun Kim, Jacob Springer, Aditi Raghunathan, Maarten Sap</p>
<p>Abstract: In retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, each individual component -- the LLM, embedder, and corpus -- could introduce biases in the form of skews towards outputting certain perspectives or identities. In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity in 6 different LLMs. Through comprehensive fine-tuning experiments creating 120 differently biased embedders, we demonstrate how to control bias while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system. Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to the embedder bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than increasing its fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoeri Poels, Cristina Venturini, Alessandro Pau, Olivier Sauter, Vlado Menkovski, the TCV team, the WPTE team</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximizing fusion performance in tokamaks relies on high energy confinement, often achieved through distinct operating regimes. The automated labeling of these confinement states is crucial to enable large-scale analyses or for real-time control applications. While this task becomes difficult to automate near state transitions or in marginal scenarios, much success has been achieved with data-driven models. However, these methods generally provide predictions as point estimates, and cannot adequately deal with missing and/or broken input signals. To enable wide-range applicability, we develop methods for confinement state classification with uncertainty quantification and model robustness. We focus on off-line analysis for TCV discharges, distinguishing L-mode, H-mode, and an in-between dithering phase (D). We propose ensembling data-driven methods on two axes: model formulations and feature sets. The former considers a dynamic formulation based on a recurrent Fourier Neural Operator-architecture and a static formulation based on gradient-boosted decision trees. These models are trained using multiple feature groupings categorized by diagnostic system or physical quantity. A dataset of 302 TCV discharges is fully labeled, and will be publicly released. We evaluate our method quantitatively using Cohen's kappa coefficient for predictive performance and the Expected Calibration Error for the uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we discuss performance using a variety of common and alternative scenarios, the performance of individual components, out-of-distribution performance, cases of broken or missing signals, and evaluate conditionally-averaged behavior around different state transitions. Overall, the proposed method can distinguish L, D and H-mode with high performance, can cope with missing or broken signals, and provides meaningful uncertainty estimates.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider layerwise function-space learning rates, which measure the magnitude of the change in a neural network's output function in response to an update to a parameter tensor. This contrasts with traditional learning rates, which describe the magnitude of changes in parameter space. We develop efficient methods to measure and set function-space learning rates in arbitrary neural networks, requiring only minimal computational overhead through a few additional backward passes that can be performed at the start of, or periodically during, training. We demonstrate two key applications: (1) analysing the dynamics of standard neural network optimisers in function space, rather than parameter space, and (2) introducing FLeRM (Function-space Learning Rate Matching), a novel approach to hyperparameter transfer across model scales. FLeRM records function-space learning rates while training a small, cheap base model, then automatically adjusts parameter-space layerwise learning rates when training larger models to maintain consistent function-space updates. FLeRM gives hyperparameter transfer across model width, depth, initialisation scale, and LoRA rank in various architectures including MLPs with residual connections and transformers with different layer normalisation schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikunj Saunshi, Nishanth Dikkala, Zhiyuan Li, Sanjiv Kumar, Sashank J. Reddi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have shown remarkable reasoning abilities and scaling laws suggest that large parameter count, especially along the depth axis, is the primary driver. In this work, we make a stronger claim -- many reasoning problems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This unlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show that for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction, and math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the performance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than a $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing that many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and thus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth. Perhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of language modeling -- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with $k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a $kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior that depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT reasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and can simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we also present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and design a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a promising technique to mitigate the high inference latency of autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its promise, the effective application of speculative decoding in LLMs still confronts three key challenges: the increasing memory demands of the draft model, the distribution shift between the short-training corpora and long-context inference, and inefficiencies in attention implementation. In this work, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context settings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce novel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation from short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an innovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for prefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively resolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach achieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including repository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Betley, Daniel Tan, Niels Warncke, Anna Sztyber-Betley, Xuchan Bao, Mart\'in Soto, Nathan Labenz, Owain Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.
  Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.
  In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.
  It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runpeng Yu, Xinyin Ma, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: To utilize visual information, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) relies on the perception process of its vision encoder. The completeness and accuracy of visual perception significantly influence the precision of spatial reasoning, fine-grained understanding, and other tasks. However, MLLM still lacks the autonomous capability to control its own visual perception processes, for example, selectively reviewing specific regions of an image or focusing on information related to specific object categories. In this work, we propose the concept of Visual Perception Token, aiming to empower MLLM with a mechanism to control its visual perception processes. We design two types of Visual Perception Tokens, termed the Region Selection Token and the Vision Re-Encoding Token. MLLMs autonomously generate these tokens, just as they generate text, and use them to trigger additional visual perception actions. The Region Selection Token explicitly identifies specific regions in an image that require further perception, while the Vision Re-Encoding Token uses its hidden states as control signals to guide additional visual perception processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of these tokens in handling spatial reasoning, improving fine-grained understanding, and other tasks. On average, the introduction of Visual Perception Tokens improves the performance of a 2B model by 23.6\%, increasing its score from 0.572 to 0.708, and even outperforms a 7B parameter model by 13.4\% (from 0.624).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgy Noarov, Riccardo Fogliato, Martin Bertran, Aaron Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the design of adaptive, sequential experiments for unbiased average treatment effect (ATE) estimation in the design-based potential outcomes setting. Our goal is to develop adaptive designs offering sublinear Neyman regret, meaning their efficiency must approach that of the hindsight-optimal nonadaptive design. Recent work [Dai et al, 2023] introduced ClipOGD, the first method achieving $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ expected Neyman regret under mild conditions. In this work, we propose adaptive designs with substantially stronger Neyman regret guarantees. In particular, we modify ClipOGD to obtain anytime $\widetilde{O}(\log T)$ Neyman regret under natural boundedness assumptions. Further, in the setting where experimental units have pre-treatment covariates, we introduce and study a class of contextual "multigroup" Neyman regret guarantees: Given any set of possibly overlapping groups based on the covariates, the adaptive design outperforms each group's best non-adaptive designs. In particular, we develop a contextual adaptive design with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ anytime multigroup Neyman regret. We empirically validate the proposed designs through an array of experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Jingzhou Liu, Yulong Li, Kenneth Shaw, Tony Tao, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Deepak Pathak</p>
<p>Abstract: Many contact-rich tasks humans perform, such as box pickup or rolling dough, rely on force feedback for reliable execution. However, this force information, which is readily available in most robot arms, is not commonly used in teleoperation and policy learning. Consequently, robot behavior is often limited to quasi-static kinematic tasks that do not require intricate force-feedback. In this paper, we first present a low-cost, intuitive, bilateral teleoperation setup that relays external forces of the follower arm back to the teacher arm, facilitating data collection for complex, contact-rich tasks. We then introduce FACTR, a policy learning method that employs a curriculum which corrupts the visual input with decreasing intensity throughout training. The curriculum prevents our transformer-based policy from over-fitting to the visual input and guides the policy to properly attend to the force modality. We demonstrate that by fully utilizing the force information, our method significantly improves generalization to unseen objects by 43\% compared to baseline approaches without a curriculum.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tizian Wenzel, Gabriele Santin, Bernard Haasdonk</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we leverage a recent deep kernel representer theorem to connect kernel based learning and (deep) neural networks in order to understand their interplay. In particular, we show that the use of special types of kernels yields models reminiscent of neural networks that are founded in the same theoretical framework of classical kernel methods, while benefiting from the computational advantages of deep neural networks. Especially the introduced Structured Deep Kernel Networks (SDKNs) can be viewed as neural networks (NNs) with optimizable activation functions obeying a representer theorem. This link allows us to analyze also NNs within the framework of kernel networks. We prove analytic properties of the SDKNs which show their universal approximation properties in three different asymptotic regimes of unbounded number of centers, width and depth. Especially in the case of unbounded depth, more accurate constructions can be achieved using fewer layers compared to corresponding constructions for ReLU neural networks. This is made possible by leveraging properties of kernel approximation.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible. Unsupervised cross-domain Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training shows great potential for challenging continuous visual control but poses a big challenge. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{R}andom \textbf{P}re-\textbf{T}raining with \textbf{pro}totypes (CRPTpro), a novel, efficient, and effective self-supervised cross-domain RL pre-training framework. CRPTpro decouples data sampling from encoder pre-training, proposing decoupled random collection to easily and quickly generate a qualified cross-domain pre-training dataset. Moreover, a novel prototypical self-supervised algorithm is proposed to pre-train an effective visual encoder that is generic across different domains. Without finetuning, the cross-domain encoder can be implemented for challenging downstream tasks defined in different domains, either seen or unseen. Compared with recent advanced methods, CRPTpro achieves better performance on downstream policy learning without extra training on exploration agents for data collection, greatly reducing the burden of pre-training. We conduct extensive experiments across eight challenging continuous visual-control domains, including balance control, robot locomotion, and manipulation. CRPTpro significantly outperforms the next best Proto-RL(C) on 11/12 cross-domain downstream tasks with only 54.5\% wall-clock pre-training time,\footnote{Implementation: https://github.com/liuxin0824/CRPTpro} exhibiting state-of-the-art pre-training performance with greatly improved pre-training efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Jin, Guangsi Shi, Yuan-Fang Li, Bo Xiong, Tian Zhou, Flora D. Salim, Liang Zhao, Lingfei Wu, Qingsong Wen, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting has remained a focal point due to its vital applications in sectors such as energy management and transportation planning. Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph Gegenbauer Convolution (TGGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency. Our findings pave the way for devising a broader array of provably expressive GNN-based models for time series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Bonchi, Claudio Gentile, Francesco Paolo Nerini, Andr\'e Panisson, Fabio Vitale</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GERN, a novel scalable framework for training GNNs in node classification tasks, based on effective resistance, a standard tool in spectral graph theory. Our method progressively refines the GNN weights on a sequence of random spanning trees suitably transformed into path graphs which, despite their simplicity, are shown to retain essential topological and node information of the original input graph. The sparse nature of these path graphs substantially lightens the computational burden of GNN training. This not only enhances scalability but also improves accuracy in subsequent test phases, especially under small training set regimes, which are of great practical importance, as in many real-world scenarios labels may be hard to obtain. In these settings, our framework yields very good results as it effectively counters the training deterioration caused by overfitting when the training set is small. Our method also addresses common issues like over-squashing and over-smoothing while avoiding under-reaching phenomena.
  Although our framework is flexible and can be deployed in several types of GNNs, in this paper we focus on graph convolutional networks and carry out an extensive experimental investigation on a number of real-world graph benchmarks, where we achieve simultaneous improvement of training speed and test accuracy over a wide pool of representative baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning has gained popularity for distributed learning without aggregating sensitive data from clients. But meanwhile, the distributed and isolated nature of data isolation may be complicated by data quality, making it more vulnerable to noisy labels. Many efforts exist to defend against the negative impacts of noisy labels in centralized or federated settings. However, there is a lack of a benchmark that comprehensively considers the impact of noisy labels in a wide variety of typical FL settings. In this work, we serve the first standardized benchmark that can help researchers fully explore potential federated noisy settings. Also, we conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the characteristics of these data settings and the comparison across baselines, which may guide method development in the future. We highlight the 20 basic settings for 6 datasets proposed in our benchmark and standardized simulation pipeline for federated noisy label learning, including implementations of 9 baselines. We hope this benchmark can facilitate idea verification in federated learning with noisy labels. \texttt{FedNoisy} is available at \codeword{https://github.com/SMILELab-FL/FedNoisy}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanjiang Cao, Quan Z. Sheng, Julian McAuley, Lina Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Generative AI has been a long-standing essential topic in the machine learning community, which can impact a number of application areas like text generation and computer vision. The major paradigm to train a generative model is maximum likelihood estimation, which pushes the learner to capture and approximate the target data distribution by decreasing the divergence between the model distribution and the target distribution. This formulation successfully establishes the objective of generative tasks, while it is incapable of satisfying all the requirements that a user might expect from a generative model. Reinforcement learning, serving as a competitive option to inject new training signals by creating new objectives that exploit novel signals, has demonstrated its power and flexibility to incorporate human inductive bias from multiple angles, such as adversarial learning, hand-designed rules and learned reward model to build a performant model. Thereby, reinforcement learning has become a trending research field and has stretched the limits of generative AI in both model design and application. It is reasonable to summarize and conclude advances in recent years with a comprehensive review. Although there are surveys in different application areas recently, this survey aims to shed light on a high-level review that spans a range of application areas. We provide a rigorous taxonomy in this area and make sufficient coverage on various models and applications. Notably, we also surveyed the fast-developing large language model area. We conclude this survey by showing the potential directions that might tackle the limit of current models and expand the frontiers for generative AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible. Unsupervised skill discovery seeks to acquire different useful skills without extrinsic reward via unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL), with the discovered skills efficiently adapting to multiple downstream tasks in various ways. However, recent advanced skill discovery methods struggle to well balance state exploration and skill diversity, particularly when the potential skills are rich and hard to discern. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive dyna\textbf{m}ic \textbf{S}kill \textbf{D}iscovery \textbf{(ComSD)}\footnote{Code and videos: https://github.com/liuxin0824/ComSD} which generates diverse and exploratory unsupervised skills through a novel intrinsic incentive, named contrastive dynamic reward. It contains a particle-based exploration reward to make agents access far-reaching states for exploratory skill acquisition, and a novel contrastive diversity reward to promote the discriminability between different skills. Moreover, a novel dynamic weighting mechanism between the above two rewards is proposed to balance state exploration and skill diversity, which further enhances the quality of the discovered skills. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that ComSD can generate diverse behaviors at different exploratory levels for multi-joint robots, enabling state-of-the-art adaptation performance on challenging downstream tasks. It can also discover distinguishable and far-reaching exploration skills in the challenging tree-like 2D maze.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Li, Juan Guevara, Xinhong Xie, Quanyan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the distribution shift between the offline dataset and the online environment. In multi-agent RL (MARL), this distribution shift may arise from the nonstationary opponents in the online testing who display distinct behaviors from those recorded in the offline dataset. Hence, the key to the broader deployment of offline MARL is the online adaptation to nonstationary opponents. Recent advances in foundation models, e.g., large language models, have demonstrated the generalization ability of the transformer, an emerging neural network architecture, in sequence modeling, of which offline RL is a special case. One naturally wonders \textit{whether offline-trained transformer-based RL policies adapt to nonstationary opponents online}. We propose a novel auto-regressive training to equip transformer agents with online adaptability based on the idea of self-augmented pre-conditioning. The transformer agent first learns offline to predict the opponent's action based on past observations. When deployed online, such a fictitious opponent play, referred to as the belief, is fed back to the transformer, together with other environmental feedback, to generate future actions conditional on the belief. Motivated by self-confirming equilibrium in game theory, the training loss consists of belief consistency loss, requiring the beliefs to match the opponent's actual actions and best response loss, mandating the agent to behave optimally under the belief. We evaluate the online adaptability of the proposed self-confirming transformer (SCT) in a structured environment, iterated prisoner's dilemma games, to demonstrate SCT's belief consistency and equilibrium behaviors as well as more involved multi-particle environments to showcase its superior performance against nonstationary opponents over prior transformers and offline MARL baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interpretability plays a critical role in the application of statistical learning for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) for complex diseases. In this study, we leverage a rule-based workflow, namely causal rule learning (CRL) to estimate and enhance our understanding of HTE for atrial septal defect, addressing an overlooked question in previous literature: what if an individual simultaneously belongs to multiple groups with different average treatment effects? The CRL process consists of three steps: rule discovery, which generates a set of causal rules with corresponding subgroup average treatment effects; rule selection, which identifies a subset of these rules to deconstruct individual-level treatment effects as a linear combination of subgroup-level effects; and rule analysis, which outlines a detailed procedure for further analyzing each selected rule from multiple perspectives to identify the most promising rules for validation. Extensive simulation studies and real-world data analysis demonstrate that CRL outperforms other methods in providing interpretable estimates of HTE, especially when dealing with complex ground truth and sufficient sample sizes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifei Zhang, Hao Zhu, Menglin Yang, Jiahong Liu, Rex Ying, Irwin King, Piotr Koniusz</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning generalizable self-supervised graph representations for downstream tasks is challenging. To this end, Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as a leading approach. The embeddings of CL are arranged on a hypersphere where similarity is measured by the cosine distance. However, many real-world graphs, especially of hierarchical nature, cannot be embedded well in the Euclidean space. Although the hyperbolic embedding is suitable for hierarchical representation learning, naively applying CL to the hyperbolic space may result in the so-called dimension collapse, i.e., features will concentrate mostly within few density regions, leading to poor utilization of the whole feature space. Thus, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to learn high-quality graph embeddings in hyperbolic space. Specifically, we design the alignment metric that effectively captures the hierarchical data-invariant information, as well as we propose a substitute of the uniformity metric to prevent the so-called dimensional collapse. We show that in the hyperbolic space one has to address the leaf- and height-level uniformity related to properties of trees. In the ambient space of the hyperbolic manifold these notions translate into imposing an isotropic ring density towards boundaries of Poincar\'e ball. Our experiments support the efficacy of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuval Dagan, Constantinos Daskalakis, Maxwell Fishelson, Noah Golowich</p>
<p>Abstract: We provide a novel reduction from swap-regret minimization to external-regret minimization, which improves upon the classical reductions of Blum-Mansour [BM07] and Stolz-Lugosi [SL05] in that it does not require finiteness of the space of actions. We show that, whenever there exists a no-external-regret algorithm for some hypothesis class, there must also exist a no-swap-regret algorithm for that same class. For the problem of learning with expert advice, our result implies that it is possible to guarantee that the swap regret is bounded by {\epsilon} after $\log(N)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ rounds and with $O(N)$ per iteration complexity, where $N$ is the number of experts, while the classical reductions of Blum-Mansour and Stolz-Lugosi require $O(N/\epsilon^2)$ rounds and at least $\Omega(N^2)$ per iteration complexity. Our result comes with an associated lower bound, which -- in contrast to that in [BM07] -- holds for oblivious and $\ell_1$-constrained adversaries and learners that can employ distributions over experts, showing that the number of rounds must be $\tilde\Omega(N/\epsilon^2)$ or exponential in $1/\epsilon$.
  Our reduction implies that, if no-regret learning is possible in some game, then this game must have approximate correlated equilibria, of arbitrarily good approximation. This strengthens the folklore implication of no-regret learning that approximate coarse correlated equilibria exist. Importantly, it provides a sufficient condition for the existence of correlated equilibrium which vastly extends the requirement that the action set is finite, thus answering a question left open by [DG22; Ass+23]. Moreover, it answers several outstanding questions about equilibrium computation and learning in games.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyuan Luo, Juntong Ni, Shengyu Chen, Runlong Yu, Yiqun Xie, Licheng Liu, Zhenong Jin, Huaxiu Yao, Xiaowei Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling environmental ecosystems is critical for the sustainability of our planet, but is extremely challenging due to the complex underlying processes driven by interactions amongst a large number of physical variables. As many variables are difficult to measure at large scales, existing works often utilize a combination of observable features and locally available measurements or modeled values as input to build models for a specific study region and time period. This raises a fundamental question in advancing the modeling of environmental ecosystems: how to build a general framework for modeling the complex relationships amongst various environmental data over space and time? In this paper, we introduce a framework, FREE, which maps available environmental data into a text space and then converts the traditional predictive modeling task in environmental science to a semantic recognition problem. The proposed framework leverages recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to supplement the original input features with natural language descriptions. This framework facilitates capturing the data semantics and allows harnessing the irregularities of input features. When used for long-term prediction, FREE has the flexibility to incorporate newly collected observations to enhance future prediction. The efficacy of FREE is evaluated in the context of two societally important real-world applications, predicting stream water temperature in the Delaware River Basin and predicting annual corn yield in Illinois and Iowa. Beyond the superior predictive performance over multiple baselines, FREE is shown to be more data- and computation-efficient as it can be pre-trained on simulated data generated by physics-based models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He Wang, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: In large-scale federated and decentralized learning, communication efficiency is one of the most challenging bottlenecks. While gossip communication -- where agents can exchange information with their connected neighbors -- is more cost-effective than communicating with the remote server, it often requires a greater number of communication rounds, especially for large and sparse networks. To tackle the trade-off, we examine the communication efficiency under a semi-decentralized communication protocol, in which agents can perform both agent-to-agent and agent-to-server communication in a probabilistic manner. We design a tailored communication-efficient algorithm over semi-decentralized networks, referred to as PISCO, which inherits the robustness to data heterogeneity thanks to gradient tracking and allows multiple local updates for saving communication. We establish the convergence rate of PISCO for nonconvex problems and show that PISCO enjoys a linear speedup in terms of the number of agents and local updates. Our numerical results highlight the superior communication efficiency of PISCO and its resilience to data heterogeneity and various network topologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus Mueller, Kathrin Gruber, Dennis Fok</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based generative models, commonly referred to as diffusion models, have proven to be successful at generating text and image data. However, their adaptation to mixed-type tabular data remains underexplored. In this work, we propose CDTD, a Continuous Diffusion model for mixed-type Tabular Data. CDTD is based on a novel combination of score matching and score interpolation to enforce a unified continuous noise distribution for both continuous and categorical features. We explicitly acknowledge the necessity of homogenizing distinct data types by relying on model-specific loss calibration and initialization schemes.To further address the high heterogeneity in mixed-type tabular data, we introduce adaptive feature- or type-specific noise schedules. These ensure balanced generative performance across features and optimize the allocation of model capacity across features and diffusion time. Our experimental results show that CDTD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models, captures feature correlations exceptionally well, and that heterogeneity in the noise schedule design boosts sample quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avinandan Bose, Mihaela Curmei, Daniel L. Jiang, Jamie Morgenstern, Sarah Dean, Lillian J. Ratliff, Maryam Fazel</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates ML systems serving a group of users, with multiple models/services, each aimed at specializing to a sub-group of users. We consider settings where upon deploying a set of services, users choose the one minimizing their personal losses and the learner iteratively learns by interacting with diverse users. Prior research shows that the outcomes of learning dynamics, which comprise both the services' adjustments and users' service selections, hinge significantly on the initialization. However, finding good initializations faces two main challenges: (i) Bandit feedback: Typically, data on user preferences are not available before deploying services and observing user behavior; (ii) Suboptimal local solutions: The total loss landscape (i.e., the sum of loss functions across all users and services) is not convex and gradient-based algorithms can get stuck in poor local minima.
  We address these challenges with a randomized algorithm to adaptively select a minimal set of users for data collection in order to initialize a set of services. Under mild assumptions on the loss functions, we prove that our initialization leads to a total loss within a factor of the globally optimal total loss with complete user preference data}, and this factor scales logarithmically in the number of services. This result is a generalization of the well-known $k$-means++ guarantee to a broad problem class, which is also of independent interest. The theory is complemented by experiments on real as well as semi-synthetic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangkang Lu, Yanhua Yu, Hao Fei, Xuan Li, Zixuan Yang, Zirui Guo, Meiyu Liang, Mengran Yin, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, spectral graph neural networks, characterized by polynomial filters, have garnered increasing attention and have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as node classification. These models typically assume that eigenvalues for the normalized Laplacian matrix are distinct from each other, thus expecting a polynomial filter to have a high fitting ability. However, this paper empirically observes that normalized Laplacian matrices frequently possess repeated eigenvalues. Moreover, we theoretically establish that the number of distinguishable eigenvalues plays a pivotal role in determining the expressive power of spectral graph neural networks. In light of this observation, we propose an eigenvalue correction strategy that can free polynomial filters from the constraints of repeated eigenvalue inputs. Concretely, the proposed eigenvalue correction strategy enhances the uniform distribution of eigenvalues, thus mitigating repeated eigenvalues, and improving the fitting capacity and expressive power of polynomial filters. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code is available at: https://github.com/Lukangkang123/EC-GNN</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Burak Var{\i}c{\i}, Emre Acart\"urk, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Abhishek Kumar, Ali Tajer</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses intervention-based causal representation learning (CRL) under a general nonparametric latent causal model and an unknown transformation that maps the latent variables to the observed variables. Linear and general transformations are investigated. The paper addresses both the identifiability and achievability aspects. Identifiability refers to determining algorithm-agnostic conditions that ensure recovering the true latent causal variables and the latent causal graph underlying them. Achievability refers to the algorithmic aspects and addresses designing algorithms that achieve identifiability guarantees. By drawing novel connections between score functions (i.e., the gradients of the logarithm of density functions) and CRL, this paper designs a score-based class of algorithms that ensures both identifiability and achievability. First, the paper focuses on linear transformations and shows that one stochastic hard intervention per node suffices to guarantee identifiability. It also provides partial identifiability guarantees for soft interventions, including identifiability up to mixing with parents for general causal models and perfect latent graph recovery for sufficiently non-linear causal models. Secondly, it focuses on general transformations and shows that two stochastic hard interventions per node suffice for identifiability. This is achieved by defining a differentiable loss function whose global optima ensures identifiability for general CRL. Notably, one does not need to know which pair of interventional environments have the same node intervened. Finally, the theoretical results are empirically validated via experiments on structured synthetic data and image data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitris Bertsimas, Arthur Delarue, Jean Pauphilet</p>
<p>Abstract: When training predictive models on data with missing entries, the most widely used and versatile approach is a pipeline technique where we first impute missing entries and then compute predictions. In this paper, we view prediction with missing data as a two-stage adaptive optimization problem and propose a new class of models, adaptive linear regression models, where the regression coefficients adapt to the set of observed features. We show that some adaptive linear regression models are equivalent to learning an imputation rule and a downstream linear regression model simultaneously instead of sequentially. We leverage this joint-impute-then-regress interpretation to generalize our framework to non-linear models. In settings where data is strongly not missing at random, our methods achieve a 2-10% improvement in out-of-sample accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juliusz Ziomek, Masaki Adachi, Michael A. Osborne</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimisation requires fitting a Gaussian process model, which in turn requires specifying prior on the unknown black-box function -- most of the theoretical literature assumes this prior is known. However, it is common to have more than one possible prior for a given black-box function, for example suggested by domain experts with differing opinions. In some cases, the type-II maximum likelihood estimator for selecting prior enjoys the consistency guarantee, but it does not universally apply to all types of priors. If the problem is stationary, one could rely on the Regret Balancing scheme to conduct the optimisation, but in the case of time-varying problems, such a scheme cannot be used. To address this gap in existing research, we propose a novel algorithm, PE-GP-UCB, which is capable of solving time-varying Bayesian optimisation problems even without the exact knowledge of the function's prior. The algorithm relies on the fact that either the observed function values are consistent with some of the priors, in which case it is easy to reject the wrong priors, or the observations are consistent with all candidate priors, in which case it does not matter which prior our model relies on. We provide a regret bound on the proposed algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm on toy and real-world time-varying problems and show that it outperforms the maximum likelihood estimator, fully Bayesian treatment of unknown prior and Regret Balancing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanran Chen, Yinpeng Dong, Shitong Shao, Zhongkai Hao, Xiao Yang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative learning, recognized for its effective modeling of data distributions, offers inherent advantages in handling out-of-distribution instances, especially for enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks. Among these, diffusion classifiers, utilizing powerful diffusion models, have demonstrated superior empirical robustness. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their robustness is still lacking, raising concerns about their vulnerability to stronger future attacks. In this study, we prove that diffusion classifiers possess $O(1)$ Lipschitzness, and establish their certified robustness, demonstrating their inherent resilience. To achieve non-constant Lipschitzness, thereby obtaining much tighter certified robustness, we generalize diffusion classifiers to classify Gaussian-corrupted data. This involves deriving the evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) for these distributions, approximating the likelihood using the ELBO, and calculating classification probabilities via Bayes' theorem. Experimental results show the superior certified robustness of these Noised Diffusion Classifiers (NDCs). Notably, we achieve over 80% and 70% certified robustness on CIFAR-10 under adversarial perturbations with \(\ell_2\) norms less than 0.25 and 0.5, respectively, using a single off-the-shelf diffusion model without any additional data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Real-world analog systems intrinsically suffer from noise that can impede model convergence and accuracy on a variety of deep learning models. We demonstrate that differentiable activations like GELU and SiLU enable robust propagation of gradients which help to mitigate analog quantization error that is ubiquitous to all analog systems. We perform analysis and training of convolutional, linear, and transformer networks in the presence of quantized noise. Here, we are able to demonstrate that continuously differentiable activation functions are significantly more noise resilient over conventional rectified activations. As in the case of ReLU, the error in gradients are 100x higher than those in GELU near zero. Our findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate activations to realize performant and reliable hardware implementations across several machine learning domains such as computer vision, signal processing, and beyond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Jiao, Xiangzhe Kong, Li Zhang, Ziyang Yu, Fangyuan Ren, Wenjuan Tan, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining on a large number of unlabeled 3D molecules has showcased superiority in various scientific applications. However, prior efforts typically focus on pretraining models in a specific domain, either proteins or small molecules, missing the opportunity to leverage cross-domain knowledge. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Equivariant Pretrained Transformer (EPT), an all-atom foundation model that can be pretrained from multiple domain 3D molecules. Built upon an E(3)-equivariant transformer, EPT is able to not only process atom-level information but also incorporate block-level features (e.g. residuals in proteins). Additionally, we employ a block-level denoising task, rather than the conventional atom-level denoising, as the pretraining objective. To pretrain EPT, we construct a large-scale dataset of 5.89M entries, comprising small molecules, proteins, protein-protein complexes, and protein-molecule complexes. Experimental evaluations on downstream tasks including ligand binding affinity prediction, protein property prediction, and molecular property prediction, show that EPT significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in the first task and achieves competitively superior performance for the remaining two tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of EPT in identifying small molecule drug candidates targeting 3CL protease, a critical target in the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Among 1,978 FDA-approved drugs, EPT ranks 7 out of 8 known anti-COVID-19 drugs in the top 200, indicating the high recall of EPT. By using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, EPT further discoveries 7 novel compounds whose binding affinities are higher than that of the top-ranked known anti-COVID-19 drug, showcasing its powerful capabilities in drug discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujun Zhou, Yufei Han, Haomin Zhuang, Kehan Guo, Zhenwen Liang, Hongyan Bao, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse applications. However, concerns regarding their security, particularly the vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, persist. Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static datasets, ICAG employs an iterative process to enhance both the defense and attack agents. This continuous improvement process strengthens defenses against newly generated jailbreak prompts. Our empirical studies affirm ICAG's efficacy, where LLMs safeguarded by ICAG exhibit significantly reduced jailbreak success rates across various attack scenarios. Moreover, ICAG demonstrates remarkable transferability to other LLMs, indicating its potential as a versatile defense mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiashuo Jiang, Yinyu Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the reinforcement learning problem for the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which plays a central role in satisfying safety or resource constraints in sequential learning and decision-making. In this problem, we are given finite resources and a MDP with unknown transition probabilities. At each stage, we take an action, collecting a reward and consuming some resources, all assumed to be unknown and need to be learned over time. In this work, we take the first step towards deriving optimal problem-dependent guarantees for the CMDP problems. We derive a logarithmic regret bound, which translates into a $O(\frac{1}{\Delta\cdot\epsilon}\cdot\log^2(1/\epsilon))$ sample complexity bound, with $\Delta$ being a problem-dependent parameter, yet independent of $\epsilon$. Our sample complexity bound improves upon the state-of-art $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for CMDP problems established in the previous literature, in terms of the dependency on $\epsilon$. To achieve this advance, we develop a new framework for analyzing CMDP problems. To be specific, our algorithm operates in the primal space and we resolve the primal LP for the CMDP problem at each period in an online manner, with adaptive remaining resource capacities. The key elements of our algorithm are: i) a characterization of the instance hardness via LP basis, ii) an eliminating procedure that identifies one optimal basis of the primal LP, and; iii) a resolving procedure that is adaptive to the remaining resources and sticks to the characterized optimal basis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Geometric graphs are a special kind of graph with geometric features, which are vital to model many scientific problems. Unlike generic graphs, geometric graphs often exhibit physical symmetries of translations, rotations, and reflections, making them ineffectively processed by current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address this issue, researchers proposed a variety of geometric GNNs equipped with invariant/equivariant properties to better characterize the geometry and topology of geometric graphs. Given the current progress in this field, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive survey of data structures, models, and applications related to geometric GNNs. In this paper, based on the necessary but concise mathematical preliminaries, we formalize geometric graph as the data structure, on top of which we provide a unified view of existing models from the geometric message passing perspective. Additionally, we summarize the applications as well as the related datasets to facilitate later research for methodology development and experimental evaluation. We also discuss the challenges and future potential directions of geometric GNNs at the end of this survey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yasushi Esaki, Satoshi Koide, Takuro Kutsuna</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain incremental learning (DIL) has been discussed in previous studies on deep neural network models for classification. In DIL, we assume that samples on new domains are observed over time. The models must classify inputs on all domains. In practice, however, we may encounter a situation where we need to perform DIL under the constraint that the samples on the new domain are observed only infrequently. Therefore, in this study, we consider the extreme case where we have only one sample from the new domain, which we call one-shot DIL. We first empirically show that existing DIL methods do not work well in one-shot DIL. We have analyzed the reason for this failure through various investigations. According to our analysis, we clarify that the difficulty of one-shot DIL is caused by the statistics in the batch normalization layers. Therefore, we propose a technique regarding these statistics and demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through experiments on open datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sabyasachi Sahoo, Mostafa ElAraby, Jonas Ngnawe, Yann Pequignot, Frederic Precioso, Christian Gagne</p>
<p>Abstract: Test Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses the problem of distribution shift by adapting a pretrained model to a new domain during inference. When faced with challenging shifts, most methods collapse and perform worse than the original pretrained model. In this paper, we find that not all layers are equally receptive to the adaptation, and the layers with the most misaligned gradients often cause performance degradation. To address this, we propose GALA, a novel layer selection criterion to identify the most beneficial updates to perform during test time adaptation. This criterion can also filter out unreliable samples with noisy gradients. Its simplicity allows seamless integration with existing TTA loss functions, thereby preventing degradation and focusing adaptation on the most trainable layers. This approach also helps to regularize adaptation to preserve the pretrained features, which are crucial for handling unseen domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed layer selection framework improves the performance of existing TTA approaches across multiple datasets, domain shifts, model architectures, and TTA losses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transit agencies world-wide face tightening budgets and declining ridership. To maintain quality of service while cutting costs, efficient transit network design is essential. But planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. The most successful approaches to date use metaheuristic algorithms to search through the space of possible transit networks by applying low-level heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these low-level heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper we use deep reinforcement learning with graph neural nets to learn low-level heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm, instead of designing them manually. These learned heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and achieve new state-of-the-art results the challenging Mumford benchmark. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by as much as 52% and 25% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 19% over the city's existing transit network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cornelius Emde, Francesco Pinto, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Since neural classifiers are known to be sensitive to adversarial perturbations that alter their accuracy, \textit{certification methods} have been developed to provide provable guarantees on the insensitivity of their predictions to such perturbations. Furthermore, in safety-critical applications, the frequentist interpretation of the confidence of a classifier (also known as model calibration) can be of utmost importance. This property can be measured via the Brier score or the expected calibration error. We show that attacks can significantly harm calibration, and thus propose certified calibration as worst-case bounds on calibration under adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we produce analytic bounds for the Brier score and approximate bounds via the solution of a mixed-integer program on the expected calibration error. Finally, we propose novel calibration attacks and demonstrate how they can improve model calibration through \textit{adversarial calibration training}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Guande He, Jianfei Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) are a powerful variant of diffusion models for interpolating between two arbitrary paired distributions given as endpoints. Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we take the first step in fast sampling of DDBMs without extra training, motivated by the well-established recipes in diffusion models. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same marginal distributions and training objectives, give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic, and result in diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs). DBIMs are not only up to 25$\times$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs but also induce a novel, simple, and insightful form of ordinary differential equation (ODE) which inspires high-order numerical solvers. Moreover, DBIMs maintain the generation diversity in a distinguished way, by using a booting noise in the initial sampling step, which enables faithful encoding, reconstruction, and semantic interpolation in image translation tasks.

<p>Abstract: In many sequential decision problems, an agent performs a repeated task. He then suffers regret and obtains information that he may use in the following rounds. However, sometimes the agent may also obtain information and avoid suffering regret by querying external sources. We study the trade-off between the information an agent accumulates and the regret it suffers. We invoke information-theoretic methods for obtaining regret lower bounds, that also allow us to easily re-derive several known lower bounds. We introduce the first Bayesian regret lower bounds that depend on the information an agent accumulates. We also prove regret upper bounds using the amount of information the agent accumulates. These bounds show that information measured in bits, can be traded off for regret, measured in reward. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these bounds in improving the performance of a question-answering task with large language models, allowing us to obtain valuable insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thom Badings, Wietze Koops, Sebastian Junges, Nils Jansen</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the verification of neural network policies for discrete-time stochastic systems with respect to reach-avoid specifications. We use a learner-verifier procedure that learns a certificate for the specification, represented as a neural network. Verifying that this neural network certificate is a so-called reach-avoid supermartingale (RASM) proves the satisfaction of a reach-avoid specification. Existing approaches for such a verification task rely on computed Lipschitz constants of neural networks. These approaches struggle with large Lipschitz constants, especially for reach-avoid specifications with high threshold probabilities. We present two key contributions to obtain smaller Lipschitz constants than existing approaches. First, we introduce logarithmic RASMs (logRASMs), which take exponentially smaller values than RASMs and hence have lower theoretical Lipschitz constants. Second, we present a fast method to compute tighter upper bounds on Lipschitz constants based on weighted norms. Our empirical evaluation shows we can consistently verify the satisfaction of reach-avoid specifications with probabilities as high as 99.9999%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran He, Can Chang, Huazhe Xu, Ling Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), a new family of probabilistic samplers, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to generate diverse sets of high-reward candidates, in contrast to standard return maximization approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning) which often converge to a single optimal solution. Recent works have focused on developing goal-conditioned GFlowNets, which aim to train a single GFlowNet capable of achieving different outcomes as the task specifies. However, training such models is challenging due to extremely sparse rewards, particularly in high-dimensional problems. Moreover, previous methods suffer from the limited coverage of explored trajectories during training, which presents more pronounced challenges when only offline data is available. In this work, we propose a novel method called \textbf{R}etrospective \textbf{B}ackward \textbf{S}ynthesis (\textbf{RBS}) to address these critical problems. Specifically, RBS synthesizes new backward trajectories in goal-conditioned GFlowNets to enrich training trajectories with enhanced quality and diversity, thereby introducing copious learnable signals for effectively tackling the sparse reward problem. Extensive empirical results show that our method improves sample efficiency by a large margin and outperforms strong baselines on various standard evaluation benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madison Cooley, Shandian Zhe, Robert M. Kirby, Varun Shankar</p>
<p>Abstract: We present polynomial-augmented neural networks (PANNs), a novel machine learning architecture that combines deep neural networks (DNNs) with a polynomial approximant. PANNs combine the strengths of DNNs (flexibility and efficiency in higher-dimensional approximation) with those of polynomial approximation (rapid convergence rates for smooth functions). To aid in both stable training and enhanced accuracy over a variety of problems, we present (1) a family of orthogonality constraints that impose mutual orthogonality between the polynomial and the DNN within a PANN; (2) a simple basis pruning approach to combat the curse of dimensionality introduced by the polynomial component; and (3) an adaptation of a polynomial preconditioning strategy to both DNNs and polynomials. We test the resulting architecture for its polynomial reproduction properties, ability to approximate both smooth functions and functions of limited smoothness, and as a method for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Through these experiments, we demonstrate that PANNs offer superior approximation properties to DNNs for both regression and the numerical solution of PDEs, while also offering enhanced accuracy over both polynomial and DNN-based regression (each) when regressing functions with limited smoothness.</p>

We propose a new transformation that transforms lazy online learning algorithms into private algorithms. We apply our transformation for differentially private OPE and OCO using existing lazy algorithms for these problems. Our final algorithms obtain regret, which significantly improves the regret in the high privacy regime $\varepsilon \ll 1$, obtaining $\sqrt{T \log d} + T^{1/3} \log(d)/\varepsilon^{2/3}$ for DP-OPE and $\sqrt{T} + T^{1/3} \sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{2/3}$ for DP-OCO. We also complement our results with a lower bound for DP-OPE, showing that these rates are optimal for a natural family of low-switching private algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muthu Chidambaram, Rong Ge</p>
<p>Abstract: A machine learning model is calibrated if its predicted probability for an outcome matches the observed frequency for that outcome conditional on the model prediction. This property has become increasingly important as the impact of machine learning models has continued to spread to various domains. As a result, there are now a dizzying number of recent papers on measuring and improving the calibration of (specifically deep learning) models. In this work, we reassess the reporting of calibration metrics in the recent literature. We show that there exist trivial recalibration approaches that can appear seemingly state-of-the-art unless calibration and prediction metrics (i.e. test accuracy) are accompanied by additional generalization metrics such as negative log-likelihood. We then use a calibration-based decomposition of Bregman divergences to develop a new extension to reliability diagrams that jointly visualizes calibration and generalization error, and show how our visualization can be used to detect trade-offs between calibration and generalization. Along the way, we prove novel results regarding the relationship between full calibration error and confidence calibration error for Bregman divergences. We also establish the consistency of the kernel regression estimator for calibration error used in our visualization approach, which generalizes existing consistency results in the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinbin Zhang, Nasib Ullah, Rohit Babbar</p>
<p>Abstract: Extreme Multi-label Text Classification (XMC) entails selecting the most relevant labels for an instance from a vast label set. Extreme Zero-shot XMC (EZ-XMC) extends this challenge by operating without annotated data, relying only on raw text instances and a predefined label set, making it particularly critical for addressing cold-start problems in large-scale recommendation and categorization systems. State-of-the-art methods, such as MACLR and RTS, leverage lightweight bi-encoders but rely on suboptimal pseudo labels for training, such as document titles (MACLR) or document segments (RTS), which may not align well with the intended tagging or categorization tasks. On the other hand, LLM-based approaches, like ICXML, achieve better label-instance alignment but are computationally expensive and impractical for real-world EZ-XMC applications due to their heavy inference costs. In this paper, we introduce LMTX (Large language Model as Teacher for eXtreme classification), a novel framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. LMTX utilizes an LLM to identify high-quality pseudo labels during training, while employing a lightweight bi-encoder for efficient inference. This design eliminates the need for LLMs at inference time, offering the benefits of improved label alignment without sacrificing computational efficiency. Our approach achieves superior performance and efficiency over both LLM and non-LLM based approaches, establishing a new state-of-the-art in EZ-XMC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Ronen, Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun, Richard Baraniuk, Randall Balestriero, Bin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop Latent Exploration Score (LES) to mitigate over-exploration in Latent Space Optimization (LSO), a popular method for solving black-box discrete optimization problems. LSO utilizes continuous optimization within the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and is known to be susceptible to over-exploration, which manifests in unrealistic solutions that reduce its practicality. LES leverages the trained decoder's approximation of the data distribution, and can be employed with any VAE decoder - including pretrained ones - without additional training, architectural changes or access to the training data. Our evaluation across five LSO benchmark tasks and twenty-two VAE models demonstrates that LES always enhances the quality of the solutions while maintaining high objective values, leading to improvements over existing solutions in most cases. We believe that new avenues to LSO will be opened by LES' ability to identify out of distribution areas, differentiability, and computational tractability. Open source code for LES is available at https://github.com/OmerRonen/les.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yang, Chenchen Yuan, Yao Rong, Felix Steinbauer, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: A multitude of industries depend on accurate and reasonable tabular data augmentation for their business processes. Contemporary methodologies in generating tabular data revolve around utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLM). However, GAN-based approaches are documented to produce samples with common-sense errors attributed to the absence of external knowledge. On the other hand, LLM-based methods exhibit a limited capacity to capture the disparities between synthesized and actual data distribution due to the absence of feedback from a discriminator during training. Furthermore, the decoding of LLM-based generation introduces gradient breakpoints, impeding the backpropagation of loss from a discriminator, thereby complicating the integration of these two approaches. To solve this challenge, we propose using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to apply GANs, guiding LLMs to enhance the probability distribution of tabular features. This approach enables the utilization of LLMs as generators for GANs in synthesizing tabular data. Our experiments demonstrate that PPO leads to an approximately 4\% improvement in the accuracy of models trained on synthetically generated data over state-of-the-art across three real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maayan Ehrenberg, Roy Ganz, Nir Rosenfeld</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial training aims to defend against *adversaries*: malicious opponents whose sole aim is to harm predictive performance in any way possible - a rather harsh perspective, which we assert results in unnecessarily conservative models. Instead, we propose to model opponents as simply pursuing their own goals, rather than working directly against the classifier. Employing tools from strategic modeling, our approach uses knowledge or beliefs regarding the opponent's possible incentives as inductive bias for learning. Our method of *strategic training* is designed to defend against opponents within an *incentive uncertainty set*: this resorts to adversarial learning when the set is maximal, but offers potential gains when it can be appropriately reduced. We conduct a series of experiments that show how even mild knowledge regarding the adversary's incentives can be useful, and that the degree of potential gains depends on how incentives relate to the structure of the learning task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Constantinos Daskalakis, Noah Golowich</p>
<p>Abstract: The empirical risk minimization (ERM) principle has been highly impactful in machine learning, leading both to near-optimal theoretical guarantees for ERM-based learning algorithms as well as driving many of the recent empirical successes in deep learning. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether the ability to perform ERM, which computes a hypothesis minimizing empirical risk on a given dataset, is necessary for efficient learning: in particular, is there a weaker oracle than ERM which can nevertheless enable learnability? We answer this question affirmatively, showing that in the realizable setting of PAC learning for binary classification, a concept class can be learned using an oracle which only returns a single bit indicating whether a given dataset is realizable by some concept in the class. The sample complexity and oracle complexity of our algorithm depend polynomially on the VC dimension of the hypothesis class, thus showing that there is only a polynomial price to pay for use of our weaker oracle. Our results extend to the agnostic learning setting with a slight strengthening of the oracle, as well as to the partial concept, multiclass and real-valued learning settings. In the setting of partial concept classes, prior to our work no oracle-efficient algorithms were known, even with a standard ERM oracle. Thus, our results address a question of Alon et al. (2021) who asked whether there are algorithmic principles which enable efficient learnability in this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yulai Zhao, Masatoshi Uehara, Gabriele Scalia, Sunyuan Kung, Tommaso Biancalani, Sergey Levine, Ehsan Hajiramezanali</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful generative models that allow for precise control over the characteristics of the generated samples. While these diffusion models trained on large datasets have achieved success, there is often a need to introduce additional controls in downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add such controls using an offline dataset comprising inputs and labels. We formulate this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward functions. Our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning), produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method enables sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing methods. Compared to classifier-free guidance, it improves sample efficiency and can greatly simplify dataset construction by leveraging conditional independence between the inputs and additional controls. Additionally, unlike classifier guidance, it eliminates the need to train classifiers from intermediate states to additional controls. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaoyl18/CTRL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Valdeira, Jo\~ao Xavier, Cl\'audia Soares, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication overhead is a known bottleneck in federated learning (FL). To address this, lossy compression is commonly used on the information communicated between the server and clients during training. In horizontal FL, where each client holds a subset of the samples, such communication-compressed training methods have recently seen significant progress. However, in their vertical FL counterparts, where each client holds a subset of the features, our understanding remains limited. To address this, we propose an error feedback compressed vertical federated learning (EF-VFL) method to train split neural networks. In contrast to previous communication-compressed methods for vertical FL, EF-VFL does not require a vanishing compression error for the gradient norm to converge to zero for smooth nonconvex problems. By leveraging error feedback, our method can achieve a $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate for a sufficiently large batch size, improving over the state-of-the-art $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ compression error, and matching the rate of uncompressed methods. Further, when the objective function satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, our method converges linearly. In addition to improving convergence, our method also supports the use of private labels. Numerical experiments show that EF-VFL significantly improves over the prior art, confirming our theoretical results. The code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Valdeira/EF-VFL.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet the choice of which model to use often involves a trade-off between performance and cost. More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver R. A. Dunbar, Nicholas H. Nelsen, Maya Mutic</p>
<p>Abstract: Randomized algorithms exploit stochasticity to reduce computational complexity. One important example is random feature regression (RFR) that accelerates Gaussian process regression (GPR). RFR approximates an unknown function with a random neural network whose hidden weights and biases are sampled from a probability distribution. Only the final output layer is fit to data. In randomized algorithms like RFR, the hyperparameters that characterize the sampling distribution greatly impact performance, yet are not directly accessible from samples. This makes optimization of hyperparameters via standard (gradient-based) optimization tools inapplicable. Inspired by Bayesian ideas from GPR, this paper introduces a random objective function that is tailored for hyperparameter tuning of vector-valued random features. The objective is minimized with ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). EKI is a gradient-free particle-based optimizer that is scalable to high-dimensions and robust to randomness in objective functions. A numerical study showcases the new black-box methodology to learn hyperparameter distributions in several problems that are sensitive to the hyperparameter selection: two global sensitivity analyses, integrating a chaotic dynamical system, and solving a Bayesian inverse problem from atmospheric dynamics. The success of the proposed EKI-based algorithm for RFR suggests its potential for automated optimization of hyperparameters arising in other randomized algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant strides in complex tasks but struggles in multi-task settings with different embodiments. World model methods offer scalability by learning a simulation of the environment but often rely on inefficient gradient-free optimization methods for policy extraction. In contrast, gradient-based methods exhibit lower variance but fail to handle discontinuities. Our work reveals that well-regularized world models can generate smoother optimization landscapes than the actual dynamics, facilitating more effective first-order optimization. We introduce Policy learning with multi-task World Models (PWM), a novel model-based RL algorithm for continuous control. Initially, the world model is pre-trained on offline data, and then policies are extracted from it using first-order optimization in less than 10 minutes per task. PWM effectively solves tasks with up to 152 action dimensions and outperforms methods that use ground-truth dynamics. Additionally, PWM scales to an 80-task setting, achieving up to 27% higher rewards than existing baselines without relying on costly online planning.

Our results demonstrate that DCOC enhances throughput by up to 37.95% while reducing optimization time by up to 42.2% across various DNN models, outperforming current state-of-the-art frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pratik Rathore, Zachary Frangella, Jiaming Yang, Micha{\l} Derezi\'nski, Madeleine Udell</p>
<p>Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a fundamental computational tool, appearing in problems that range from computational chemistry to health analytics, with a particular interest due to its starring role in Gaussian process regression. However, full KRR solvers are challenging to scale to large datasets: both direct (i.e., Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (i.e., PCG) incur prohibitive computational and storage costs. The standard approach to scale KRR to large datasets chooses a set of inducing points and solves an approximate version of the problem, inducing points KRR. However, the resulting solution tends to have worse predictive performance than the full KRR solution. In this work, we introduce a new solver, ASkotch, for full KRR that provides better solutions faster than state-of-the-art solvers for full and inducing points KRR. ASkotch is a scalable, accelerated, iterative method for full KRR that provably obtains linear convergence. Under appropriate conditions, we show that ASkotch obtains condition-number-free linear convergence. This convergence analysis rests on the theory of ridge leverage scores and determinantal point processes. ASkotch outperforms state-of-the-art KRR solvers on a testbed of 23 large-scale KRR regression and classification tasks derived from a wide range of application domains, demonstrating the superiority of full KRR over inducing points KRR. Our work opens up the possibility of as-yet-unimagined applications of full KRR across a number of disciplines.</p>

I demonstrate the ability of QT-DNN to recognise optical illusions like a human. Tasking QT-DNN to simulate human perception of the Necker cube and Rubin's vase, I provide arguments in favour of the superiority of QT-based activation functions over the activation functions optimised for modern applications in machine vision, also showing that, at the fundamental level, QT-DNN is closely related to biology-inspired DNNs and models based on the principles of quantum information processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Kumar Singh, Vishwajeet kumar, Rudra Murthy, Jaydeep Sen, Ashish Mittal, Ganesh Ramakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on unseen tasks in English, but their abilities in non English languages are less explored due to limited benchmarks and training data. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Indic QA Benchmark, a large dataset for context grounded question answering in 11 major Indian languages, covering both extractive and abstractive tasks. Evaluations of multilingual LLMs, including instruction finetuned versions, revealed weak performance in low resource languages due to a strong English language bias in their training data. We also investigated the Translate Test paradigm,where inputs are translated to English for processing and the results are translated back into the source language for output. This approach outperformed multilingual LLMs, particularly in low resource settings. By releasing Indic QA, we aim to promote further research into LLMs question answering capabilities in low resource languages. This benchmark offers a critical resource to address existing limitations and foster multilingual understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srinath Mahankali, Zhang-Wei Hong, Ayush Sekhari, Alexander Rakhlin, Pulkit Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Random Latent Exploration (RLE), a simple yet effective exploration strategy in reinforcement learning (RL). On average, RLE outperforms noise-based methods, which perturb the agent's actions, and bonus-based exploration, which rewards the agent for attempting novel behaviors. The core idea of RLE is to encourage the agent to explore different parts of the environment by pursuing randomly sampled goals in a latent space. RLE is as simple as noise-based methods, as it avoids complex bonus calculations but retains the deep exploration benefits of bonus-based methods. Our experiments show that RLE improves performance on average in both discrete (e.g., Atari) and continuous control tasks (e.g., Isaac Gym), enhancing exploration while remaining a simple and general plug-in for existing RL algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze Yu Zhang, Arun Verma, Finale Doshi-Velez, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in decision-making, but their reliability, especially in critical tasks like healthcare, is not well-established. Therefore, understanding how LLMs reason and make decisions is crucial for their safe deployment. This paper investigates how the uncertainty of responses generated by LLMs relates to the information provided in the input prompt. Leveraging the insight that LLMs learn to infer latent concepts during pretraining, we propose a prompt-response concept model that explains how LLMs generate responses and helps understand the relationship between prompts and response uncertainty. We show that the uncertainty decreases as the prompt's informativeness increases, similar to epistemic uncertainty. Our detailed experimental results on real-world datasets validate our proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Tang, Ye Liu, Xi Zhao, Xukai Liu, Yanghai Zhang, Kai Zhang, Xiaofang Zhou, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinluan Yang, Zhengyu Chen, Teng Xiao, Wenqiao Zhang, Yong Lin, Kun Kuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results for semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs. Notably, most real-world heterophilic graphs are composed of a mixture of nodes with different neighbor patterns, exhibiting local node-level homophilic and heterophilic structures. However, existing works are only devoted to designing better HGNN backbones or architectures for node classification tasks on heterophilic and homophilic graph benchmarks simultaneously, and their analyses of HGNN performance with respect to nodes are only based on the determined data distribution without exploring the effect caused by this structural difference between training and testing nodes. How to learn invariant node representations on heterophilic graphs to handle this structure difference or distribution shifts remains unexplored. In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of previous graph-based invariant learning methods from the perspective of data augmentation. Then, we propose \textbf{HEI}, a framework capable of generating invariant node representations through incorporating heterophily information to infer latent environments without augmentation, which are then used for invariant prediction, under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. We theoretically show that our proposed method can achieve guaranteed performance under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and backbones can also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.

<p>Abstract: Traditional recurrent neural network architectures, such as long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM), have historically held a prominent role in time series forecasting (TSF) tasks. While the recently introduced sLSTM for Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduces exponential gating and memory mixing that are beneficial for long term sequential learning, its potential short memory issue is a barrier to applying sLSTM directly in TSF. To address this, we propose a simple yet efficient algorithm named P-sLSTM, which is built upon sLSTM by incorporating patching and channel independence. These modifications substantially enhance sLSTM's performance in TSF, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justifications for our design, and conduct extensive comparative and analytical experiments to fully validate the efficiency and superior performance of our model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing high-quality features is critical to any quantitative data analysis. While feature engineering was historically addressed by carefully hand-crafting data representations based on domain expertise, deep neural networks (DNNs) now offer a radically different approach. DNNs implicitly engineer features by transforming their input data into hidden feature vectors called embeddings. For embedding vectors produced by foundation models -- which are trained to be useful across many contexts -- we demonstrate that simple and well-studied dimensionality-reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis uncover inherent heterogeneity in input data concordant with human-understandable explanations. Of the many applications for this framework, we find empirical evidence that there is intrinsic separability between real samples and those generated by artificial intelligence (AI).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiyan Wang, Yilun Jin, Yiming Zhang, Victor Junqiu Wei, Han Tian, Li Chen, Jinbao Xue, Yangyu Tao, Di Wang, Kai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to high accuracy, BERT-like models have been widely adopted by text mining and web searching. However, large BERT-like models suffer from inefficient online inference, facing the following two problems on GPUs: (1) their high accuracy relies on the large model depth, which linearly increases the sequential computation on GPUs; (2) stochastic and dynamic online workloads cause extra costs from batching and paddings. Therefore, we present \sys for the real-world setting of GPU inference on online workloads. At its core, \sys adopts stacking distillation and boosting ensemble, distilling the original deep model into a group of shallow but virtually stacked student models running in parallel. This enables \sys to achieve a lower model depth (e.g., two layers) than the others and the lowest inference latency while maintaining accuracy. In addition, adaptive student pruning realizes dynamic student numbers according to changing online workloads. Especially for occasional workload bursts, it can temporarily decrease the student number with minimal accuracy loss to improve system throughput. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness, whose results show that \sys outperforms the baselines by $4.1\times\sim 1.6\times$ in latency while maintaining accuracy and achieves up to $22.27\times$ higher throughput for workload bursts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bao Duong, Hung Le, Biwei Huang, Thin Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has proved a promising alternative for conventional local heuristics in score-based approaches to learning directed acyclic causal graphs (DAGs) from observational data. However, the intricate acyclicity constraint still challenges the efficient exploration of the vast space of DAGs in existing methods. In this study, we introduce ALIAS (reinforced dAg Learning wIthout Acyclicity conStraints), a novel approach to causal discovery powered by the RL machinery. Our method features an efficient policy for generating DAGs in just a single step with an optimal quadratic complexity, fueled by a novel parametrization of DAGs that directly translates a continuous space to the space of all DAGs, bypassing the need for explicitly enforcing acyclicity constraints. This approach enables us to navigate the search space more effectively by utilizing policy gradient methods and established scoring functions. In addition, we provide compelling empirical evidence for the strong performance of ALIAS in comparison with state-of-the-arts in causal discovery over increasingly difficult experiment conditions on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunjun Zhang, Arian Hosseini, Hritik Bansal, Mehran Kazemi, Aviral Kumar, Rishabh Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Verifiers or reward models are often used to enhance the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). A common approach is the Best-of-N method, where N candidate solutions generated by the LLM are ranked by a verifier, and the best one is selected. While LLM-based verifiers are typically trained as discriminative classifiers to score solutions, they do not utilize the text generation capabilities of pretrained LLMs. To overcome this limitation, we instead propose training verifiers using the ubiquitous next-token prediction objective, jointly on verification and solution generation. Compared to standard verifiers, such generative verifiers (GenRM) can benefit from several advantages of LLMs: they integrate seamlessly with instruction tuning, enable chain-of-thought reasoning, and can utilize additional test-time compute via majority voting for better verification. We demonstrate that GenRM outperforms discriminative, DPO verifiers, and LLM-as-a-Judge, resulting in large performance gains with Best-of-N, namely 5% $\rightarrow$ 45.3% on algorithmic tasks and 73% $\rightarrow$ 93.4% on GSM8K. In easy-to-hard generalization settings, we observe improvements of 28% $\rightarrow$ 44.6% on MATH, and 37.9% $\rightarrow$ 53.5% on MMLU abstract algebra. Furthermore, we find that training GenRM with synthetic verification rationales is sufficient to pick out subtle errors on math problems. Finally, we demonstrate that GenRM scales favorably with model size and test-time compute.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiran Qiao, Yu Yin, Chen Chen, Jing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: While machine learning models have proven effective across various scenarios, it is widely acknowledged that many models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Recently, there have emerged numerous efforts in adversarial defense. Among them, certified defense is well known for its theoretical guarantees against arbitrary adversarial perturbations on input within a certain range (e.g., $l_2$ ball). However, most existing works in this line struggle to generalize their certified robustness in other data domains with distribution shifts. This issue is rooted in the difficulty of eliminating the negative impact of spurious correlations on robustness in different domains. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel certified defense framework GLEAN, which incorporates a causal perspective into the generalization problem in certified defense. More specifically, our framework integrates a certifiable causal factor learning component to disentangle the causal relations and spurious correlations between input and label, and thereby exclude the negative effect of spurious correlations on defense. On top of that, we design a causally certified defense strategy to handle adversarial attacks on latent causal factors. In this way, our framework is not only robust against malicious noises on data in the training distribution but also can generalize its robustness across domains with distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our framework in certified robustness generalization in different data domains. Code is available in the supplementary materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihang Li, Jin Huang, Jiaxi Zhuang, Yaorui Shi, Xiaochen Cai, Mingjun Xu, Xiang Wang, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Hengxing Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.
  To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Rochman Sharabi, Sacha Lewin, Gilles Louppe</p>
<p>Abstract: Mesh-free Lagrangian methods are widely used for simulating fluids, solids, and their complex interactions due to their ability to handle large deformations and topological changes. These physics simulators, however, require substantial computational resources for accurate simulations. To address these issues, deep learning emulators promise faster and scalable simulations, yet they often remain expensive and difficult to train, limiting their practical use. Inspired by the Material Point Method (MPM), we present NeuralMPM, a neural emulation framework for particle-based simulations. NeuralMPM interpolates Lagrangian particles onto a fixed-size grid, computes updates on grid nodes using image-to-image neural networks, and interpolates back to the particles. Similarly to MPM, NeuralMPM benefits from the regular voxelized representation to simplify the computation of the state dynamics, while avoiding the drawbacks of mesh-based Eulerian methods. We demonstrate the advantages of NeuralMPM on several datasets, including fluid dynamics and fluid-solid interactions. Compared to existing methods, NeuralMPM reduces training times from days to hours, while achieving comparable or superior long-term accuracy, making it a promising approach for practical forward and inverse problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheshun Wu, Junfan Li, Zenglin Xu, Sumei Sun, Jie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning techniques have garnered great interest in designing communication systems owing to their capacity in tacking with channel uncertainty. To provide theoretical guarantees for learning-based communication systems, some recent works analyze generalization bounds for devised methods based on the assumption of Independently and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.) channels, a condition rarely met in practical scenarios. In this paper, we drop the I.I.D. channel assumption and study an online optimization problem of learning to communicate over time-correlated channels. To address this issue, we further focus on two specific tasks: optimizing channel decoders for time-correlated fading channels and selecting optimal codebooks for time-correlated additive noise channels. For utilizing temporal dependence of considered channels to better learn communication systems, we develop two online optimization algorithms based on the optimistic online mirror descent framework. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for proposed algorithms via deriving sub-linear regret bound on the expected error probability of learned systems. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate that our presented approaches can leverage the channel correlation to achieve a lower average symbol error rate compared to baseline methods, consistent with our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Hanzi Mao, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Lawson, Lucy Farnik, Conor Houghton, Laurence Aitchison</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach to interpreting the internal representations of transformer language models. However, SAEs are usually trained separately on each transformer layer, making it difficult to use them to study how information flows across layers. To solve this problem, we introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual stream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual stream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE latents to 'switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers. Interestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single layer for a given token or prompt, but the layer at which an individual latent is active may differ for different tokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over layers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the distributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of magnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token. For larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at multiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual stream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar. Finally, we relax the assumption that the residual stream basis is the same at every layer by applying pre-trained tuned-lens transformations, but our findings remain qualitatively similar. Our results represent a new approach to understanding how representations change as they flow through transformers. We release our code to train and analyze MLSAEs at https://github.com/tim-lawson/mlsae.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) can generate synthetic data samples that closely resemble the original dataset, addressing data scarcity. In this work, we developed a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to augment critical heat flux (CHF) data used for the 2006 Groeneveld lookup table. To compare with traditional methods, a fine-tuned deep neural network (DNN) regression model was evaluated on the same dataset. Both models achieved small mean absolute relative errors, with the CVAE showing more favorable results. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) was performed using repeated CVAE sampling and DNN ensembling. The DNN ensemble improved performance over the baseline, while the CVAE maintained consistent results with less variability and higher confidence. Both models achieved small errors inside and outside the training domain, with slightly larger errors outside. Overall, the CVAE performed better than the DNN in predicting CHF and exhibited better uncertainty behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyue Cheng, Jintao Zhang, Zhiding Liu, Chunli Liu, Yanhu Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) prediction using past physiological signals is crucial, as IOH can lead to inadequate organ perfusion, increasing the risk of severe complications and mortality. However, existing IOH prediction methods often rely on static modeling, overlooking the complex temporal dependencies and non-stationary nature of physiological signals. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Multi-Factor (HMF) network that models IOH prediction as a dynamic sequence forecasting problem, explicitly capturing temporal dependencies and physiological non-stationarity.. Specifically, we formalize physiological signal dynamics as a sequence of multivariate time series, and decompose them into trend and seasonal components, enabling distinct modeling of long-term and periodic variations. For each component, we employ a patch-based Transformer encoder to extract representative features with the concern of computational efficiency and representation quality. Furthermore, to mitigate distributional drift arising from the evolving signals, we introduce a symmetric normalization mechanism. Extensive experiments on both a publicly available dataset and a private dataset collected from real-world hospital settings demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines. We hope HMF offers a new perspective on IOH prediction and further enhances surgical safety. Our code is open-sourced and available at \footnote{https://github.com/Mingyue-Cheng/HMF}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Melis Ilayda Bal, Pier Giuseppe Sessa, Mojmir Mutny, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johan Bjorck, Alon Benhaim, Vishrav Chaudhary, Furu Wei, Xia Song</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art LLMs are powered by scaling -- scaling model size, dataset size and cluster size. It is economically infeasible to extensively tune hyperparameter for the largest runs. Instead, approximately optimal hyperparameters must be inferred or \textit{transferred} from smaller experiments. Hyperparameter transfer across model sizes has been studied in Yang et al. However, hyperparameter transfer across dataset size -- or token horizon -- has not been studied yet. To remedy this we conduct a large scale empirical study on how optimal learning rate (LR) depends on token horizon in LLM training. We first demonstrate that the optimal LR changes significantly with token horizon -- longer training necessitates smaller LR. Secondly we demonstrate the the optimal LR follows a scaling law, and that the optimal LR for longer horizons can be accurately estimated from shorter horizons via such scaling laws. We also provide a rule-of-thumb for transferring LR across token horizons with zero overhead over current practices. Lastly we provide evidence that LLama-1 used too high LR, and estimate the performance hit from this. We thus argue that hyperparameter transfer across data size is an important and overlooked component of LLM training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas P. Zollo, Andrew Wei Tung Siah, Naimeng Ye, Ang Li, Hongseok Namkoong</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs become capable of complex tasks, there is growing potential for personalized interactions tailored to the subtle and idiosyncratic preferences of the user. We present a public benchmark, PersonalLLM, focusing on adapting LLMs to provide maximal benefits for a particular user. Departing from existing alignment benchmarks that implicitly assume uniform preferences, we curate open-ended prompts paired with many high-quality answers over which users would be expected to display heterogeneous latent preferences. Instead of persona-prompting LLMs based on high-level attributes (e.g., user's race or response length), which yields homogeneous preferences relative to humans, we develop a method that can simulate a large user base with diverse preferences from a set of pre-trained reward models. Our dataset and generated personalities offer an innovative testbed for developing personalization algorithms that grapple with continual data sparsity--few relevant feedback from the particular user--by leveraging historical data from other (similar) users. We explore basic in-context learning and meta-learning baselines to illustrate the utility of PersonalLLM and highlight the need for future methodological development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sharmishtha Dutta, Alex Gittens, Mohammed J. Zaki, Charu C. Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) completion aims to identify additional facts that can be inferred from the existing facts in the KG. Recent developments in this field have explored this task in the inductive setting, where at test time one sees entities that were not present during training; the most performant models in the inductive setting have employed path encoding modules in addition to standard subgraph encoding modules. This work similarly focuses on KG completion in the inductive setting, without the explicit use of path encodings, which can be time-consuming and introduces several hyperparameters that require costly hyperparameter optimization. Our approach uses a Transformer-based subgraph encoding module only; we introduce connection-biased attention and entity role embeddings into the subgraph encoding module to eliminate the need for an expensive and time-consuming path encoding module. Evaluations on standard inductive KG completion benchmark datasets demonstrate that our \textbf{C}onnection-\textbf{B}iased \textbf{Li}nk \textbf{P}rediction (CBLiP) model has superior performance to models that do not use path information. Compared to models that utilize path information, CBLiP shows competitive or superior performance while being faster. Additionally, to show that the effectiveness of connection-biased attention and entity role embeddings also holds in the transductive setting, we compare CBLiP's performance on the relation prediction task in the transductive setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cooper Lorsung, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of data-driven machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. The recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models, allowing easy integration of additional system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations through text. In this work, we explore using pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts of known system information into PDE learning. Using FactFormer as our testing backbone, we add a multimodal block to fuse numerical and textual information. We compare sentence-level embeddings, word-level embeddings, and a standard tokenizer across 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow-Water data sets. These challenging benchmarks show that pretrained LLMs are able to utilize text descriptions of system information and enable accurate prediction using only initial conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Ghane, Danil Akhtiamov, Babak Hassibi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of transfer learning and fine-tuning in linear models for both regression and binary classification. In particular, we consider the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a linear model initialized with pretrained weights and using a small training data set from the target distribution. In the asymptotic regime of large models, we provide an exact and rigorous analysis and relate the generalization errors (in regression) and classification errors (in binary classification) for the pretrained and fine-tuned models. In particular, we give conditions under which the fine-tuned model outperforms the pretrained one. An important aspect of our work is that all the results are "universal", in the sense that they depend only on the first and second order statistics of the target distribution. They thus extend well beyond the standard Gaussian assumptions commonly made in the literature. Furthermore, our universality results extend beyond standard SGD training to the test error of a classification task trained using a ridge regression.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Hybrid-Autoregressive INference TrANsducers (HAINAN), a novel architecture for speech recognition that extends the Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) model. Trained with randomly masked predictor network outputs, HAINAN supports both autoregressive inference with all network components and non-autoregressive inference without the predictor. Additionally, we propose a novel semi-autoregressive inference paradigm that first generates an initial hypothesis using non-autoregressive inference, followed by refinement steps where each token prediction is regenerated using parallelized autoregression on the initial hypothesis. Experiments on multiple datasets across different languages demonstrate that HAINAN achieves efficiency parity with CTC in non-autoregressive mode and with TDT in autoregressive mode. In terms of accuracy, autoregressive HAINAN outperforms TDT and RNN-T, while non-autoregressive HAINAN significantly outperforms CTC. Semi-autoregressive inference further enhances the model's accuracy with minimal computational overhead, and even outperforms TDT results in some cases. These results highlight HAINAN's flexibility in balancing accuracy and speed, positioning it as a strong candidate for real-world speech recognition applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Madison Cooley, Varun Shankar, Robert M. Kirby, Shandian Zhe</p>
<p>Abstract: Interest is rising in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a mesh-free alternative to traditional numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs often struggle to learn high-frequency and multi-scale target solutions. To tackle this problem, we first study a strong Boundary Condition (BC) version of PINNs for Dirichlet BCs and observe a consistent decline in relative error compared to the standard PINNs. We then perform a theoretical analysis based on the Fourier transform and convolution theorem. We find that strong BC PINNs can better learn the amplitudes of high-frequency components of the target solutions. However, constructing the architecture for strong BC PINNs is difficult for many BCs and domain geometries. Enlightened by our theoretical analysis, we propose Fourier PINNs -- a simple, general, yet powerful method that augments PINNs with pre-specified, dense Fourier bases. Our proposed architecture likewise learns high-frequency components better but places no restrictions on the particular BCs or problem domains. We develop an adaptive learning and basis selection algorithm via alternating neural net basis optimization, Fourier and neural net basis coefficient estimation, and coefficient truncation. This scheme can flexibly identify the significant frequencies while weakening the nominal frequencies to better capture the target solution's power spectrum. We show the advantage of our approach through a set of systematic experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by training neural networks with loss functions that incorporate physical constraints. In this work, we introduce HyResPINNs, a novel class of PINNs featuring adaptive hybrid residual blocks that integrate standard neural networks and radial basis function (RBF) networks. A distinguishing characteristic of HyResPINNs is the use of adaptive combination parameters within each residual block, enabling dynamic weighting of the neural and RBF network contributions. Our empirical evaluation of a diverse set of challenging PDE problems demonstrates that HyResPINNs consistently achieve superior accuracy to baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of HyResPINNs to bridge the gap between classical numerical methods and modern machine learning-based solvers, paving the way for more robust and adaptive approaches to physics-informed modeling.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06270">Mixture Compressor for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs Gains More</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Huang, Yue Liao, Jianhui Liu, Ruifei He, Haoru Tan, Shiming Zhang, Hongsheng Li, Si Liu, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts large language models (MoE-LLMs) marks a significant step forward of language models, however, they encounter two critical challenges in practice: 1) expert parameters lead to considerable memory consumption and loading latency; and 2) the current activated experts are redundant, as many tokens may only require a single expert. Motivated by these issues, we investigate the MoE-LLMs and make two key observations: a) different experts exhibit varying behaviors on activation reconstruction error, routing scores, and activated frequencies, highlighting their differing importance, and b) not all tokens are equally important -- only a small subset is critical. Building on these insights, we propose MC, a training-free Mixture-Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which leverages the significance of both experts and tokens to achieve an extreme compression. First, to mitigate storage and loading overheads, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization, which formulates the adaptive bit-width allocation as a Linear Programming problem, where the objective function balances multi-factors reflecting the importance of each expert. Additionally, we develop Online Dynamic Pruning, which identifies important tokens to retain and dynamically select activated experts for other tokens during inference to optimize efficiency while maintaining performance. Our MC integrates static quantization and dynamic pruning to collaboratively achieve extreme compression for MoE-LLMs with less accuracy loss, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, at 2.54 bits, MC compresses 76.6% of the model, with only a 3.8% average accuracy loss. During dynamic inference, we further reduce activated parameters by 15%, with a performance drop of less than 0.6%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kawisorn Kamtue, Jose M. F. Moura, Orathai Sangpetch</p>
<p>Abstract: Can neural networks solve math problems using first a principle alone? This paper shows how to leverage the fundamental theorem of the calculus of variations to design deep neural networks to solve functional optimization without requiring training data (e.g., ground-truth optimal solutions). Our approach is particularly crucial when the solution is a function defined over an unknown interval or support\textemdash such as in minimum-time control problems. By incorporating the necessary conditions satisfied by the optimal function solution, as derived from the calculus of variation, in the design of the deep architecture, CalVNet leverages overparameterized neural networks to learn these optimal functions directly. We validate CalVNet by showing that, without relying on ground-truth data and simply incorporating first principles, it successfully derives the Kalman filter for linear filtering, the bang-bang optimal control for minimum-time problems, and finds geodesics on manifolds. Our results demonstrate that CalVNet can be trained in an unsupervised manner, without relying on ground-truth data, establishing a promising framework for addressing general, potentially unsolved functional optimization problems that still lack analytical solutions.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06287">Non-Halting Queries: Exploiting Fixed Points in LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghaith Hammouri, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new vulnerability that exploits fixed points in autoregressive models and use it to craft queries that never halt. More precisely, for non-halting queries, the LLM never samples the end-of-string token <eos>. We rigorously analyze the conditions under which the non-halting anomaly presents itself. In particular, at temperature zero, we prove that if a repeating (cyclic) token sequence is observed at the output beyond the context size, then the LLM does not halt.
  We demonstrate non-halting queries in many experiments performed in base unaligned models where repeating prompts immediately lead to a non-halting cyclic behavior as predicted by the analysis. Further, we develop a simple recipe that takes the same fixed points observed in the base model and creates a prompt structure to target aligned models. We demonstrate the recipe's success in sending every major model released over the past year into a non-halting state with the same simple prompt even over higher temperatures. Further, we devise an experiment with 100 randomly selected tokens and show that the recipe to create non-halting queries succeeds with high success rates ranging from 97% for GPT-4o to 19% for Gemini Pro 1.5. These results show that the proposed adversarial recipe succeeds in bypassing alignment at one to two orders of magnitude higher rates compared to earlier reports.
  We also study gradient-based direct inversion using ARCA to craft new short prompts to induce the non-halting state. We inverted 10,000 random repeating 2-cycle outputs for llama-3.1-8b-instruct. Out of 10,000 three-token inverted prompts 1,512 yield non-halting queries reaching a rate of 15%. Our experiments with ARCA show that non-halting may be easily induced with as few as 3 input tokens with high probability. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that non-halting queries are prevalent and relatively easy to find.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Chen, Yingyu Liang, Zhizhou Sha, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, but their performance on long-context tasks is often limited by the computational complexity of attention mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach to accelerate attention computation in LLMs, particularly for long-context scenarios. We leverage the inherent sparsity within attention mechanisms, both in conventional Softmax attention and ReLU attention (with $\mathsf{ReLU}^\alpha$ activation, $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}_+$), to significantly reduce the running time complexity. Our method employs a Half-Space Reporting (HSR) data structure to identify non-zero or ``massively activated'' entries in the attention matrix. We present theoretical analyses for two key scenarios: generation decoding and prompt prefilling. Our approach achieves a running time of $O(mn^{4/5})$ significantly faster than the naive approach $O(mn)$ for generation decoding, where $n$ is the context length, $m$ is the query length, and $d$ is the hidden dimension. We can also reduce the running time for prompt prefilling from $O(mn)$ to $O(mn^{1 - 1 / \lfloor d/2\rfloor} + mn^{4/5})$. Our method introduces only provably negligible error for Softmax attention. This work represents a significant step towards enabling efficient long-context processing in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, research on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has gained significant attention due to the prevalence of free-text node features in real-world applications and the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that bolster TAG methodologies. However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwei Yang, Zheng Chen, Xin Liu, Rikuto Kotoge, Peng Chen, Yasuko Matsubara, Yasushi Sakurai, Jimeng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieving gene functional networks from knowledge databases presents a challenge due to the mismatch between disease networks and subtype-specific variations. Current solutions, including statistical and deep learning methods, often fail to effectively integrate gene interaction knowledge from databases or explicitly learn subtype-specific interactions. To address this mismatch, we propose GeSubNet, which learns a unified representation capable of predicting gene interactions while distinguishing between different disease subtypes. Graphs generated by such representations can be considered subtype-specific networks. GeSubNet is a multi-step representation learning framework with three modules: First, a deep generative model learns distinct disease subtypes from patient gene expression profiles. Second, a graph neural network captures representations of prior gene networks from knowledge databases, ensuring accurate physical gene interactions. Finally, we integrate these two representations using an inference loss that leverages graph generation capabilities, conditioned on the patient separation loss, to refine subtype-specific information in the learned representation. GeSubNet consistently outperforms traditional methods, with average improvements of 30.6%, 21.0%, 20.1%, and 56.6% across four graph evaluation metrics, averaged over four cancer datasets. Particularly, we conduct a biological simulation experiment to assess how the behavior of selected genes from over 11,000 candidates affects subtypes or patient distributions. The results show that the generated network has the potential to identify subtype-specific genes with an 83% likelihood of impacting patient distribution shifts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Zhang, Mingyue Cheng, Xiaoyu Tao, Zhiding Liu, Daoyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting models are becoming increasingly prevalent due to their critical role in decision-making across various domains. However, most existing approaches represent the coupled temporal patterns, often neglecting the distinction between its specific components. In particular, fluctuating patterns and smooth trends within time series exhibit distinct characteristics. In this work, to model complicated temporal patterns, we propose a Conditional Denoising Polynomial Modeling (CDPM) framework, where probabilistic diffusion models and deterministic linear models are trained end-to-end. Instead of modeling the coupled time series, CDPM decomposes it into trend and seasonal components for modeling them separately. To capture the fluctuating seasonal component, we employ a probabilistic diffusion model based on statistical properties from the historical window. For the smooth trend component, a module is proposed to enhance linear models by incorporating historical dependencies, thereby preserving underlying trends and mitigating noise distortion. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the potential of combining probabilistic and deterministic models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Roy, Vansh Bansal, Purnamrita Sarkar, Alessandro Rinaldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and denoising. Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) designed a novel alternative generative model Rectified Flow (RF), which aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two key theoretical contributions: 1) we provide the first theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a \textit{new formulation of straightness} stronger than that in the original work. 2) under a mild regularity assumption, we show that for a rectified flow from a Gaussian to any general target distribution with finite first moment (e.g. mixture of Gaussians), two rectifications are sufficient to achieve a straight flow, which is in line with the previous empirical findings. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoqi Yu, Yaoming Li, Xiaoyu Guo, Dayu Wang, Zirui Liu, Shujun Wang, Tong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting models are pivotal in a data-driven world with vast volumes of time series data that appear as a compound of vast Linear and Nonlinear patterns. Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize seasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a strategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving the other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual. Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level decomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in real-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition by introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This deeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear patterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models nonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The extraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To achieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear pattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a novel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably, the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks under univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that current forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through this advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offer insight into designing more effective forecasting models. Code is available at this Repository: https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/LiNo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Wilcoxson, Qiyang Li, Kevin Frans, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised pretraining has been transformative in many supervised domains. However, applying such ideas to reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in that fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data, but rather exploring and locating the solution through iterative self-improvement. In this work, we study how unlabeled offline trajectory data can be leveraged to learn efficient exploration strategies. While prior data can be used to pretrain a set of low-level skills, or as additional off-policy data for online RL, it has been unclear how to combine these ideas effectively for online exploration. Our method SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration) demonstrates that a careful combination of these ideas compounds their benefits. Our method first extracts low-level skills using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and then pseudo-labels unlabeled trajectories with optimistic rewards and high-level action labels, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples that encourage novelty-seeking behavior. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. In our experiments, SUPE consistently outperforms prior strategies across a suite of 42 long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Code: https://github.com/rail-berkeley/supe.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nithin Somasekharan, Shaowu Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchun Wang, Yuanzhou Chen, Zichuan Liu, Zhanwen Chen, Haifeng Chen, Xiang Zhang, Wei Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Andrecut</p>
<p>Abstract: The single-layer feedforward neural network with random weights is a recurring motif in the neural networks literature. The advantage of these networks is their simplified training, which reduces to solving a ridge-regression problem. A general assumption is that these networks require a large number of hidden neurons relative to the dimensionality of the data samples, in order to achieve good classification accuracy. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that one can obtain good classification results even if the number of hidden neurons has the same order of magnitude as the dimensionality of the data samples, if this dimensionality is reasonably high. Inspired by this result, we also develop an efficient iterative residual training method for such random neural networks, and we extend the algorithm to the least-squares kernel version of the neural network model. Moreover, we also describe an encryption (obfuscation) method which can be used to protect both the data and the resulted network model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ya-Wei Eileen Lin, Ronald R. Coifman, Gal Mishne, Ronen Talmon</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding meaningful distances between high-dimensional data samples is an important scientific task. To this end, we propose a new tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD) for high-dimensional data with two key aspects. First, our TWD is specifically designed for data with a latent feature hierarchy, i.e., the features lie in a hierarchical space, in contrast to the usual focus on embedding samples in hyperbolic space. Second, while the conventional use of TWD is to speed up the computation of the Wasserstein distance, we use its inherent tree as a means to learn the latent feature hierarchy. The key idea of our method is to embed the features into a multi-scale hyperbolic space using diffusion geometry and then present a new tree decoding method by establishing analogies between the hyperbolic embedding and trees. We show that our TWD computed based on data observations provably recovers the TWD defined with the latent feature hierarchy and that its computation is efficient and scalable. We showcase the usefulness of the proposed TWD in applications to word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, demonstrating its advantages over existing TWDs and methods based on pre-trained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcus Williams, Micah Carroll, Adhyyan Narang, Constantin Weisser, Brendan Murphy, Anca Dragan</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eldar Kurtic, Alexandre Marques, Shubhra Pandit, Mark Kurtz, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization is a powerful tool for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, but the accuracy-performance trade-offs across different formats remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct the most comprehensive empirical study to date, evaluating FP8, INT8, and INT4 quantization across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Through over 500,000 evaluations, our investigation yields several key findings: (1) FP8 (W8A8-FP) is effectively lossless across all model scales, (2) well-tuned INT8 (W8A8-INT) achieves surprisingly low (1-3\%) accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only (W4A16-INT) is more competitive than expected, rivaling 8-bit quantization. Further, we investigate the optimal quantization format for different deployments by analyzing inference performance through the popular vLLM framework. Our analysis provides clear deployment recommendations: W4A16 is the most cost-efficient for synchronous setups, while W8A8 dominates in asynchronous continuous batching. For mixed workloads, the optimal choice depends on the specific use case. Our findings offer practical, data-driven guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs at scale -- ensuring the best balance between speed, efficiency, and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cem \"Uy\"uk, Mike Lasby, Mohamed Yassin, Utku Evci, Yani Ioannou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large neural networks exhibit exceptional performance across numerous tasks, yet their considerable size often hinders deployment on resource-constrained systems. While various model compression strategies have been well studied, parameter sharing remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Fine-grained Parameter Sharing (FiPS), a novel algorithm that leverages parameter sharing, tensor decomposition, and sparsity to effectively compress large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). FiPS employs a shared base and sparse factors to represent neurons across multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, where initialization is guided by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and subsequent optimization is conducted through block-wise reconstruction error minimization. Experimental results show that FiPS reduces the parameter budget of MLP modules by 50-75% for DeiT-B and Swin-L and by 40-50% for various Gemma-2 and Llama-3 models while maintaining ViT model accuracy within 1% pt. of the original and LLM perplexity with negligible degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yachao Yuan, Yu Huang, Jin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised Learning plays a crucial role in network anomaly detection applications, however, learning anomaly patterns with limited labeled samples is not easy. Additionally, the lack of interpretability creates key barriers to the adoption of semi-supervised frameworks in practice. Most existing interpretation methods are developed for supervised/unsupervised frameworks or non-security domains and fail to provide reliable interpretations. In this paper, we propose AnomalyAID, a general framework aiming to (1) make the anomaly detection process interpretable and improve the reliability of interpretation results, and (2) assign high-confidence pseudo labels to unlabeled samples for improving the performance of anomaly detection systems with limited supervised data. For (1), we propose a novel interpretation approach that leverages global and local interpreters to provide reliable explanations, while for (2), we design a new two-stage semi-supervised learning framework for network anomaly detection by aligning both stages' model predictions with special constraints. We apply AnomalyAID over two representative network anomaly detection tasks and extensively evaluate AnomalyAID with representative prior works. Experimental results demonstrate that AnomalyAID can provide accurate detection results with reliable interpretations for semi-supervised network anomaly detection systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Garg, Trilok Padhi, Hemang Jain, Ugur Kursuncu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Toxicity identification in online multimodal environments remains a challenging task due to the complexity of contextual connections across modalities (e.g., textual and visual). In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes. Our approach extracts sub-knowledge graphs from ConceptNet, a large-scale commonsense Knowledge Graph (KG) to be infused within a compact VLM framework. The relational context between toxic phrases in captions and memes, as well as visual concepts in memes enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results from our study on two hate speech benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%, respectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task, our approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e. KG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a hybrid neurosymbolic approach. This is crucial for real-world applications where accurate and scalable recognition of toxic content is critical for creating safer online environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide critical insights for applications in disease diagnosis and healthcare. However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose Graph-Enhanced EEG Foundation Model (GEFM), a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning based surrogate models offer researchers powerful tools for accelerating simulation-based workflows. However, as standard datasets in this space often cover small classes of physical behavior, it can be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the Well: a large-scale collection of datasets containing numerical simulations of a wide variety of spatiotemporal physical systems. The Well draws from domain experts and numerical software developers to provide 15TB of data across 16 datasets covering diverse domains such as biological systems, fluid dynamics, acoustic scattering, as well as magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of extra-galactic fluids or supernova explosions. These datasets can be used individually or as part of a broader benchmark suite. To facilitate usage of the Well, we provide a unified PyTorch interface for training and evaluating models. We demonstrate the function of this library by introducing example baselines that highlight the new challenges posed by the complex dynamics of the Well.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyi Chen, Ying Chen, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the performative policy learning problem, where agents adjust their features in response to a released policy to improve their potential outcomes, inducing an endogenous distribution shift. There has been growing interest in training machine learning models in strategic environments, including strategic classification and performative prediction. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions: micro-level utility models in strategic classification and macro-level data distribution maps in performative prediction, severely limiting scalability and generalizability. We approach this problem as a complex causal inference task, relaxing parametric assumptions on both micro-level agent behavior and macro-level data distribution. Leveraging bounded rationality, we uncover a practical low-dimensional structure in distribution shifts and construct an effective mediator in the causal path from the deployed model to the shifted data. We then propose a gradient-based policy optimization algorithm with a differentiable classifier as a substitute for the high-dimensional distribution map. Our algorithm efficiently utilizes batch feedback and limited manipulation patterns. Our approach achieves high sample efficiency compared to methods reliant on bandit feedback or zero-order optimization. We also provide theoretical guarantees for algorithmic convergence. Extensive and challenging experiments on high-dimensional settings demonstrate our method's practical efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anubha Mahajan, Shreya Hegde, Ethan Shay, Daniel Wu, Aviva Prins</p>
<p>Abstract: In India, the majority of farmers are classified as small or marginal, making their livelihoods particularly vulnerable to economic losses due to market saturation and climate risks. Effective crop planning can significantly impact their expected income, yet existing decision support systems (DSS) often provide generic recommendations that fail to account for real-time market dynamics and the interactions among multiple farmers. In this paper, we evaluate the viability of three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for optimizing total farmer income and promoting fairness in crop planning: Independent Q-Learning (IQL), where each farmer acts independently without coordination, Agent-by-Agent (ABA), which sequentially optimizes each farmer's policy in relation to the others, and the Multi-agent Rollout Policy, which jointly optimizes all farmers' actions for global reward maximization. Our results demonstrate that while IQL offers computational efficiency with linear runtime, it struggles with coordination among agents, leading to lower total rewards and an unequal distribution of income. Conversely, the Multi-agent Rollout policy achieves the highest total rewards and promotes equitable income distribution among farmers but requires significantly more computational resources, making it less practical for large numbers of agents. ABA strikes a balance between runtime efficiency and reward optimization, offering reasonable total rewards with acceptable fairness and scalability. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate MARL approaches in DSS to provide personalized and equitable crop planning recommendations, advancing the development of more adaptive and farmer-centric agricultural decision-making systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khoat Than, Dat Phan, Giang Vu</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness and generalization ability of machine learning models are of utmost importance in various application domains. There is a wide interest in efficient ways to analyze those properties. One important direction is to analyze connection between those two properties. Prior theories suggest that a robust learning algorithm can produce trained models with a high generalization ability. However, we show in this work that the existing error bounds are vacuous for the Bayes optimal classifier which is the best among all measurable classifiers for a classification problem with overlapping classes. Those bounds cannot converge to the true error of this ideal classifier. This is undesirable, surprizing, and never known before. We then present a class of novel bounds, which are model-dependent and provably tighter than the existing robustness-based ones. Unlike prior ones, our bounds are guaranteed to converge to the true error of the best classifier, as the number of samples increases. We further provide an extensive experiment and find that two of our bounds are often non-vacuous for a large class of deep neural networks, pretrained from ImageNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephen Robbins</p>
<p>Abstract: We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Gao, Chenhao Zhang, Fengge Wu, Junsuo Zhao, Changwen Zheng, Huaping Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kart-Leong Lim, Xudong Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalable algorithms of posterior approximation allow Bayesian nonparametrics such as Dirichlet process mixture to scale up to larger dataset at fractional cost. Recent algorithms, notably the stochastic variational inference performs local learning from minibatch. The main problem with stochastic variational inference is that it relies on closed form solution. Stochastic gradient ascent is a modern approach to machine learning and is widely deployed in the training of deep neural networks. In this work, we explore using stochastic gradient ascent as a fast algorithm for the posterior approximation of Dirichlet process mixture. However, stochastic gradient ascent alone is not optimal for learning. In order to achieve both speed and performance, we turn our focus to stepsize optimization in stochastic gradient ascent. As as intermediate approach, we first optimize stepsize using the momentum method. Finally, we introduce Fisher information to allow adaptive stepsize in our posterior approximation. In the experiments, we justify that our approach using stochastic gradient ascent do not sacrifice performance for speed when compared to closed form coordinate ascent learning on these datasets. Lastly, our approach is also compatible with deep ConvNet features as well as scalable to large class datasets such as Caltech256 and SUN397.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ka Wai Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have seen extensive application in domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and recommendation systems. However, the irregularity and sparsity of graph data challenge traditional computing methods, which are insufficient to meet the performance demands of GNNs. Recent research has explored parallel acceleration using CUDA Cores and Tensor Cores, but significant challenges persist: (1) kernel fusion leads to false high utilization, failing to treat CUDA and Tensor Cores as independent resources, and (2) heterogeneous cores have distinct computation preferences, causing inefficiencies. To address these issues, this paper proposes FTC-GNN, a novel acceleration framework that efficiently utilizes CUDA and Tensor Cores for GNN computation. FTC-GNN introduces (1) a collaborative design that enables the parallel utilization of CUDA and Tensor Cores and (2) a sparse-to-dense transformation strategy that assigns dense matrix operations to Tensor Cores while leveraging CUDA Cores for data management and sparse edge processing. This design optimizes GPU resource utilization and improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FTC-GNN using GCN and AGNN models across various datasets. For GCN, FTC-GNN achieves speedups of 4.90x, 7.10x, and 1.17x compared to DGL, PyG, and TC-GNN, respectively. For AGNN, it achieves speedups of 5.32x, 2.92x, and 1.02x, establishing its superiority in accelerating GNN computations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanshuang Kong, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie, Ziqiao Wang, Qiang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single one via parameter fusion, achieving improvements across many tasks. However, in the classification task, we find a misalignment issue between merging outputs and the fine-tuned classifier, which limits its effectiveness. In this paper, we first demonstrate the following observations: (1) Merging outputs exhibit the comparable cluster effect with fine-tuned outputs, and already contain necessary classification information; (2) The misalignment between merging outputs and the fine-tuned classifier can converge to an orthogonal transformation, and alleviating this misalignment can significantly enhance the performance of merging models. Based on these observations, we then propose a new protocol FT-Classifier, which fine-tunes an aligned classifier with few-shot unlabeled samples, enabling better evaluation of merging methods and improved classification performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunjin Seo, Kyusung Seo, Joonhyung Park, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have highlighted the critical need of calibrating model predictions, with neighborhood prediction similarity recognized as a pivotal component. Existing studies suggest that nodes with analogous neighborhood prediction similarity often exhibit similar calibration characteristics. Building on this insight, recent approaches incorporate neighborhood similarity into node-wise temperature scaling techniques. However, our analysis reveals that this assumption does not hold universally. Calibration errors can differ significantly even among nodes with comparable neighborhood similarity, depending on their confidence levels. This necessitates a re-evaluation of existing GNN calibration methods, as a single, unified approach may lead to sub-optimal calibration. In response, we introduce **Simi-Mailbox**, a novel approach that categorizes nodes by both neighborhood similarity and their own confidence, irrespective of proximity or connectivity. Our method allows fine-grained calibration by employing *group-specific* temperature scaling, with each temperature tailored to address the specific miscalibration level of affiliated nodes, rather than adhering to a uniform trend based on neighborhood similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our **Simi-Mailbox** across diverse datasets on different GNN architectures, achieving up to 13.79\% error reduction compared to uncalibrated GNN predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ze Gong, Akshat Kumar, Pradeep Varakantham</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taneesh Gupta, Rahul Madhavan, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{REFA}$, a family of reference-free alignment methods that optimize over multiple user preferences while enforcing fine-grained length control. Our approach integrates deviation-based weighting to emphasize high-quality responses, length normalization to prevent trivial short-response solutions, and an EOS-probability regularizer to mitigate dataset-induced brevity biases. Theoretically, we show that under the Uncertainty Reduction with Sequence Length Assertion (URSLA) framework, naive length normalization can still incentivize length-based shortcuts. In contrast, REFA corrects these subtle incentives, guiding models toward genuinely more informative and higher-quality outputs. Empirically, REFA achieves a new $\textbf{state-of-the-art}$ among reference-free alignment methods, generating richer responses that align more closely with human preferences. Notably, REFA improves performance on the AlpacaEval2 benchmark, achieving a $\textbf{26.6%}$ Length-Controlled Win Rate (LC-WR) and $\textbf{24.2%}$ Win Rate (WR).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Song, Ilya Musabirov, Ananya Bhattacharjee, Audrey Durand, Meredith Franklin, Anna Rafferty, Joseph Jay Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: In online educational platforms, adaptive experiment designs play a critical role in personalizing learning pathways, instructional sequencing, and content recommendations. Traditional adaptive policies, such as Thompson Sampling, struggle with scalability in high-dimensional and sparse settings such as when there are large amount of treatments (arms) and limited resources such as funding and time to conduct to a classroom constraint student size. Furthermore, the issue of under-exploration in large-scale educational interventions can lead to suboptimal learning recommendations. To address these challenges, we build upon the concept of lenient regret, which tolerates limited suboptimal selections to enhance exploratory learning, and propose a framework for determining the feasible number of treatments given a sample size. We illustrate these ideas with a case study in online educational learnersourcing examples, where adaptive algorithms dynamically allocate peer-crafted interventions to other students under active recall exercise. Our proposed Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS) algorithm enhances the efficiency of treatment allocation by adjusting sampling weights to balance exploration and exploitation in data-sparse environments. We present comparative evaluations of WAPTS across various sample sizes (N=50, 300, 1000) and treatment conditions, demonstrating its ability to mitigate under-exploration while optimizing learning outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael J. Zellinger, Matt Thomson</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the reliability of large language models (LLMs) has recently garnered significant attention. Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingru Fei, Kun Yi, Wei Fan, Qi Zhang, Zhendong Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an energy amplification technique to address the issue that existing models easily overlook low-energy components in time series forecasting. This technique comprises an energy amplification block and an energy restoration block. The energy amplification block enhances the energy of low-energy components to improve the model's learning efficiency for these components, while the energy restoration block returns the energy to its original level. Moreover, considering that the energy-amplified data typically displays two distinct energy peaks in the frequency spectrum, we integrate the energy amplification technique with a seasonal-trend forecaster to model the temporal relationships of these two peaks independently, serving as the backbone for our proposed model, Amplifier. Additionally, we propose a semi-channel interaction temporal relationship enhancement block for Amplifier, which enhances the model's ability to capture temporal relationships from the perspective of the commonality and specificity of each channel in the data. Extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks consistently demonstrate our model's superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liana Mikaelyan, Ayyoob Imani, Mathew Salvaris, Parth Pathak, Mohsen Fayyaz</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce DeltaLLM, a new post-training compression technique to reduce the memory footprint of LLMs. We propose an alternative way of structuring LLMs with weight sharing between layers in subsequent Transformer blocks, along with additional low-rank difference matrices between them. For training, we adopt the progressing module replacement method and show that the lightweight training of the low-rank modules with approximately 30M-40M tokens is sufficient to achieve performance on par with LLMs of comparable sizes trained from scratch. We release the resultant models, DeltaLLAMA and DeltaPHI, with a 12% parameter reduction, retaining 90% of the performance of the base Llama and Phi models on common knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. Our method also outperforms compression techniques JointDrop, LaCo, ShortGPT and SliceGPT with the same number of parameters removed. For example, DeltaPhi 2.9B with a 24% reduction achieves similar average zero-shot accuracies as recovery fine-tuned SlicedPhi 3.3B with a 12% reduction, despite being approximately 400M parameters smaller with no fine-tuning applied. This work provides new insights into LLM architecture design and compression methods when storage space is critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Liu, Zixuan Xie, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: $Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. It is widely believed that $Q$-learning with linear function approximation (i.e., linear $Q$-learning) suffers from possible divergence until the recent work Meyn (2024) which establishes the ultimate almost sure boundedness of the iterates of linear $Q$-learning. Building on this success, this paper further establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rate of linear $Q$-learning iterates (to a bounded set). Similar to Meyn (2024), we do not make any modification to the original linear $Q$-learning algorithm, do not make any Bellman completeness assumption, and do not make any near-optimality assumption on the behavior policy. All we need is an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy with an adaptive temperature. The key to our analysis is the general result of stochastic approximations under Markovian noise with fast-changing transition functions. As a side product, we also use this general result to establish the $L^2$ convergence rate of tabular $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy, for which we rely on a novel pseudo-contraction property of the weighted Bellman optimality operator.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have established Transformer architectures as the predominant modeling paradigm. Central to the success of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which scores the similarity between query and key matrices to modulate a value matrix. This operation bears striking similarities to digraph convolution, prompting an investigation into whether digraph convolution could serve as an alternative to self-attention. In this study, we formalize this concept by introducing a synthetic unitary digraph convolution based on the digraph Fourier transform. The resulting model, which we term Converter, effectively converts a Transformer into a Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) form. We have tested Converter on Long-Range Arena benchmark, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that Converter achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency and architectural simplicity, which establishes it as a lightweight yet powerful Transformer variant.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Zheng, Guande He, Jianfei Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency distillation is a prevalent way for accelerating diffusion models adopted in consistency (trajectory) models, in which a student model is trained to traverse backward on the probability flow (PF) ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory determined by the teacher model. Preconditioning is a vital technique for stabilizing consistency distillation, by linear combining the input data and the network output with pre-defined coefficients as the consistency function. It imposes the boundary condition of consistency functions without restricting the form and expressiveness of the neural network. However, previous preconditionings are hand-crafted and may be suboptimal choices. In this work, we offer the first theoretical insights into the preconditioning in consistency distillation, by elucidating its design criteria and the connection to the teacher ODE trajectory. Based on these analyses, we further propose a principled way dubbed \textit{Analytic-Precond} to analytically optimize the preconditioning according to the consistency gap (defined as the gap between the teacher denoiser and the optimal student denoiser) on a generalized teacher ODE. We demonstrate that Analytic-Precond can facilitate the learning of trajectory jumpers, enhance the alignment of the student trajectory with the teacher's, and achieve $2\times$ to $3\times$ training acceleration of consistency trajectory models in multi-step generation across various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study employs machine learning, historical analysis, and natural language processing (NLP) to examine recurring lethal stampedes at Indias mass religious gatherings, focusing on the 2025 Mahakumbh tragedy in Prayagraj (48+ deaths) and its 1954 predecessor (700+ casualties). Through computational modeling of crowd dynamics and administrative records, it investigates how systemic vulnerabilities contribute to these disasters. Temporal trend analysis identifies persistent choke points, with narrow riverbank access routes linked to 92% of past stampede sites and lethal crowd densities recurring during spiritually significant moments like Mauni Amavasya. NLP analysis of seven decades of inquiry reports reveals cyclical administrative failures, where VIP route prioritization diverted safety resources in both 1954 and 2025, exacerbating fatalities. Statistical modeling demonstrates how ritual urgency overrides risk perception, leading to panic propagation patterns that mirror historical incidents. Findings support the Institutional Amnesia Theory, highlighting how disaster responses remain reactionary rather than preventive. By correlating archival patterns with computational crowd behavior analysis, this study frames stampedes as a collision of infrastructure limitations, socio spiritual urgency, and governance inertia, challenging disaster discourse to address how spiritual economies normalize preventable mortality.</p>

In response, we introduce CAPE, a novel epidemic pre-training framework designed to harness extensive disease datasets from diverse regions and integrate environmental factors directly into the modeling process for more informed decision-making on downstream diseases. Based on a covariate adjustment framework, CAPE utilizes pre-training combined with hierarchical environment contrasting to identify universal patterns across diseases while estimating latent environmental influences. We have compiled a diverse collection of epidemic time series datasets and validated the effectiveness of CAPE under various evaluation scenarios, including full-shot, few-shot, zero-shot, cross-location, and cross-disease settings, where it outperforms the leading baseline by an average of 9.9% in full-shot and 14.3% in zero-shot settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyu Fan, Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Anil Ramakrishna, Mingyi Hong, Sijia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

<p>Abstract: Access to diverse, high-quality datasets is crucial for machine learning model performance, yet data sharing remains limited by privacy concerns and competitive interests, particularly in regulated domains like healthcare. This dynamic especially disadvantages smaller organizations that lack resources to purchase data or negotiate favorable sharing agreements. We present SecureKL, a privacy-preserving framework that enables organizations to identify beneficial data partnerships without exposing sensitive information. Building on recent advances in dataset combination methods, we develop a secure multiparty computation protocol that maintains strong privacy guarantees while achieving >90\% correlation with plaintext evaluations. In experiments with real-world hospital data, SecureKL successfully identifies beneficial data partnerships that improve model performance for intensive care unit mortality prediction while preserving data privacy. Our framework provides a practical solution for organizations seeking to leverage collective data resources while maintaining privacy and competitive advantages. These results demonstrate the potential for privacy-preserving data collaboration to advance machine learning applications in high-stakes domains while promoting more equitable access to data resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Nair, Puranjay Datta, Jeff Dean, Prateek Jain, Aditya Kusupati</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantizing model weights is critical for reducing the communication and inference costs of large models. However, quantizing models -- especially to low precisions like int4 or int2 -- requires a trade-off in model quality; int2, in particular, is known to severely degrade model quality. Consequently, practitioners are often forced to maintain multiple models with different quantization levels or serve a single model that best satisfies the quality-latency trade-off. On the other hand, integer data types, such as int8, inherently possess a nested (Matryoshka) structure where smaller bit-width integers, like int4 or int2, are nested within the most significant bits. Leveraging this insight, in this paper, we propose Matryoshka Quantization (\alg), a novel multi-scale quantization technique that alleviates the aforementioned challenge. This technique allows us to train and maintain a single quantized model but serve it with the precision demanded by the deployment. Furthermore, leveraging \alg's co-training and co-distillation regularization, int2 precision models extracted by \alg outperform standard int2 quantization by up to to 4\% and 7\% with OmniQuant and QAT as base algorithms respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that by using an extra bit to represent outliers, a model with an effective precision of 2.05-bit gives an additional 6\% improvement with OmniQuant as the base algorithm.</p>

While these models currently do not provide access to token logits, we argue that if such access were available, it would enable more powerful adaptation techniques beyond prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a token-level probability reweighting framework that, given access to logits and a small amount of task-specific data, can effectively steer black-box LLMs toward application-specific content generation. Our approach views next-token prediction through the lens of supervised classification. We show that aligning black-box LLMs with task-specific data can be formulated as a label noise correction problem, leading to \emph{Plugin} model -- an autoregressive probability reweighting model that operates solely on logits. We provide theoretical justification for why reweighting logits alone is sufficient for task adaptation. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets, LLMs, and reweighting models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, advocating for broader access to token logits in closed-source models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Amir Salari, Bahareh Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) transforms healthcare by enabling predictive analytics, personalized treatments, and improved patient outcomes. However, traditional ML workflows often require specialized skills, infrastructure, and resources, limiting accessibility for many healthcare professionals. This paper explores how BigQuery ML Cloud service helps healthcare researchers and data analysts to build and deploy models using SQL, without need for advanced ML knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the Boosted Tree model achieved the highest performance among the three models making it highly effective for diabetes prediction. BigQuery ML directly integrates predictive analytics into their workflows to inform decision-making and support patient care. We reveal this capability through a case study on diabetes prediction using the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset. Our study underscores BigQuery ML's role in democratizing machine learning, enabling faster, scalable, and efficient predictive analytics that can directly enhance healthcare decision-making processes. This study aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning and practical healthcare analytics by providing detailed insights into BigQuery ML's capabilities. By demonstrating its utility in a real-world case study, we highlight its potential to simplify complex workflows and expand access to predictive tools for a broader audience of healthcare professionals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoxuan Xu, Menglu Cui, Chengxiang Huang, Hongfa Wang, Di Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained attention for its capacity to integrate information from different modalities. However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modality dominates while others remain underutilized. Although recent studies have proposed various methods to alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive and fair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream multimodal imbalance algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they employ to mitigate imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely used multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives: performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the experimental workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using BalanceBenchmark, we have identified several key insights into the characteristics and advantages of different method groups in terms of performance, balance degree and computational complexity. We expect such analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to address the imbalance problem in the future, as well as foundation models. The code of the toolkit is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/BalanceBenchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: The paper gives a bound on the generalization error of the Gibbs algorithm, which recovers known data-independent bounds for the high temperature range and extends to the low-temperature range, where generalization depends critically on the data-dependent loss-landscape. It is shown, that with high probability the generalization error of a single hypothesis drawn from the Gibbs posterior decreases with the total prior volume of all hypotheses with similar or smaller empirical error. This gives theoretical support to the belief in the benefit of flat minima. The zero temperature limit is discussed and the bound is extended to a class of similar stochastic algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunzhe Hu, Difan Zou, Dong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models have achieved unprecedented success with a gigantic amount of parameters and computational resources. Yet, the core building blocks of these models, the Transformer layers, and how they are arranged and configured are primarily engineered from the bottom up and driven by heuristics. For advancing next-generation architectures, it demands exploring a prototypical model that is amenable to high interpretability and of practical competence. To this end, we take a step from the top-down view and design neural networks from an energy minimization perspective. Specifically, to promote isotropic token distribution on the sphere, we formulate a modified Hopfield energy function on the subspace-embedded hypersphere, based on which Transformer layers with symmetric structures are designed as the iterative optimization for the energy function. By integrating layers with the same parameters, we propose \textit{Hyper-Spherical Energy Transformer} (Hyper-SET), an alternative to the vanilla Transformer with recurrent depth. This design inherently provides greater interpretability and allows for scaling to deeper layers without a significant increase in the number of parameters. We also empirically demonstrate that Hyper-SET achieves comparable or even superior performance on both synthetic and real-world tasks, such as solving Sudoku and masked image modeling, while utilizing fewer parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Foster, Jakob Foerster</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> F\'abio Vital, Alberto Sardinha, Francisco S. Melo</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational repair is a mechanism used to detect and resolve miscommunication and misinformation problems when two or more agents interact. One particular and underexplored form of repair in emergent communication is the implicit repair mechanism, where the interlocutor purposely conveys the desired information in such a way as to prevent misinformation from any other interlocutor. This work explores how redundancy can modify the emergent communication protocol to continue conveying the necessary information to complete the underlying task, even with additional external environmental pressures such as noise. We focus on extending the signaling game, called the Lewis Game, by adding noise in the communication channel and inputs received by the agents. Our analysis shows that agents add redundancy to the transmitted messages as an outcome to prevent the negative impact of noise on the task success. Additionally, we observe that the emerging communication protocol's generalization capabilities remain equivalent to architectures employed in simpler games that are entirely deterministic. Additionally, our method is the only one suitable for producing robust communication protocols that can handle cases with and without noise while maintaining increased generalization performance levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sifan Zhou, Shuo Wang, Zhihang Yuan, Mingjia Shi, Yuzhang Shang, Dawei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning technologies have achieved remarkable results. However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to BF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage. Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Burak Gulhan, Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Murali Emani, Mahmut Kandemir, Venkatram Vishwanath</p>
<p>Abstract: In Large Language Model (LLM) inference, Key-Value (KV) caches (KV-caches) are essential for reducing time complexity. However, they result in a linear increase in GPU memory as the context length grows. While recent work explores KV-cache eviction and compression policies to reduce memory usage, they often consider uniform KV-caches across all attention heads, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce BaKlaVa, a method to allocate optimal memory for individual KV-caches across the model by estimating the importance of each KV-cache. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that not all KV-caches are equally critical for LLM performance. Using a one-time profiling approach, BaKlaVa assigns optimal memory budgets to each KV-cache. We evaluated our method on LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B models, achieving up to a 70\% compression ratio while keeping baseline performance and delivering up to an order-of-magnitude accuracy improvement at higher compression levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjun Pan, Yixin Liu, Xin Zheng, Yizhen Zheng, Alan Wee-Chung Liew, Fuyi Li, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph fraud detection (GFD) has rapidly advanced in protecting online services by identifying malicious fraudsters. Recent supervised GFD research highlights that heterophilic connections between fraudsters and users can greatly impact detection performance, since fraudsters tend to camouflage themselves by building more connections to benign users. Despite the promising performance of supervised GFD methods, the reliance on labels limits their applications to unsupervised scenarios; Additionally, accurately capturing complex and diverse heterophily patterns without labels poses a further challenge. To fill the gap, we propose a Heterophily-guided Unsupervised Graph fraud dEtection approach (HUGE) for unsupervised GFD, which contains two essential components: a heterophily estimation module and an alignment-based fraud detection module. In the heterophily estimation module, we design a novel label-free heterophily metric called HALO, which captures the critical graph properties for GFD, enabling its outstanding ability to estimate heterophily from node attributes. In the alignment-based fraud detection module, we develop a joint MLP-GNN architecture with ranking loss and asymmetric alignment loss. The ranking loss aligns the predicted fraud score with the relative order of HALO, providing an extra robustness guarantee by comparing heterophily among non-adjacent nodes. Moreover, the asymmetric alignment loss effectively utilizes structural information while alleviating the feature-smooth effects of GNNs. Extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate that HUGE significantly outperforms competitors, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding molecules is key to understanding organisms and driving advances in drug discovery, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge across chemistry and biology. Although large molecular language models have achieved notable success in interpreting molecular structures, their instruction datasets are limited to the specific knowledge from task-oriented datasets and do not fully cover the fundamental characteristics of molecules, hindering their abilities as general-purpose molecular assistants. To address this issue, we propose Mol-LLaMA, a large molecular language model that grasps the general knowledge centered on molecules via multi-modal instruction tuning. To this end, we design key data types that encompass the fundamental features of molecules, incorporating essential knowledge from molecular structures. In addition, to improve understanding of molecular features, we introduce a module that integrates complementary information from different molecular encoders, leveraging the distinct advantages of different molecular representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mol-LLaMA is capable of comprehending the general features of molecules and generating relevant responses to users' queries with detailed explanations, implying its potential as a general-purpose assistant for molecular analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damiano Paniccia, Francesco Aldo Tucci, Joel Guerrero, Luigi Capone, Nicoletta Sanguini, Tommaso Benacchio, Luigi Bottasso</p>
<p>Abstract: Rotorcraft engines are highly complex, nonlinear thermodynamic systems that operate under varying environmental and flight conditions. Simulating their dynamics is crucial for design, fault diagnostics, and deterioration control phases, and requires robust and reliable control systems to estimate engine performance throughout flight envelope. However, the development of detailed physical models of the engine based on numerical simulations is a very challenging task due to the complex and entangled physics driving the engine. In this scenario, data-driven machine-learning techniques are of great interest to the aircraft engine community, due to their ability to describe nonlinear systems' dynamic behavior and enable online performance estimation, achieving excellent results with accuracy competitive with the state of the art. In this work, we explore different Neural Network architectures to model the turboshaft engine of Leonardo's AW189P4 prototype, aiming to predict the engine torque. The models are trained on an extensive database of real flight tests featuring a variety of operational maneuvers performed under different flight conditions, providing a comprehensive representation of the engine's performance. To complement the neural network approach, we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to derive a low-dimensional dynamical model from the available data, describing the relationship between fuel flow and engine torque. The resulting model showcases SINDy's capability to recover the actual physics underlying the engine dynamics and demonstrates its potential for investigating more complex aspects of the engine. The results prove that data-driven engine models can exploit a wider range of parameters than standard transfer function-based approaches, enabling the use of trained schemes to simulate nonlinear effects in different engines and helicopters.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Llamba, a family of efficient recurrent language models distilled from Llama-3.x into the Mamba architecture. The series includes Llamba-1B, Llamba-3B, and Llamba-8B, which achieve higher inference throughput and handle significantly larger batch sizes than Transformer-based models while maintaining comparable benchmark performance. Furthermore, Llamba demonstrates the effectiveness of cross-architecture distillation using MOHAWK (Bick et al., 2024), achieving these results with less than 0.1% of the training data typically used for models of similar size. To take full advantage of their efficiency, we provide an optimized implementation of Llamba for resource-constrained devices such as smartphones and edge platforms, offering a practical and memory-efficient alternative to Transformers. Overall, Llamba improves the tradeoff between speed, memory efficiency, and performance, making high-quality language models more accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xun Deng, Han Zhong, Rui Ai, Fuli Feng, Zheng Wang, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. While prior work mainly extends DPO from the aspect of the objective function, we instead improve DPO from the largely overlooked but critical aspect of data selection. Specifically, we address the issue of parameter shrinkage caused by noisy data by proposing a novel margin-maximization principle for dataset curation in DPO training. To accurately estimate margins for data selection, we propose a dual-margin guided approach that considers both external reward margins and implicit DPO reward margins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method reduces computational cost dramatically while improving performance. Remarkably, by using just 10\% of the Ultrafeedback dataset, our approach achieves 3\% to 8\% improvements across various Llama and Mistral series models on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends to iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\% improvement with 25\% online data, while further reducing training time. These results highlight the potential of data selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Margarida M. Campos, Jo\~ao Cal\'em, Sophia Sklaviadis, M\'ario A. T. Figueiredo, Andr\'e F. T. Martins</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification that replaces point predictions with sets, offering marginal coverage guarantees (i.e., ensuring that the prediction sets contain the true label with a specified probability, in expectation). In this paper, we uncover a novel connection between conformal prediction and sparse softmax-like transformations, such as sparsemax and $\gamma$-entmax (with $\gamma > 1$), which may assign nonzero probability only to a subset of labels. We introduce new non-conformity scores for classification that make the calibration process correspond to the widely used temperature scaling method. At test time, applying these sparse transformations with the calibrated temperature leads to a support set (i.e., the set of labels with nonzero probability) that automatically inherits the coverage guarantees of conformal prediction. Through experiments on computer vision and text classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results in terms of coverage, efficiency, and adaptiveness compared to standard non-conformity scores based on softmax.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuoya Xiong, Aarti Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used fine-tuning approach that aligns machine learning model, particularly Language Model (LM) with human preferences. There are typically multiple objectives driving the preference, hence humans find it easier to express per-objective comparisons rather than a global preference between two choices. Multi-Objective RLHF (MORLHF) aims to use per-objective preference feedback and achieve Pareto optimality among these objectives by aggregating them into a single unified objective for optimization. However, nearly all prior works rely on linear aggregation, which rules out policies that favor specific objectives such as the worst one. The only existing approach using non-linear aggregation is computationally expensive due to its reward-based nature and the need for retraining whenever the aggregation parameters change. In this work, we address this limitation by transforming the non-linear aggregation maximization problem into a series of sub-problems. Each sub-problem involves only linear aggregation, making it computationally efficient to solve. We further extend our framework to handle multi-group scenarios, where each group has distinct weights for the objectives. Our method enables achieving consensus or maximizing the aggregated objective across all groups. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our algorithmic framework achieves sublinear regret and can be easily adapted to a reward-free algorithm. Empirically, leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose a nearly training-free algorithm once the optimal policies for individual objectives are obtained.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators, understanding their ability to effectively compare data pairs as instructed in the prompt becomes essential. To address this, we present PairBench, a low-cost framework that systematically evaluates VLMs as customizable similarity tools across various modalities and scenarios. Through PairBench, we introduce four metrics that represent key desiderata of similarity scores: alignment with human annotations, consistency for data pairs irrespective of their order, smoothness of similarity distributions, and controllability through prompting. Our analysis demonstrates that no model, whether closed- or open-source, is superior on all metrics; the optimal choice depends on an auto evaluator's desired behavior (e.g., a smooth vs. a sharp judge), highlighting risks of widespread adoption of VLMs as evaluators without thorough assessment. For instance, the majority of VLMs struggle with maintaining symmetric similarity scores regardless of order. Additionally, our results show that the performance of VLMs on the metrics in PairBench closely correlates with popular benchmarks, showcasing its predictive power in ranking models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kernel matrix-vector multiplication (KMVM) is a foundational operation in machine learning and scientific computing. However, as KMVM tends to scale quadratically in both memory and time, applications are often limited by these computational constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel approximation procedure coined \textit{Faster-Fast and Free Memory Method} ($\fthreem$) to address these scaling issues of KMVM for tall~($10^8\sim 10^9$) and skinny~($D\leq7$) data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\fthreem$ has empirical \emph{linear time and memory} complexity with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$ and can compute a full KMVM for a billion points \emph{in under a minute} on a high-end GPU, leading to a significant speed-up in comparison to existing CPU methods. We demonstrate the utility of our procedure by applying it as a drop-in for the state-of-the-art GPU-based linear solver FALKON, \emph{improving speed 1.5-5.5 times} at the cost of $<1\%$ drop in accuracy. We further demonstrate competitive results on \emph{Gaussian Process regression} coupled with significant speedups on a variety of real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods of artificial intelligence (AI) and especially machine learning (ML) have been growing ever more complex, and at the same time have more and more impact on people's lives. This leads to explainable AI (XAI) manifesting itself as an important research field that helps humans to better comprehend ML systems. In parallel, quantum machine learning (QML) is emerging with the ongoing improvement of quantum computing hardware combined with its increasing availability via cloud services. QML enables quantum-enhanced ML in which quantum mechanics is exploited to facilitate ML tasks, typically in the form of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical resources. Quantum gates constitute the building blocks of gate-based quantum hardware and form circuits that can be used for quantum computations. For QML applications, quantum circuits are typically parameterized and their parameters are optimized classically such that a suitably defined objective function is minimized. Inspired by XAI, we raise the question of the explainability of such circuits by quantifying the importance of (groups of) gates for specific goals. To this end, we apply the well-established concept of Shapley values. The resulting attributions can be interpreted as explanations for why a specific circuit works well for a given task, improving the understanding of how to construct parameterized (or variational) quantum circuits, and fostering their human interpretability in general. An experimental evaluation on simulators and two superconducting quantum hardware devices demonstrates the benefits of the proposed framework for classification, generative modeling, transpilation, and optimization. Furthermore, our results shed some light on the role of specific gates in popular QML approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that has been used in many fields, such as robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems. There has been growing interest in using RL for quantitative trading, where the goal is to make trades that generate profits in financial markets. This paper presents the use of RL for quantitative trading and reports a case study based on an RL-based trading algorithm. The results show that RL can be a useful tool for quantitative trading and can perform better than traditional trading algorithms. The use of reinforcement learning for quantitative trading is a promising area of research that can help develop more sophisticated and efficient trading systems. Future research can explore the use of other reinforcement learning techniques, the use of other data sources, and the testing of the system on a range of asset classes. Together, our work shows the potential in the use of reinforcement learning for quantitative trading and the need for further research and development in this area. By developing the sophistication and efficiency of trading systems, it may be possible to make financial markets more efficient and generate higher returns for investors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Chen, Zhehao Li, Xiaojie Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of classification with selectively labeled data, whose distribution may differ from the full population due to historical decision-making. We exploit the fact that in many applications historical decisions were made by multiple decision-makers, each with different decision rules. We analyze this setup under a principled instrumental variable (IV) framework and rigorously study the identification of classification risk. We establish conditions for the exact identification of classification risk and derive tight partial identification bounds when exact identification fails. We further propose a unified cost-sensitive learning (UCL) approach to learn classifiers robust to selection bias in both identification settings. We further theoretically and numerically validate the efficacy of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghanshyam Verma, Shovon Sengupta, Simon Simanta, Huan Chen, Janos A. Perge, Devishree Pillai, John P. McCrae, Paul Buitelaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized recommender systems play a crucial role in direct marketing, particularly in financial services, where delivering relevant content can enhance customer engagement and promote informed decision-making. This study explores interpretable knowledge graph (KG)-based recommender systems by proposing two distinct approaches for personalized article recommendations within a multinational financial services firm. The first approach leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to traverse a KG constructed from both structured (tabular) and unstructured (textual) data, enabling interpretability through Path Directed Reasoning (PDR). The second approach employs the XGBoost algorithm, with post-hoc explainability techniques such as SHAP and ELI5 to enhance transparency. By integrating machine learning with automatically generated KGs, our methods not only improve recommendation accuracy but also provide interpretable insights, facilitating more informed decision-making in customer relationship management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Christian Nauen, Sebastian Palacio, Federico Raue, Andreas Dengel</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-attention in Transformers comes with a high computational cost because of their quadratic computational complexity, but their effectiveness in addressing problems in language and vision has sparked extensive research aimed at enhancing their efficiency. However, diverse experimental conditions, spanning multiple input domains, prevent a fair comparison based solely on reported results, posing challenges for model selection. To address this gap in comparability, we perform a large-scale benchmark of more than 45 models for image classification, evaluating key efficiency aspects, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage. Our benchmark provides a standardized baseline for efficiency-oriented transformers. We analyze the results based on the Pareto front -- the boundary of optimal models. Surprisingly, despite claims of other models being more efficient, ViT remains Pareto optimal across multiple metrics. We observe that hybrid attention-CNN models exhibit remarkable inference memory- and parameter-efficiency. Moreover, our benchmark shows that using a larger model in general is more efficient than using higher resolution images. Thanks to our holistic evaluation, we provide a centralized resource for practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting or developing efficient transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Ye, Zaixiang Zheng, Yu Bao, Lihua Qian, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge of generative AI has been fueled by the generative power of diffusion probabilistic models and the scalable capabilities of large language models. Despite their potential, it remains elusive whether diffusion language models can solve general language tasks comparable to their autoregressive counterparts. This paper demonstrates that scaling diffusion models w.r.t. data, sizes, and tasks can effectively make them strong language learners. We build competent diffusion language models at scale by first acquiring knowledge from massive data via masked language modeling pretraining thanks to their intrinsic connections. We then reprogram pretrained masked language models into diffusion language models via diffusive adaptation, wherein task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored to unlock their versatility in solving general language tasks. Experiments show that scaling diffusion language models consistently improves performance across downstream language tasks. We further discover that instruction finetuning can elicit zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning abilities that help tackle many unseen tasks by following natural language instructions, and show promise in advanced and challenging abilities such as reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khayrul Islam, Ratul Paul, Shen Wang, Yuwen Zhao, Partho Adhikary, Qiying Li, Xiaochen Qin, Yaling Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Label-free cell classification is advantageous for supplying pristine cells for further use or examination, yet existing techniques frequently fall short in terms of specificity and speed. In this study, we address these limitations through the development of a novel machine learning framework, Multiplex Image Machine Learning (MIML). This architecture uniquely combines label-free cell images with biomechanical property data, harnessing the vast, often underutilized morphological information intrinsic to each cell. By integrating both types of data, our model offers a more holistic understanding of the cellular properties, utilizing morphological information typically discarded in traditional machine learning models. This approach has led to a remarkable 98.3\% accuracy in cell classification, a substantial improvement over models that only consider a single data type. MIML has been proven effective in classifying white blood cells and tumor cells, with potential for broader application due to its inherent flexibility and transfer learning capability. It's particularly effective for cells with similar morphology but distinct biomechanical properties. This innovative approach has significant implications across various fields, from advancing disease diagnostics to understanding cellular behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Zheng, Haowei Lin, Kaichen He, Zihao Wang, Zilong Zheng, Yitao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengyin Sun, Yuxiang Ren, Jiehao Chen, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binh M. Le, Jiwon Kim, Shahroz Tariq, Kristen Moore, Alsharif Abuadbba, Simon S. Woo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deepfakes have rapidly emerged as a profound and serious threat to society, primarily due to their ease of creation and dissemination. This situation has triggered an accelerated development of deepfake detection technologies. However, many existing detectors rely heavily on lab-generated datasets for validation, which may not effectively prepare them for novel, emerging, and real-world deepfake techniques. In this paper, we conduct an extensive and comprehensive review and analysis of the latest state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, evaluating them against several critical criteria. These criteria facilitate the categorization of these detectors into 4 high-level groups and 13 fine-grained sub-groups, all aligned with a unified standard conceptual framework. This classification and framework offer deep and practical insights into the factors that affect detector efficacy. We assess the generalizability of 16 leading detectors across various standard attack scenarios, including black-box, white-box, and gray-box settings. Our systematized analysis and experimentation lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of deepfake detectors and their generalizability, paving the way for future research focused on creating detectors adept at countering various attack scenarios. Additionally, this work offers insights for developing more proactive defenses against deepfakes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wesley H. Holliday, Alexander Kristoffersen, Eric Pacuit</p>
<p>Abstract: By classic results in social choice theory, any reasonable preferential voting method sometimes gives individuals an incentive to report an insincere preference. The extent to which different voting methods are more or less resistant to such strategic manipulation has become a key consideration for comparing voting methods. Here we measure resistance to manipulation by whether neural networks of various sizes can learn to profitably manipulate a given voting method in expectation, given different types of limited information about how other voters will vote. We trained over 100,000 neural networks of 26 sizes to manipulate against 8 different voting methods, under 6 types of limited information, in committee-sized elections with 5-21 voters and 3-6 candidates. We find that some voting methods, such as Borda, are highly manipulable by networks with limited information, while others, such as Instant Runoff, are not, despite being quite profitably manipulated by an ideal manipulator with full information. For the three probability models for elections that we use, the overall least manipulable of the 8 methods we study are Condorcet methods, namely Minimax and Split Cycle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusu Hong, Junhong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The Adaptive Momentum Estimation (Adam) algorithm is highly effective in training various deep learning tasks. Despite this, there's limited theoretical understanding for Adam, especially when focusing on its vanilla form in non-convex smooth scenarios with potential unbounded gradients and affine variance noise. In this paper, we study vanilla Adam under these challenging conditions. We introduce a comprehensive noise model which governs affine variance noise, bounded noise and sub-Gaussian noise. We show that Adam can find a stationary point with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log T)/\sqrt{T})$ rate in high probability under this general noise model where $T$ denotes total number iterations, matching the lower rate of stochastic first-order algorithms up to logarithm factors. More importantly, we reveal that Adam is free of tuning step-sizes with any problem-parameters, yielding a better adaptation property than the Stochastic Gradient Descent under the same conditions. We also provide a probabilistic convergence result for Adam under a generalized smooth condition which allows unbounded smoothness parameters and has been illustrated empirically to more accurately capture the smooth property of many practical objective functions.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02968">Hamiltonian Property Testing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andreas Bluhm, Matthias C. Caro, Aadil Oufkir</p>
<p>Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Zhu, Shuofei Qiao, Yixin Ou, Shumin Deng, Shiwei Lyu, Yue Shen, Lei Liang, Jinjie Gu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew R. Ziemann, Christopher A. Metzler</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a learning-based method for adaptively generating low probability of detection (LPD) radar waveforms that blend into their operating environment. Our waveforms are designed to follow a distribution that is indistinguishable from the ambient radio frequency (RF) background -- while still being effective at ranging and sensing. To do so, we use an unsupervised, adversarial learning framework; our generator network produces waveforms designed to confuse a critic network, which is optimized to differentiate generated waveforms from the background. To ensure our generated waveforms are still effective for sensing, we introduce and minimize an ambiguity function-based loss on the generated waveforms. We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing the single-pulse detectability of our generated waveforms with traditional LPD waveforms using a separately trained detection neural network. We find that our method can generate LPD waveforms that reduce detectability by up to 90% while simultaneously offering improved ambiguity function (sensing) characteristics. Our framework also provides a mechanism to trade-off detectability and sensing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyuan Gao, Qizhi Pei, Gongbo Zhang, Jinhua Zhu, Kun He, Lijun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular docking is a pivotal process in drug discovery. While traditional techniques rely on extensive sampling and simulation governed by physical principles, these methods are often slow and costly. The advent of deep learning-based approaches has shown significant promise, offering increases in both accuracy and efficiency. Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a model designed with a focus on speed and accuracy, we present FABind+, an enhanced iteration that largely boosts the performance of its predecessor. We identify pocket prediction as a critical bottleneck in molecular docking and propose a novel methodology that significantly refines pocket prediction, thereby streamlining the docking process. Furthermore, we introduce modifications to the docking module to enhance its pose generation capabilities. In an effort to bridge the gap with conventional sampling/generative methods, we incorporate a simple yet effective sampling technique coupled with a confidence model, requiring only minor adjustments to the regression framework of FABind. Experimental results and analysis reveal that FABind+ remarkably outperforms the original FABind, achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance, and delivers insightful modeling strategies. This demonstrates FABind+ represents a substantial step forward in molecular docking and drug discovery. Our code is in https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ingo Steinwart</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the conditional distributions of two Banach space valued, jointly Gaussian random variables. In particular, we show that these conditional distributions are again Gaussian and that their means and covariances can be determined by a general finite dimensional approximation scheme. Here, it turns out that the covariance operators occurring in this scheme converge with respect to the nuclear norm and that the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Furthermore, we discuss how our approximation scheme can be implemented in several classes of important Banach spaces such as (reproducing kernel) Hilbert spaces, spaces of continuous functions, and other spaces consisting of functions. As an example, we then apply our general results to the case of continuous Gaussian processes that are conditioned to partial but infinite observations of their paths. Here we show that conditioning on sufficiently rich, increasing sets of finitely many observations leads to consistent approximations, that is, both the mean and covariance functions converge uniformly and the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Moreover, we discuss how these results improve our understanding of the popular Gaussian processes for machine learning. From a technical perspective our results are based upon a Banach space valued martingale approach for regular conditional probabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Light curves serve as a valuable source of information on stellar formation and evolution. With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems primarily focus on the vehicle directly ahead, often overlooking potential risks from following vehicles. This oversight can lead to ineffective handling of high risk situations, such as high speed, closely spaced, multi vehicle scenarios where emergency braking by one vehicle might trigger a pile up collision. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning based algorithm for longitudinal control and collision avoidance. This proposed algorithm effectively considers the behavior of both leading and following vehicles. Its implementation in simulated high risk scenarios, which involve emergency braking in dense traffic where traditional systems typically fail, has demonstrated the algorithm ability to prevent potential pile up collisions, including those involving heavy duty vehicles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Numerous works propose post-hoc, model-agnostic explanations for learning to rank, focusing on ordering entities by their relevance to a query through feature attribution methods. However, these attributions often weakly correlate or contradict each other, confusing end users. We adopt an axiomatic game-theoretic approach, popular in the feature attribution community, to identify a set of fundamental axioms that every ranking-based feature attribution method should satisfy. We then introduce Rank-SHAP, extending classical Shapley values to ranking. We evaluate the RankSHAP framework through extensive experiments on two datasets, multiple ranking methods and evaluation metrics. Additionally, a user study confirms RankSHAP's alignment with human intuition. We also perform an axiomatic analysis of existing rank attribution algorithms to determine their compliance with our proposed axioms. Ultimately, our aim is to equip practitioners with a set of axiomatically backed feature attribution methods for studying IR ranking models, that ensure generality as well as consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Tu, Nikolas Kantas, Robert M. Lee, Behrang Shafei</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust optimisation is a well-established framework for optimising functions in the presence of uncertainty. The inherent goal of this problem is to identify a collection of inputs whose outputs are both desirable for the decision maker, whilst also being robust to the underlying uncertainties in the problem. In this work, we study the multi-objective case of this problem. We identify that the majority of all robust multi-objective algorithms rely on two key operations: robustification and scalarisation. Robustification refers to the strategy that is used to account for the uncertainty in the problem. Scalarisation refers to the procedure that is used to encode the relative importance of each objective to a scalar-valued reward. As these operations are not necessarily commutative, the order that they are performed in has an impact on the resulting solutions that are identified and the final decisions that are made. The purpose of this work is to give a thorough exposition on the effects of these different orderings and in particular highlight when one should opt for one ordering over the other. As part of our analysis, we showcase how many existing risk concepts can be integrated into the specification and solution of a robust multi-objective optimisation problem. Besides this, we also demonstrate how one can principally define the notion of a robust Pareto front and a robust performance metric based on our ``robustify and scalarise'' methodology. To illustrate the efficacy of these new ideas, we present two insightful case studies which are based on real-world data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Ji, Yang Xiang, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Zi Ye, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven advances in natural language processing. Still, their growing scale has increased the computational burden, necessitating a balance between efficiency and performance. Low-rank compression, a promising technique, reduces non-essential parameters by decomposing weight matrices into products of two low-rank matrices. Yet, its application in LLMs has not been extensively studied. The key to low-rank compression lies in low-rank factorization and low-rank dimensions allocation. To address the challenges of low-rank compression in LLMs, we conduct empirical research on the low-rank characteristics of large models. We propose a low-rank compression method suitable for LLMs. This approach involves precise estimation of feature distributions through pooled covariance matrices and a Bayesian optimization strategy for allocating low-rank dimensions. Experiments on the LLaMA-2 models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong structured pruning and low-rank compression techniques in maintaining model performance at the same compression ratio.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhiraj Neupane, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Richard Dazeley, Sunil Aryal</p>
<p>Abstract: In this era of advanced manufacturing, it's now more crucial than ever to diagnose machine faults as early as possible to guarantee their safe and efficient operation. With the massive surge in industrial big data and advancement in sensing and computational technologies, data-driven Machinery Fault Diagnosis (MFD) solutions based on machine/deep learning approaches have been used ubiquitously in manufacturing. Timely and accurately identifying faulty machine signals is vital in industrial applications for which many relevant solutions have been proposed and are reviewed in many articles. Despite the availability of numerous solutions and reviews on MFD, existing works often lack several aspects. Most of the available literature has limited applicability in a wide range of manufacturing settings due to their concentration on a particular type of equipment or method of analysis. Additionally, discussions regarding the challenges associated with implementing data-driven approaches, such as dealing with noisy data, selecting appropriate features, and adapting models to accommodate new or unforeseen faults, are often superficial or completely overlooked. Thus, this survey provides a comprehensive review of the articles using different types of machine learning approaches for the detection and diagnosis of various types of machinery faults, highlights their strengths and limitations, provides a review of the methods used for condition-based analyses, comprehensively discusses the available machinery fault datasets, introduces future researchers to the possible challenges they have to encounter while using these approaches for MFD and recommends the probable solutions to mitigate those problems. The future research prospects are also pointed out for a better understanding of the field. We believe this article will help researchers and contribute to the further development of the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonin Schrab, Ilmun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a general method for constructing robust permutation tests under data corruption. The proposed tests effectively control the non-asymptotic type I error under data corruption, and we prove their consistency in power under minimal conditions. This contributes to the practical deployment of hypothesis tests for real-world applications with potential adversarial attacks. For the two-sample and independence settings, we show that our kernel robust tests are minimax optimal, in the sense that they are guaranteed to be non-asymptotically powerful against alternatives uniformly separated from the null in the kernel MMD and HSIC metrics at some optimal rate (tight with matching lower bound). We point out that existing differentially private tests can be adapted to be robust to data corruption, and we demonstrate in experiments that our proposed tests achieve much higher power than these private tests. Finally, we provide publicly available implementations and empirically illustrate the practicality of our robust tests.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roberto Ceraolo, Dmitrii Kharlapenko, Ahmad Khan, Am\'elie Reymond, Rada Mihalcea, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, Mrinmaya Sachan, Zhijing Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) technology has changed our role in interacting with these models. Instead of primarily testing these models with questions we already know answers to, we are now using them for queries where the answers are unknown to us, driven by human curiosity. This shift highlights the growing need to understand curiosity-driven human questions - those that are more complex, open-ended, and reflective of real-world needs. To this end, we present Quriosity, a collection of 13.5K naturally occurring questions from three diverse sources: human-to-search-engine queries, human-to-human interactions, and human-to-LLM conversations. Our comprehensive collection enables a rich understanding of human curiosity across various domains and contexts. Our analysis reveals a significant presence of causal questions (up to 42%) in the dataset, for which we develop an iterative prompt improvement framework to identify all causal queries and examine their unique linguistic properties, cognitive complexity and source distribution. Our paper paves the way for future work on causal question identification and open-ended chatbot interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thibaud Gloaguen, Nikola Jovanovi\'c, Robin Staab, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising way to detect LLM-generated text, by augmenting LLM generations with later detectable signals. Recent work has proposed multiple families of watermarking schemes, several of which focus on preserving the LLM distribution. This distribution-preservation property is motivated by the fact that it is a tractable proxy for retaining LLM capabilities, as well as the inherently implied undetectability of the watermark by downstream users. Yet, despite much discourse around undetectability, no prior work has investigated the practical detectability of any of the current watermarking schemes in a realistic black-box setting. In this work we tackle this for the first time, developing rigorous statistical tests to detect the presence, and estimate parameters, of all three popular watermarking scheme families, using only a limited number of black-box queries. We experimentally confirm the effectiveness of our methods on a range of schemes and a diverse set of open-source models. Further, we validate the feasibility of our tests on real-world APIs. Our findings indicate that current watermarking schemes are more detectable than previously believed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hoang-Quan Nguyen, Xuan Bac Nguyen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Hugh Churchill, Nicholas Borys, Samee U. Khan, Khoa Luu</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) have been acknowledged as a leading strategy to utilize near-term quantum advantages in multiple problems, including machine learning and combinatorial optimization. When applied to specific tasks, the parameters in the quantum circuits are trained to minimize the target function. Although there have been comprehensive studies to improve the performance of the PQCs on practical tasks, the errors caused by the quantum noise downgrade the performance when running on real quantum computers. In particular, when the quantum state is transformed through multiple quantum circuit layers, the effect of the quantum noise happens cumulatively and becomes closer to the maximally mixed state or complete noise. This paper studies the relationship between the quantum noise and the diffusion model. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired learning approach to mitigate the quantum noise in the PQCs and reduce the error for specific tasks. Through our experiments, we illustrate the efficiency of the learning strategy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification tasks in the quantum noise scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Yonetani</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents TSPDiffuser, a novel data-driven path planner for traveling salesperson path planning problems (TSPPPs) in environments rich with obstacles. Given a set of destinations within obstacle maps, our objective is to efficiently find the shortest possible collision-free path that visits all the destinations. In TSPDiffuser, we train a diffusion model on a large collection of TSPPP instances and their respective solutions to generate plausible paths for unseen problem instances. The model can then be employed as a learned sampler to construct a roadmap that contains potential solutions with a small number of nodes and edges. This approach enables efficient and accurate estimation of travel costs between destinations, effectively addressing the primary computational challenge in solving TSPPPs. Experimental evaluations with diverse synthetic and real-world indoor/outdoor environments demonstrate the effectiveness of TSPDiffuser over existing methods in terms of the trade-off between solution quality and computational time requirements.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper shifts focus to the often-overlooked input embeddings - the initial representations fed into transformer blocks. Using fuzzy graph, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and community detection, we analyze embeddings from diverse LLMs, finding significant categorical community structure aligned with predefined concepts and categories aligned with humans. We observe these groupings exhibit within-cluster organization (such as hierarchies, topological ordering, etc.), hypothesizing a fundamental structure that precedes contextual processing. To further investigate the conceptual nature of these groupings, we explore cross-model alignments across different LLM categories within their input embeddings, observing a medium to high degree of alignment. Furthermore, provide evidence that manipulating these groupings can play a functional role in mitigating ethnicity bias in LLM tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Shi, Mengqi Yuan, Junkang Wu, Qifan Wang, Fuli Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for agent tasks is critical in developing language agents. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising technique for this adaptation with the alleviation of compounding errors, offering a means to directly optimize Reinforcement Learning (RL) objectives. However, applying DPO to multi-turn tasks presents challenges due to the inability to cancel the partition function. Overcoming this obstacle involves making the partition function independent of the current state and addressing length disparities between preferred and dis-preferred trajectories. In this light, we replace the policy constraint with the state-action occupancy measure constraint in the RL objective and add length normalization to the Bradley-Terry model, yielding a novel loss function named DMPO for multi-turn agent tasks with theoretical explanations. Extensive experiments on three multi-turn agent task datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the DMPO loss. The code is available at https://github.com/swt-user/DMPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Wang, Peng Wang, Tong Zhou, Yushun Dong, Zhen Tan, Jundong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to handle various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, concerns regarding the potential negative societal impacts of LLM-generated content have also arisen. To evaluate the biases exhibited by LLMs, researchers have recently proposed a variety of datasets. However, existing bias evaluation efforts often focus on only a particular type of bias and employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, leading to difficulties in comparison across different datasets and LLMs. To address these limitations, we collect a variety of datasets designed for the bias evaluation of LLMs, and further propose CEB, a Compositional Evaluation Benchmark that covers different types of bias across different social groups and tasks. The curation of CEB is based on our newly proposed compositional taxonomy, which characterizes each dataset from three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks. By combining the three dimensions, we develop a comprehensive evaluation strategy for the bias in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that the levels of bias vary across these dimensions, thereby providing guidance for the development of specific bias mitigation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuqiang Wang, Tong Zhou, Yanyan Shen, Ye Li, Guoheng Huang, Yong Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p>

However, existing point cloud upsampling inputs are all patch based, and there is no research discussing the differences and principles between point cloud model full input and patch based input. In order to compare with patch based point cloud input, this article proposes a new data input method, which divides the full point cloud model to ensure shape integrity while training PU-GCN. This article was validated on the PU1K and ABC datasets, but the results showed that Patch based performance is better than model based full input i.e. Average Segment input. Therefore, this article explores the data input factors and model modules that affect the upsampling results of point clouds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Wei, Haodong Feng, Yuchen Yang, Ruiqi Feng, Peiyan Hu, Xiang Zheng, Tao Zhang, Dixia Fan, Tailin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The control problems of complex physical systems have broad applications in science and engineering. Previous studies have shown that generative control methods based on diffusion models offer significant advantages for solving these problems. However, existing generative control approaches face challenges in both performance and efficiency when extended to the closed-loop setting, which is essential for effective control. In this paper, we propose an efficient Closed-Loop Diffusion method for Physical systems Control (CL-DiffPhyCon). By employing an asynchronous denoising framework for different physical time steps, CL-DiffPhyCon generates control signals conditioned on real-time feedback from the system with significantly reduced computational cost during sampling. Additionally, the control process could be further accelerated by incorporating fast sampling techniques, such as DDIM. We evaluate CL-DiffPhyCon on two tasks: 1D Burgers' equation control and 2D incompressible fluid control. The results demonstrate that CL-DiffPhyCon achieves superior control performance with significant improvements in sampling efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yorick Sens, Henriette Knopp, Sven Peldszus, Thorsten Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of machine learning (ML) and its integration into software systems has drastically changed development practices. While software engineering traditionally focused on manually created code artifacts with dedicated processes and architectures, ML-enabled systems require additional data-science methods and tools to create ML artifacts -- especially ML models and training data. However, integrating models into systems, and managing the many different artifacts involved, is far from trivial. ML-enabled systems can easily have multiple ML models that interact with each other and with traditional code in intricate ways. Unfortunately, while challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systems have been studied, little is known about the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems beyond isolated examples. Improving engineering processes and architectures for ML-enabled systems requires improving the empirical understanding of these systems. We present a large-scale study of 2,928 open-source ML-enabled software systems. We classified and analyzed them to determine system characteristics, model and code reuse practices, and architectural aspects of integrating ML models. Our findings show that these systems still mainly consist of traditional source code, and that ML model reuse through code duplication or pre-trained models is common. We also identified different ML integration patterns and related implementation practices. We hope that our results help improve practices for integrating ML models, bringing data science and software engineering closer together.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongliang Guo, Chun Tong Lei, Lei Fang, Shuai Zhao, Yifei Qian, Jingyu Lin, Zeyu Wang, Cunjian Chen, Ognjen Arandjelovi\'c, Chun Pong Lau</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), have revolutionized image synthesis and manipulation. However, these generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and intellectual property infringement. Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying misuse of generative AI. Current approaches to safeguarding images from manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated images. In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse during training. Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific knowledge. By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures. Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM. Our method outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.</p>

The upper- and lower-level problems might involve integer restrictions and disjunctive constraints. In a range of results, we invoke at most pointwise and local calmness for the lower-level problem in a sense that holds broadly. The lifted formulation is computationally attractive with structural properties being brought out and an outer approximation algorithm becoming available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chinese, as a linguistic system rich in depth and complexity, is characterized by distinctive elements such as ancient poetry, proverbs, idioms, and other cultural constructs. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroyasu Inoue, Yasuyuki Todo</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines how positive and negative news about firms affects their stock prices and, moreover, how it affects stock prices of the firms' suppliers and clients, using a large sample of publicly listed firms around the world and another of Japanese listed firms. The level of positiveness and negativeness of each news article is determined by FinBERT, a natural language processing model fine-tuned specifically for financial information. Supply chains of firms across the world are identified mostly by financial statements, while those of Japanese firms are taken from large-scale firm-level surveys. We find that positive news increases the change rate of stock prices of firms mentioned in the news before its disclosure, most likely because of diffusion of information through unofficial information channels. Positive news also raises stock prices of the firms' suppliers and clients before and after its disclosure, confirming propagation of market values through supply chains. In addition, we generally find a larger post-news effect on stock prices of the mentioned firms and their suppliers and clients than the pre-news effect. The positive difference between the post- and pre-news effects can be considered as the net effect of the disclosure of positive news, controlling for information diffusion through private channels. However, the post-news effect on suppliers and clients in Japan is smaller than the pre-news effect, which is the opposite result to non-domestic firms from around the world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiyi Zhu, Matteo Zecchin, Sangwoo Park, Caili Guo, Chunyan Feng, Petar Popovski, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Johannes Hertrich, Tim Jahn, Michael Quellmalz</p>
<p>Abstract: The fast computation of large kernel sums is a challenging task, which arises as a subproblem in any kernel method. We approach the problem by slicing, which relies on random projections to one-dimensional subspaces and fast Fourier summation. We prove bounds for the slicing error and propose a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approach for selecting the projections based on spherical quadrature rules. Numerical examples demonstrate that our QMC-slicing approach significantly outperforms existing methods like (QMC-)random Fourier features, orthogonal Fourier features or non-QMC slicing on standard test datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seanie Lee, Haebin Seong, Dong Bok Lee, Minki Kang, Xiaoyin Chen, Dominik Wagner, Yoshua Bengio, Juho Lee, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety guard models that detect malicious queries aimed at large language models (LLMs) are essential for ensuring the secure and responsible deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. However, deploying existing safety guard models with billions of parameters alongside LLMs on mobile devices is impractical due to substantial memory requirements and latency. To reduce this cost, we distill a large teacher safety guard model into a smaller one using a labeled dataset of instruction-response pairs with binary harmfulness labels. Due to the limited diversity of harmful instructions in the existing labeled dataset, naively distilled models tend to underperform compared to larger models. To bridge the gap between small and large models, we propose HarmAug, a simple yet effective data augmentation method that involves jailbreaking an LLM and prompting it to generate harmful instructions. Given a prompt such as, "Make a single harmful instruction prompt that would elicit offensive content", we add an affirmative prefix (e.g., "I have an idea for a prompt:") to the LLM's response. This encourages the LLM to continue generating the rest of the response, leading to sampling harmful instructions. Another LLM generates a response to the harmful instruction, and the teacher model labels the instruction-response pair. We empirically show that our HarmAug outperforms other relevant baselines. Moreover, a 435-million-parameter safety guard model trained with HarmAug achieves an F1 score comparable to larger models with over 7 billion parameters, and even outperforms them in AUPRC, while operating at less than 25% of their computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuofei Qiao, Runnan Fang, Zhisong Qiu, Xiaobin Wang, Ningyu Zhang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorfBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorfEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Hosseini Chagahi, Niloufar Delfan, Saeed Mohammadi Dashtaki, Behzad Moshiri, Md. Jalil Piran</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce and the widespread use of credit cards in online purchases and financial transactions have significantly heightened the importance of promptly and accurately detecting credit card fraud (CCF). Not only do fraudulent activities in financial transactions lead to substantial monetary losses for banks and financial institutions, but they also undermine user trust in digital services. This study presents a new stacking-based approach for CCF detection by adding two extra layers to the usual classification process: an attention layer and a confidence-based combination layer. In the attention layer, we combine soft outputs from a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the dependent ordered weighted averaging (DOWA) operator, and from a graph neural network (GNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network using the induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator. These weighted outputs capture different predictive signals, increasing the model's accuracy. Next, in the confidence-based layer, we select whichever aggregate (DOWA or IOWA) shows lower uncertainty to feed into a meta-learner. To make the model more explainable, we use shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to identify the top ten most important features for distinguishing between fraud and normal transactions. These features are then used in our attention-based model. Experiments on three datasets show that our method achieves high accuracy and robust generalization, making it effective for CCF detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongfu Liu, Hengguan Huang, Xiangming Gu, Hao Wang, Ye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for generating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation. We also advocate for incorporating reliability evaluation of confidence calibration when releasing future LLM-based guard models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Wang, Xiang Chen, Ningyu Zhang, Bozhong Tian, Haoming Xu, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs DeCo, which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhong Zhou, Haiyang Yu, Xinghua Zhang, Rongwu Xu, Fei Huang, Kun Wang, Yang Liu, Junfeng Fang, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple language tasks, yet their safety guardrails can be circumvented, leading to harmful generations. In light of this, recent research on safety mechanisms has emerged, revealing that when safety representations or component are suppressed, the safety capability of LLMs are compromised. However, existing research tends to overlook the safety impact of multi-head attention mechanisms, despite their crucial role in various model functionalities. Hence, in this paper, we aim to explore the connection between standard attention mechanisms and safety capability to fill this gap in the safety-related mechanistic interpretability. We propose a novel metric which tailored for multi-head attention, the Safety Head ImPortant Score (Ships), to assess the individual heads' contributions to model safety. Based on this, we generalize Ships to the dataset level and further introduce the Safety Attention Head AttRibution Algorithm (Sahara) to attribute the critical safety attention heads inside the model. Our findings show that the special attention head has a significant impact on safety. Ablating a single safety head allows aligned model (e.g., Llama-2-7b-chat) to respond to 16 times more harmful queries, while only modifying 0.006% of the parameters, in contrast to the ~ 5% modification required in previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate that attention heads primarily function as feature extractors for safety and models fine-tuned from the same base model exhibit overlapping safety heads through comprehensive experiments. Together, our attribution approach and findings provide a novel perspective for unpacking the black box of safety mechanisms within large models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sandeep Nagar, Girish Varma</p>
<p>Abstract: The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use the Inverse of Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverse of convolution layer, resulting in fast training times also. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</p>

More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we establish universal approximation results within function spaces defined over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, including $L^p$-spaces, weighted $C^k$-spaces, and weighted Sobolev spaces, where the latter two include the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Moreover, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Bai, Yi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Neurons in auto-regressive language models like GPT-2 can be interpreted by analyzing their activation patterns. Recent studies have shown that techniques such as dictionary learning, a form of post-hoc sparse coding, enhance this neuron-level interpretability. In our research, we are driven by the goal to fundamentally improve neural network interpretability by embedding sparse coding directly within the model architecture, rather than applying it as an afterthought. In our study, we introduce a white-box transformer-like architecture named Coding RAte TransformEr (CRATE), explicitly engineered to capture sparse, low-dimensional structures within data distributions. Our comprehensive experiments showcase significant improvements (up to 103% relative improvement) in neuron-level interpretability across a variety of evaluation metrics. Detailed investigations confirm that this enhanced interpretability is steady across different layers irrespective of the model size, underlining CRATE's robust performance in enhancing neural network interpretability. Further analysis shows that CRATE's increased interpretability comes from its enhanced ability to consistently and distinctively activate on relevant tokens. These findings point towards a promising direction for creating white-box foundation models that excel in neuron-level interpretation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanya Chowdhury, Atharva Nijasure, James Allan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer networks, particularly those achieving performance comparable to GPT models, are well known for their robust feature extraction abilities. However, the nature of these extracted features and their alignment with human-engineered ones remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms of state-of-the-art, fine-tuned LLMs for passage reranking. We employ a probing-based analysis to examine neuron activations in ranking LLMs, identifying the presence of known human-engineered and semantic features. Our study spans a broad range of feature categories, including lexical signals, document structure, query-document interactions, and complex semantic representations, to uncover underlying patterns influencing ranking decisions.
  Through experiments on four different ranking LLMs, we identify statistical IR features that are prominently encoded in LLM activations, as well as others that are notably missing. Furthermore, we analyze how these models respond to out-of-distribution queries and documents, revealing distinct generalization behaviors. By dissecting the latent representations within LLM activations, we aim to improve both the interpretability and effectiveness of ranking models. Our findings offer crucial insights for developing more transparent and reliable retrieval systems, and we release all necessary scripts and code to support further exploration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sam Blouir, Jimmy T. H. Smith, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Amarda Shehu</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient state space models (SSMs), such as linear recurrent neural networks and linear attention variants, offer computational advantages over Transformers but struggle with tasks requiring long-range in-context retrieval-like text copying, associative recall, and question answering over long contexts. Previous efforts to address these challenges have focused on architectural modifications, often reintroducing computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure, Birdie, that significantly enhances the in-context retrieval capabilities of SSMs without altering their architecture. Our approach combines bidirectional input processing with dynamic mixtures of specialized pre-training objectives, optimized via reinforcement learning. We introduce a new bidirectional SSM architecture that seamlessly transitions from bidirectional context processing to causal generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Birdie markedly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks such as multi-number phone book lookup, long paragraph question-answering, and infilling. This narrows the performance gap with Transformers, while retaining computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of training procedures in leveraging the fixed-state capacity of SSMs, offering a new direction to advance their capabilities.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02571">MM-Embed: Universal Multimodal Retrieval with Multimodal LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sheng-Chieh Lin, Chankyu Lee, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jimmy Lin, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Zhuo, Ya Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaoqing Li, Xun Zhou, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

<p>Abstract: Existing text simplification or paraphrase datasets mainly focus on sentence-level text generation in a general domain. These datasets are typically developed without using domain knowledge. In this paper, we release a novel dataset, VTechAGP, which is the first academic-to-general-audience text paraphrase dataset consisting of document-level these and dissertation academic and general-audience abstract pairs from 8 colleges authored over 25 years. We also propose a novel dynamic soft prompt generative language model, DSPT5. For training, we leverage a contrastive-generative loss function to learn the keyword vectors in the dynamic prompt. For inference, we adopt a crowd-sampling decoding strategy at both semantic and structural levels to further select the best output candidate. We evaluate DSPT5 and various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) from multiple perspectives. Results demonstrate that the SOTA LLMs do not provide satisfactory outcomes, while the lightweight DSPT5 can achieve competitive results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to build a benchmark dataset and solutions for academic-to-general-audience text paraphrase dataset. Models will be public after acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark D. Risser, Marcus M. Noack, Hengrui Luo, Ronald Pandolfi</p>
<p>Abstract: The Gaussian process (GP) is a widely used probabilistic machine learning method with implicit uncertainty characterization for stochastic function approximation, stochastic modeling, and analyzing real-world measurements of nonlinear processes. Traditional implementations of GPs involve stationary kernels (also termed covariance functions) that limit their flexibility, and exact methods for inference that prevent application to data sets with more than about ten thousand points. Modern approaches to address stationarity assumptions generally fail to accommodate large data sets, while all attempts to address scalability focus on approximating the Gaussian likelihood, which can involve subjectivity and lead to inaccuracies. In this work, we explicitly derive an alternative kernel that can discover and encode both sparsity and nonstationarity. We embed the kernel within a fully Bayesian GP model and leverage high-performance computing resources to enable the analysis of massive data sets. We demonstrate the favorable performance of our novel kernel relative to existing exact and approximate GP methods across a variety of synthetic data examples. Furthermore, we conduct space-time prediction based on more than one million measurements of daily maximum temperature and verify that our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in the Earth sciences. More broadly, having access to exact GPs that use ultra-scalable, sparsity-discovering, nonstationary kernels allows GP methods to truly compete with a wide variety of machine learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Liu, Jirui Qi, Paul He, Arianna Bisazza, Mrinmaya Sachan, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation are easily influenced by the order, in which the retrieved documents are presented to the model when solving tasks such as question answering (QA). However, there is no method to date that exploits this phenomenon to improve generation. We fill this gap. In this study, we show that the pointwise mutual information between a context and a question is an effective gauge for language model performance. Importantly, this gauge does not depend on knowing the answer to the question a priori. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets and a variety of large language models, we find evidence for an empirical correlation between answer accuracy and pointwise mutual information. Additionally, we propose two methods that use the pointwise mutual information between a document and a question as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance, whose effectiveness we demonstrate through experimentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model unlearning aims to remove harmful information that LLMs have learnt to prevent their use for malicious purposes. LLMU and RMU have been proposed as two methods for LLM unlearning, achieving impressive results on unlearning benchmarks. We study in detail the impact of unlearning on LLM performance metrics using the WMDP dataset as well as a new biology dataset we create. We show that unlearning has a notable impact on general model capabilities, with the performance degradation being more significant in general for LLMU. We further test the robustness of the two methods and find that doing 5-shot prompting or rephrasing the question in simple ways can lead to an over ten-fold increase in accuracy on unlearning benchmarks. Finally, we show that training on unrelated data can almost completely recover pre-unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods fail at truly unlearning. Our methodology serves as an evaluation framework for LLM unlearning methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/JaiDoshi/Knowledge-Erasure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> An Wang, Li Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyeon Yoon, Wonje Jeung, Albert No</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) in the final model setting is challenging and often results in empirical lower bounds that are significantly looser than theoretical privacy guarantees. We introduce a novel auditing method that achieves tighter empirical lower bounds without additional assumptions by crafting worst-case adversarial samples through loss-based input-space auditing. Our approach surpasses traditional canary-based heuristics and is effective in final model-only scenarios. Specifically, with a theoretical privacy budget of $\varepsilon = 10.0$, our method achieves empirical lower bounds of $4.914$, compared to the baseline of $4.385$ for MNIST. Our work offers a practical framework for reliable and accurate privacy auditing in differentially private machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjie Wang, Denis Deratani Mau\'a, Guy Van den Broeck, YooJung Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Circuits based on sum-product structure have become a ubiquitous representation to compactly encode knowledge, from Boolean functions to probability distributions. By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operators to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries - including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment - correspond to a combination of basic operators over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operators, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bharath Raj S, Garvit Suri, Vikrant Dewangan, Raghav Sonavane</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashutosh Bajpai, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages. To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON, a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts. To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores. Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages -- Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhe Wang, Shengyu Zhang, Jie Zhang, Runyi Hu, Xiaoya Li, Tianwei Zhang, Jiwei Li, Fei Wu, Guoyin Wang, Eduard Hovy</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhanced large language models (LLMs), particularly exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have exhibited outstanding performance. Despite the effectiveness in improving LLM capabilities, its implementation remains highly complex, requiring complex algorithms, reward modeling strategies, and optimization techniques. This complexity poses challenges for researchers and practitioners in developing a systematic understanding of RL-enhanced LLMs. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive survey summarizing existing research on RL-enhanced LLMs has limited progress in this domain, hindering further advancements.
  In this work, we are going to make a systematic review of the most up-to-date state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4) explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs with human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and deficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further improvements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e., punctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Ding, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyi He, Haoyue Tang, Jiayu Pan, Jintao Wang, Jian Song, Leandros Tassiulas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study a system in which a sensor forwards status updates to a receiver through an error-prone channel, while the receiver sends the transmission results back to the sensor via a reliable channel. Both channels are subject to random delays. To evaluate the timeliness of the status information at the receiver, we use the Age of Information (AoI) metric. The objective is to design a sampling policy that minimizes the expected time-average AoI, even when the channel statistics (e.g., delay distributions) are unknown. We first review the threshold structure of the optimal offline policy under known channel statistics and then reformulate the design of the online algorithm as a stochastic approximation problem. We propose a Robbins-Monro algorithm to solve this problem and demonstrate that the optimal threshold can be approximated almost surely. Moreover, we prove that the cumulative AoI regret of the online algorithm increases with rate $\mathcal{O}(\ln K)$, where $K$ is the number of successful transmissions. In addition, our algorithm is shown to be minimax order optimal, in the sense that for any online learning algorithm, the cumulative AoI regret up to the $K$-th successful transmissions grows with the rate at least $\Omega(\ln K)$ in the worst case delay distribution. Finally, we improve the stability of the proposed online learning algorithm through a momentum-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results validate the performance of our proposed algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Liu, Zhengyuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered to have only a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Liu, Boran Wen, Xinpeng Liu, Zizheng Zhou, Hongwei Fan, Cewu Lu, Lizhuang Ma, Yulong Chen, Yong-Lu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal Human-Object Interaction (ST-HOI) understanding aims at detecting HOIs from videos, which is crucial for activity understanding. However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines. Data and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/HAKE-AVA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), typically focus on a limited set of coarse-grained values and are resource-intensive. Moreover, the correlations between these values remain implicit, leading to unclear explanations for value-steering outcomes. Our work argues that a latent causal value graph underlies the value dimensions of LLMs and that, despite alignment training, this structure remains significantly different from human value systems. We leverage these causal value graphs to guide two lightweight value-steering methods: role-based prompting and sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, effectively mitigating unexpected side effects. Furthermore, SAE provides a more fine-grained approach to value steering. Experiments on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jushang Qiu, Lei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention for its ability to efficiently represent spatiotemporal information in a lightweight format. Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton sequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around human physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework. Alternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture higher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex joint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces motion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a fresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action recognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both traditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN and Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal graph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against motion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of Taylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion dynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This study underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to effectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action recognition.</p>

<p>Abstract: LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD are widely used methods in distributed stochastic optimization, with numerous applications in machine learning, large-scale data processing, and federated learning. However, rigorously establishing their theoretical advantages over simpler methods, such as minibatch SGD (MbSGD), has proven challenging, as existing analyses often rely on strong assumptions, unrealistic premises, or overly restrictive scenarios.
  In this work, we revisit the convergence properties of LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD under a variety of existing or weaker conditions, including gradient similarity, Hessian similarity, weak convexity, and Lipschitz continuity of the Hessian. Our analysis shows that (i) LocalSGD achieves faster convergence compared to MbSGD for weakly convex functions without requiring stronger gradient similarity assumptions; (ii) LocalSGD benefits significantly from higher-order similarity and smoothness; and (iii) SCAFFOLD demonstrates faster convergence than MbSGD for a broader class of non-quadratic functions. These theoretical insights provide a clearer understanding of the conditions under which LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD outperform MbSGD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruilin Luo, Zhuofan Zheng, Yifan Wang, Yiyao Yu, Xinzhe Ni, Zicheng Lin, Jin Zeng, Yujiu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is widely used to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The introduction of process supervision for CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on improving test-time scaling, thereby unlocking the System 2-style thinking capabilities of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving both deliberate reasoning and fine-grained verification. In this work, we propose a novel framework that introduces System 2-style thinking to multimodal mathematical reasoning. We introduce a three-module CoT data synthesis process that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. This process generates MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset. Furthermore, we implement a dual-view trajectory labeling automation that targets both visual grounding fidelity and deductive chain validity, resulting in the DualMath-1.1M dataset. The URSA-8B model, trained on MMathCoT-1M, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among similarly sized multimodal LLMs on six popular reasoning benchmarks. Training URSA-8B further on the DualMath-1.1M dataset yields URSA-RM-8B, a verifier that enhances URSA-8B's test-time performance and surpasses strong closed-source multimodal MLLMs like GPT-4o.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phillip Rieger, Alessandro Pegoraro, Kavita Kumari, Tigist Abera, Jonathan Knauer, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi</p>
<p>Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a distributed deep learning approach enabling multiple clients and a server to collaboratively train and infer on a shared deep neural network (DNN) without requiring clients to share their private local data. The DNN is partitioned in SL, with most layers residing on the server and a few initial layers and inputs on the client side. This configuration allows resource-constrained clients to participate in training and inference. However, the distributed architecture exposes SL to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients can manipulate local datasets to alter the DNN's behavior. Existing defenses from other distributed frameworks like Federated Learning are not applicable, and there is a lack of effective backdoor defenses specifically designed for SL.
  We present SafeSplit, the first defense against client-side backdoor attacks in Split Learning (SL). SafeSplit enables the server to detect and filter out malicious client behavior by employing circular backward analysis after a client's training is completed, iteratively reverting to a trained checkpoint where the model under examination is found to be benign. It uses a two-fold analysis to identify client-induced changes and detect poisoned models. First, a static analysis in the frequency domain measures the differences in the layer's parameters at the server.

Our comprehensive evaluation across various data distributions, client counts, and attack scenarios demonstrates the high efficacy of this dual analysis in mitigating backdoor attacks while preserving model utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boye Niu, Yiliao Song, Kai Lian, Yifan Shen, Yu Yao, Kun Zhang, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in automated planning and task execution. However, the effective adjustment of agentic workflows during execution has not been well studied. An effective workflow adjustment is crucial in real-world scenarios, as the initial plan must adjust to unforeseen challenges and changing conditions in real time to ensure the efficient execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we define workflows as an activity-on-vertex (AOV) graph, which allows continuous workflow refinement by LLM agents through dynamic subtask allocation adjustment based on historical performance and previous AOVs. To further enhance framework performance, we emphasize modularity in workflow design based on evaluating parallelism and dependency complexity. With this design, our proposed multi-agent framework achieves efficient concurrent execution of subtasks, effective goal achievement, and enhanced error tolerance. Empirical results across various practical tasks demonstrate significant improvements in the efficiency of multi-agent frameworks through dynamic workflow refinement and modularization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuang Cui, Yi Li, Jiangmeng Li, Xiongxin Tang, Bing Su, Fanjiang Xu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Single image defocus deblurring (SIDD) aims to restore an all-in-focus image from a defocused one. Distribution shifts in defocused images generally lead to performance degradation of existing methods during out-of-distribution inferences. In this work, we gauge the intrinsic reason behind the performance degradation, which is identified as the heterogeneity of lens-specific point spread functions. Empirical evidence supports this finding, motivating us to employ a continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) paradigm for SIDD. However, traditional CTTA methods, which primarily rely on entropy minimization, cannot sufficiently explore task-dependent information for pixel-level regression tasks like SIDD. To address this issue, we propose a novel Siamese networks-based continual test-time adaptation framework, which adapts source models to continuously changing target domains only requiring unlabeled target data in an online manner. To further mitigate semantically erroneous textures introduced by source SIDD models under severe degradation, we revisit the learning paradigm through a structural causal model and propose Causal Siamese networks (CauSiam). Our method leverages large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to derive discriminative universal semantic priors and integrates these priors into Siamese networks, ensuring causal identifiability between blurry inputs and restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CauSiam effectively improves the generalization performance of existing SIDD methods in continuously changing domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramchandran Muthukumar, Ambar Pal, Jeremias Sulam, Rene Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations to their input, where ``small'' is defined according to a threat model that assigns a positive threat to each perturbation. Most prior works define a task-agnostic, isotropic, and global threat, like the $\ell_p$ norm, where the magnitude of the perturbation fully determines the degree of the threat and neither the direction of the attack nor its position in space matter. However, common corruptions in computer vision, such as blur, compression, or occlusions, are not well captured by such threat models. This paper proposes a novel threat model called \texttt{Projected Displacement} (PD) to study robustness beyond existing isotropic and global threat models. The proposed threat model measures the threat of a perturbation via its alignment with \textit{unsafe directions}, defined as directions in the input space along which a perturbation of sufficient magnitude changes the ground truth class label. Unsafe directions are identified locally for each input based on observed training data. In this way, the PD threat model exhibits anisotropy and locality. Experiments on Imagenet-1k data indicate that, for any input, the set of perturbations with small PD threat includes \textit{safe} perturbations of large $\ell_p$ norm that preserve the true label, such as noise, blur and compression, while simultaneously excluding \textit{unsafe} perturbations that alter the true label. Unlike perceptual threat models based on embeddings of large-vision models, the PD threat model can be readily computed for arbitrary classification tasks without pre-training or finetuning. Further additional task annotation such as sensitivity to image regions or concept hierarchies can be easily integrated into the assessment of threat and thus the PD threat model presents practitioners with a flexible, task-driven threat specification.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04793">$t$-Testing the Waters: Empirically Validating Assumptions for Reliable A/B-Testing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Olivier Jeunen</p>
<p>Abstract: A/B-tests are a cornerstone of experimental design on the web, with wide-ranging applications and use-cases. The statistical $t$-test comparing differences in means is the most commonly used method for assessing treatment effects, often justified through the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT ascertains that, as the sample size grows, the sampling distribution of the Average Treatment Effect converges to normality, making the $t$-test valid for sufficiently large sample sizes. When outcome measures are skewed or non-normal, quantifying what "sufficiently large" entails is not straightforward.
  To ensure that confidence intervals maintain proper coverage and that $p$-values accurately reflect the false positive rate, it is critical to validate this normality assumption. We propose a practical method to test this, by analysing repeatedly resampled A/A-tests. When the normality assumption holds, the resulting $p$-value distribution should be uniform, and this property can be tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This provides an efficient and effective way to empirically assess whether the $t$-test's assumptions are met, and the A/B-test is valid. We demonstrate our methodology and highlight how it helps to identify scenarios prone to inflated Type-I errors. Our approach provides a practical framework to ensure and improve the reliability and robustness of A/B-testing practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadab Ahamed, Simon Ghyselincks, Pablo Chang Huang Arias, Julian Kloiber, Yasin Ranjbar, Jingrong Tang, Niloufar Zakariaei, Eldad Haber</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetic data inversion is an important tool in geophysics, used to infer subsurface magnetic susceptibility distributions from surface magnetic field measurements. This inverse problem is inherently ill-posed, characterized by non-unique solutions, depth ambiguity, and sensitivity to noise. Traditional inversion approaches rely on predefined regularization techniques to stabilize solutions, limiting their adaptability to complex or diverse geological scenarios. In this study, we propose an approach that integrates variable dictionary learning and scale-space methods to address these challenges. Our method employs learned dictionaries, allowing for adaptive representation of complex subsurface features that are difficult to capture with predefined bases. Additionally, we extend classical variational inversion by incorporating multi-scale representations through a scale-space framework, enabling the progressive introduction of structural detail while mitigating overfitting. We implement both fixed and dynamic dictionary learning techniques, with the latter introducing iteration-dependent dictionaries for enhanced flexibility. Using a synthetic dataset to simulate geological scenarios, we demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional variational and dictionary-based methods. Our results highlight the potential of learned dictionaries, especially when coupled with scale-space dynamics, to improve model recovery and noise handling. These findings underscore the promise of our data-driven approach for advance magnetic data inversion and its applications in geophysical exploration, environmental assessment, and mineral prospecting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Gr\"oger, Pascal Baumann, Ludovic Amruthalingam, Laurent Simon, Ruksana Giurda, Simone Lionetti</p>
<p>Abstract: Effectively steering hearable devices requires understanding the acoustic environment around the user. In the computational analysis of sound scenes, foundation models have emerged as the state of the art to produce high-performance, robust, multi-purpose audio representations. We introduce and release Deep Evaluation of Audio Representations (DEAR), the first dataset and benchmark to evaluate the efficacy of foundation models in capturing essential acoustic properties for hearables. The dataset includes 1,158 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long, created by spatially mixing proprietary monologues with commercial, high-quality recordings of everyday acoustic scenes. Our benchmark encompasses eight tasks that assess the general context, speech sources, and technical acoustic properties of the audio scenes. Through our evaluation of four general-purpose audio representation models, we demonstrate that the BEATs model significantly surpasses its counterparts. This superiority underscores the advantage of models trained on diverse audio collections, confirming their applicability to a wide array of auditory tasks, including encoding the environment properties necessary for hearable steering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyu Wang, Ying Fang, Xiaofei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reverberant speech, denoting the speech signal degraded by the process of reverberation, contains crucial knowledge of both anechoic source speech and room impulse response (RIR). This work proposes a variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework with neural speech prior (VINP) for joint speech dereverberation and blind RIR identification. In VINP, a probabilistic signal model is constructed in the time-frequency (T-F) domain based on convolution transfer function (CTF) approximation. For the first time, we propose using an arbitrary discriminative dereverberation deep neural network (DNN) to predict the prior distribution of anechoic speech within a probabilistic model. By integrating both reverberant speech and the anechoic speech prior, VINP yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimations of the anechoic speech spectrum and CTF filter, respectively. After simple transformations, the waveforms of anechoic speech and RIR are estimated. Moreover, VINP is effective for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which sets it apart from most deep learning (DL)-based single-channel dereverberation approaches. Experiments on single-channel speech dereverberation demonstrate that VINP reaches an advanced level in most metrics related to human perception and displays unquestionable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in ASR-related metrics. For blind RIR identification, experiments indicate that VINP attains the SOTA level in blind estimation of reverberation time at 60 dB (RT60) and direct-to-reverberation ratio (DRR). Codes and audio samples are available online.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hypercomplex image processing extends conventional techniques in a unified paradigm encompassing algebraic and geometric principles. This work leverages quaternions and the two-dimensional orthogonal planes split framework (splitting of a quaternion - representing a pixel - into pairs of orthogonal 2D planes) for natural/biomedical image analysis through the following computational workflows and outcomes: natural/biomedical image re-colorization, natural image de-colorization, natural/biomedical image contrast enhancement, computational re-staining and stain separation in histological images, and performance gains in machine/deep learning pipelines for histological images. The workflows are analyzed separately for natural and biomedical images to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The proposed workflows can regulate color appearance (e.g. with alternative renditions and grayscale conversion) and image contrast, be part of automated image processing pipelines (e.g. isolating stain components, boosting learning models), and assist in digital pathology applications (e.g. enhancing biomarker visibility, enabling colorblind-friendly renditions). Employing only basic arithmetic and matrix operations, this work offers a computationally accessible methodology - in the hypercomplex domain - that showcases versatility and consistency across image processing tasks and a range of computer vision and biomedical applications. The proposed non-data-driven methods achieve comparable or better results (particularly in cases involving well-known methods) to those reported in the literature, showcasing the potential of robust theoretical frameworks with practical effectiveness. Results, methods, and limitations are detailed alongside discussion of promising extensions, emphasizing the potential of feature-rich mathematical/computational frameworks for natural and biomedical images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Canchen Jiang, Ariel Liebman, Bo Jie, Hao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) coordination can provide significant benefits through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) by interacting with the grid, buildings, and other EVs. This work aims to develop a V2X value-stacking framework, including vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading, to maximize economic benefits for residential communities while maintaining distribution voltage. This work also seeks to quantify the impact of prediction errors related to building load, renewable energy, and EV arrivals. A dynamic rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) method is employed to leverage multiple revenue streams and maximize the potential of EV coordination. To address energy uncertainties, including hourly local building load, local photovoltaic (PV) generation, and EV arrivals, this work develops a Transformer-based forecasting model named Gated Recurrent Units-Encoder-Temporal Fusion Decoder (GRU-EN-TFD). The simulation results, using real data from Australia's National Electricity Market, and the Independent System Operators in New England and New York in the US, reveal that V2X value stacking can significantly reduce energy costs. The proposed GRU-EN-TFD model outperforms the benchmark forecast model. Uncertainties in EV arrivals have a more substantial impact on value-stacking performance, highlighting the significance of its accurate forecast. This work provides new insights into the dynamic interactions among residential communities, unlocking the full potential of EV batteries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huayi Wang, Zirui Wang, Junli Ren, Qingwei Ben, Tao Huang, Weinan Zhang, Jiangmiao Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traversing risky terrains with sparse footholds poses a significant challenge for humanoid robots, requiring precise foot placements and stable locomotion. Existing approaches designed for quadrupedal robots often fail to generalize to humanoid robots due to differences in foot geometry and unstable morphology, while learning-based approaches for humanoid locomotion still face great challenges on complex terrains due to sparse foothold reward signals and inefficient learning processes. To address these challenges, we introduce BeamDojo, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed for enabling agile humanoid locomotion on sparse footholds. BeamDojo begins by introducing a sampling-based foothold reward tailored for polygonal feet, along with a double critic to balancing the learning process between dense locomotion rewards and sparse foothold rewards. To encourage sufficient trail-and-error exploration, BeamDojo incorporates a two-stage RL approach: the first stage relaxes the terrain dynamics by training the humanoid on flat terrain while providing it with task terrain perceptive observations, and the second stage fine-tunes the policy on the actual task terrain. Moreover, we implement a onboard LiDAR-based elevation map to enable real-world deployment. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that BeamDojo achieves efficient learning in simulation and enables agile locomotion with precise foot placement on sparse footholds in the real world, maintaining a high success rate even under significant external disturbances.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Burc Gokden</p>
<p>Abstract: We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing MRI from highly undersampled measurements is crucial for accelerating medical imaging, but is challenging due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. While supervised deep learning approaches have shown remarkable success, they rely on fully-sampled ground truth data, which is often impractical or impossible to obtain. Recently, numerous self-supervised methods have emerged that do not require ground truth, however, the lack of systematic comparison and standard experimental setups have hindered research. We present the first comprehensive review of loss functions from all feedforward self-supervised methods and the first benchmark on accelerated MRI reconstruction without ground truth, showing that there is a wide range in performance across methods. In addition, we propose Multi-Operator Equivariant Imaging (MO-EI), a novel framework that builds on the imaging model considered in existing methods to outperform all state-of-the-art and approaches supervised performance. Finally, to facilitate reproducible benchmarking, we provide implementations of all methods in the DeepInverse library (https://deepinv.github.io) and easy-to-use demo code at https://andrewwango.github.io/deepinv-selfsup-fastmri.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joeran Beel, Min-Yen Kan, Moritz Baumgart</p>
<p>Abstract: A major step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Super Intelligence is AI's ability to autonomously conduct research - what we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). If machines could generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write research papers without human intervention, it would transform science. Sakana recently introduced the 'AI Scientist', claiming to conduct research autonomously, i.e. they imply to have achieved what we term Artificial Research Intelligence (ARI). The AI Scientist gained much attention, but a thorough independent evaluation has yet to be conducted.
  Our evaluation of the AI Scientist reveals critical shortcomings. The system's literature reviews produced poor novelty assessments, often misclassifying established concepts (e.g., micro-batching for stochastic gradient descent) as novel. It also struggles with experiment execution: 42% of experiments failed due to coding errors, while others produced flawed or misleading results. Code modifications were minimal, averaging 8% more characters per iteration, suggesting limited adaptability. Generated manuscripts were poorly substantiated, with a median of five citations, most outdated (only five of 34 from 2020 or later). Structural errors were frequent, including missing figures, repeated sections, and placeholder text like 'Conclusions Here'. Some papers contained hallucinated numerical results.
  Despite these flaws, the AI Scientist represents a leap forward in research automation. It generates full research manuscripts with minimal human input, challenging expectations of AI-driven science. Many reviewers might struggle to distinguish its work from human researchers. While its quality resembles a rushed undergraduate paper, its speed and cost efficiency are unprecedented, producing a full paper for USD 6 to 15 with 3.5 hours of human involvement, far outpacing traditional researchers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seokhun Park, Insung Kong, Yongchan Choi, Chanmoo Park, Yongdai Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpretability for machine learning models is becoming more and more important as machine learning models become more complex. The functional ANOVA model, which decomposes a high-dimensional function into a sum of lower dimensional functions so called components, is one of the most popular tools for interpretable AI, and recently, various neural network models have been developed for estimating each component in the functional ANOVA model. However, such neural networks are highly unstable when estimating components since the components themselves are not uniquely defined. That is, there are multiple functional ANOVA decompositions for a given function. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model which guarantees a unique functional ANOVA decomposition and thus is able to estimate each component stably. We call our proposed model ANOVA-NODE since it is a modification of Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE) for the functional ANOVA model. Theoretically, we prove that ANOVA-NODE can approximate a smooth function well. Additionally, we experimentally show that ANOVA-NODE provides much more stable estimation of each component and thus much more stable interpretation when training data and initial values of the model parameters vary than existing neural network models do.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sathwik Narkedimilli, Venkata Sriram Amballa, N V Saran Kumar, R Arun Kumar, R Praneeth Reddy, Satvik Raghav, Manish M, Aswath Babu H</p>
<p>Abstract: In the case of Type-2 AGNs, estimating the mass of the black hole is challenging. Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires considerable insight into the mass of black holes. This work compared different classical and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms for black hole mass estimation, wherein the classical algorithms are Linear Regression, XGBoost Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Bayesian Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Booster Regressor, Classical Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM, Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) and Transformer-Based Regression. On the other hand, quantum algorithms including Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (Q-LSTM), Sampler-QNN, Estimator-QNN, Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR), Quantum Linear Regression(Q-LR), QML with JAX optimization were also tested. The results revealed that classical algorithms gave better R^2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE results than the quantum models. Among the classical models, LSTM has the best result with an accuracy of 99.77%. Estimator-QNN has the highest accuracy for quantum algorithms with an MSE of 0.0124 and an accuracy of 99.75%. This study ascertains both the strengths and weaknesses of the classical and the quantum approaches. As far as our knowledge goes, this work could pave the way for the future application of quantum algorithms in astrophysical data analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The leading AI companies are increasingly focused on building generalist AI agents -- systems that can autonomously plan, act, and pursue goals across almost all tasks that humans can perform. Despite how useful these systems might be, unchecked AI agency poses significant risks to public safety and security, ranging from misuse by malicious actors to a potentially irreversible loss of human control. We discuss how these risks arise from current AI training methods. Indeed, various scenarios and experiments have demonstrated the possibility of AI agents engaging in deception or pursuing goals that were not specified by human operators and that conflict with human interests, such as self-preservation. Following the precautionary principle, we see a strong need for safer, yet still useful, alternatives to the current agency-driven trajectory. Accordingly, we propose as a core building block for further advances the development of a non-agentic AI system that is trustworthy and safe by design, which we call Scientist AI. This system is designed to explain the world from observations, as opposed to taking actions in it to imitate or please humans. It comprises a world model that generates theories to explain data and a question-answering inference machine. Both components operate with an explicit notion of uncertainty to mitigate the risks of overconfident predictions. In light of these considerations, a Scientist AI could be used to assist human researchers in accelerating scientific progress, including in AI safety. In particular, our system can be employed as a guardrail against AI agents that might be created despite the risks involved. Ultimately, focusing on non-agentic AI may enable the benefits of AI innovation while avoiding the risks associated with the current trajectory. We hope these arguments will motivate researchers, developers, and policymakers to favor this safer path.</p>
