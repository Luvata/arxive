<p><b>Authors:</b> Vittorio Giammarino, James Queeney, Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose C-LAIfO, a computationally efficient algorithm designed for imitation learning from videos, even in the presence of visual mismatch between agent and expert domains. We analyze the problem of imitation from expert videos with visual discrepancies, and introduce a solution for robust latent space estimation using contrastive learning and data augmentation. Provided a visually robust latent space, our algorithm performs imitation entirely within this space using off-policy adversarial imitation learning. We conduct a thorough ablation study to justify our design choices and test C-LAIfO on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how C-LAIfO can be combined with other reward signals to facilitate learning on a set of challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. Our experiments show improved performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of C-LAIfO. To ensure reproducibility, we provide open access to our code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Jiang, Taihang Wang, Xiaoman Xu, Yimin Wang, Xingyi Song, Diana Maynard</p>
<p>Abstract: The nascent topic of fake news requires automatic detection methods to quickly learn from limited annotated samples. Therefore, the capacity to rapidly acquire proficiency in a new task with limited guidance, also known as few-shot learning, is critical for detecting fake news in its early stages. Existing approaches either involve fine-tuning pre-trained language models which come with a large number of parameters, or training a complex neural network from scratch with large-scale annotated datasets. This paper presents a multimodal fake news detection model which augments multimodal features using unimodal features. For this purpose, we introduce Cross-Modal Augmentation (CMA), a simple approach for enhancing few-shot multimodal fake news detection by transforming n-shot classification into a more robust (n $\times$ z)-shot problem, where z represents the number of supplementary features. The proposed CMA achieves SOTA results over three benchmark datasets, utilizing a surprisingly simple linear probing method to classify multimodal fake news with only a few training samples. Furthermore, our method is significantly more lightweight than prior approaches, particularly in terms of the number of trainable parameters and epoch times.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Shen, Yuhan Duan, Han-Wei Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing deep learning-based surrogate models facilitate efficient data generation, but fall short in uncertainty quantification, efficient parameter space exploration, and reverse prediction. In our work, we introduce SurroFlow, a novel normalizing flow-based surrogate model, to learn the invertible transformation between simulation parameters and simulation outputs. The model not only allows accurate predictions of simulation outcomes for a given simulation parameter but also supports uncertainty quantification in the data generation process. Additionally, it enables efficient simulation parameter recommendation and exploration. We integrate SurroFlow and a genetic algorithm as the backend of a visual interface to support effective user-guided ensemble simulation exploration and visualization. Our framework significantly reduces the computational costs while enhancing the reliability and exploration capabilities of scientific surrogate models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ghadeer Jaradat, Mohammed Tolba, Ghada Alsuhli, Hani Saleh, Mahmoud Al-Qutayri, Thanos Stouraitis, Baker Mohammad</p>
<p>Abstract: In the world of deep learning, Transformer models have become very significant, leading to improvements in many areas from understanding language to recognizing images, covering a wide range of applications. Despite their success, the deployment of these models in real-time applications, particularly on edge devices, poses significant challenges due to their quadratic computational intensity and memory demands. To overcome these challenges we introduce a novel Hybrid Dynamic Pruning (HDP), an efficient algorithm-architecture co-design approach that accelerates transformers using head sparsity, block sparsity and approximation opportunities to reduce computations in attention and reduce memory access. With the observation of the huge redundancy in attention scores and attention heads, we propose a novel integer-based row-balanced block pruning to prune unimportant blocks in the attention matrix at run time, also propose integer-based head pruning to detect and prune unimportant heads at an early stage at run time. Also we propose an approximation method that reduces attention computations. To efficiently support these methods with lower latency and power efficiency, we propose a HDP co-processor architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisandro A. Jimenez-Roa, Thiago D. Sim\~ao, Zaharah Bukhsh, Tiedo Tinga, Hajo Molegraaf, Nils Jansen, Marielle Stoelinga</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale infrastructure systems are crucial for societal welfare, and their effective management requires strategic forecasting and intervention methods that account for various complexities. Our study addresses two challenges within the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) framework applied to sewer assets: modeling pipe degradation across severity levels and developing effective maintenance policies. We employ Multi-State Degradation Models (MSDM) to represent the stochastic degradation process in sewer pipes and use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to devise maintenance strategies. A case study of a Dutch sewer network exemplifies our methodology. Our findings demonstrate the model's effectiveness in generating intelligent, cost-saving maintenance strategies that surpass heuristics. It adapts its management strategy based on the pipe's age, opting for a passive approach for newer pipes and transitioning to active strategies for older ones to prevent failures and reduce costs. This research highlights DRL's potential in optimizing maintenance policies. Future research will aim improve the model by incorporating partial observability, exploring various reinforcement learning algorithms, and extending this methodology to comprehensive infrastructure management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishi Bommasani, Kevin Klyman, Sayash Kapoor, Shayne Longpre, Betty Xiong, Nestor Maslej, Percy Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly consequential yet extremely opaque. To characterize the status quo, the Foundation Model Transparency Index was launched in October 2023 to measure the transparency of leading foundation model developers. The October 2023 Index (v1.0) assessed 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google) on 100 transparency indicators (e.g. does the developer disclose the wages it pays for data labor?). At the time, developers publicly disclosed very limited information with the average score being 37 out of 100. To understand how the status quo has changed, we conduct a follow-up study (v1.1) after 6 months: we score 14 developers against the same 100 indicators. While in v1.0 we searched for publicly available information, in v1.1 developers submit reports on the 100 transparency indicators, potentially including information that was not previously public. We find that developers now score 58 out of 100 on average, a 21 point improvement over v1.0. Much of this increase is driven by developers disclosing information during the v1.1 process: on average, developers disclosed information related to 16.6 indicators that was not previously public. We observe regions of sustained (i.e. across v1.0 and v1.1) and systemic (i.e. across most or all developers) opacity such as on copyright status, data access, data labor, and downstream impact. We publish transparency reports for each developer that consolidate information disclosures: these reports are based on the information disclosed to us via developers. Our findings demonstrate that transparency can be improved in this nascent ecosystem, the Foundation Model Transparency Index likely contributes to these improvements, and policymakers should consider interventions in areas where transparency has not improved.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12979">Leveraging Environment Interaction for Automated PDDL Generation and Planning with Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sadegh Mahdavi, Raquel Aoki, Keyi Tang, Yanshuai Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language tasks, but they often struggle with planning problems that require structured reasoning. To address this limitation, the conversion of planning problems into the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) has been proposed as a potential solution, enabling the use of automated planners. However, generating accurate PDDL files typically demands human inputs or correction, which can be time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages LLMs and environment feedback to automatically generate PDDL domain and problem description files without the need for human intervention. Our method introduces an iterative refinement process that generates multiple problem PDDL candidates and progressively refines the domain PDDL based on feedback obtained from interacting with the environment. To guide the refinement process, we develop an Exploration Walk (EW) metric, which provides rich feedback signals for LLMs to update the PDDL file. We evaluate our approach on PDDL environments. We achieve an average task solve rate of 66% compared to a 29% solve rate by GPT-4's intrinsic planning with chain-of-thought prompting. Our work enables the automated modeling of planning environments using LLMs and environment feedback, eliminating the need for human intervention in the PDDL generation process and paving the way for more reliable LLM agents in challenging problems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12980">A Framework for testing Federated Learning algorithms using an edge-like environment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Machado Schwanck, Marcos Tomazzoli Leipnitz, Joel Lu\'is Carbonera, Juliano Araujo Wickboldt</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm in which many clients cooperatively train a single centralized model while keeping their data private and decentralized. FL is commonly used in edge computing, which involves placing computer workloads (both hardware and software) as close as possible to the edge, where the data is being created and where actions are occurring, enabling faster response times, greater data privacy, and reduced data transfer costs. However, due to the heterogeneous data distributions/contents of clients, it is non-trivial to accurately evaluate the contributions of local models in global centralized model aggregation. This is an example of a major challenge in FL, commonly known as data imbalance or class imbalance. In general, testing and assessing FL algorithms can be a very difficult and complex task due to the distributed nature of the systems. In this work, a framework is proposed and implemented to assess FL algorithms in a more easy and scalable way. This framework is evaluated over a distributed edge-like environment managed by a container orchestration platform (i.e. Kubernetes).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> To Eun Kim, Alireza Salemi, Andrew Drozdov, Fernando Diaz, Hamed Zamani</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of language modeling, models augmented with retrieval components have emerged as a promising solution to address several challenges faced in the natural language processing (NLP) field, including knowledge grounding, interpretability, and scalability. Despite the primary focus on NLP, we posit that the paradigm of retrieval-enhancement can be extended to a broader spectrum of machine learning (ML) such as computer vision, time series prediction, and computational biology. Therefore, this work introduces a formal framework of this paradigm, Retrieval-Enhanced Machine Learning (REML), by synthesizing the literature in various domains in ML with consistent notations which is missing from the current literature. Also, we found that while a number of studies employ retrieval components to augment their models, there is a lack of integration with foundational Information Retrieval (IR) research. We bridge this gap between the seminal IR research and contemporary REML studies by investigating each component that comprises the REML framework. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to equip researchers across various disciplines with a comprehensive, formally structured framework of retrieval-enhanced models, thereby fostering interdisciplinary future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanyun Xie, Fabian Latorre, Kimon Antonakopoulos, Thomas Pethick, Volkan Cevher</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper rethinks Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which is originally formulated as a zero-sum game where the weights of a network and a bounded perturbation try to minimize/maximize, respectively, the same differentiable loss. To fundamentally improve this design, we argue that SAM should instead be reformulated using the 0-1 loss. As a continuous relaxation, we follow the simple conventional approach where the minimizing (maximizing) player uses an upper bound (lower bound) surrogate to the 0-1 loss. This leads to a novel formulation of SAM as a bilevel optimization problem, dubbed as BiSAM. BiSAM with newly designed lower-bound surrogate loss indeed constructs stronger perturbation. Through numerical evidence, we show that BiSAM consistently results in improved performance when compared to the original SAM and variants, while enjoying similar computational complexity.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathaniel Dean, Dilip Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: The mainstream AI community has seen a rise in large-scale open-source classifiers, often pre-trained on vast datasets and tested on standard benchmarks; however, users facing diverse needs and limited, expensive test data may be overwhelmed by available choices. Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers undergo training, validation, and testing phases using example dataset, with the testing phase focused on determining the classification accuracy of test examples without delving into the inner working of the classifier. In this work, we evaluate a DNN classifier's training quality without any example dataset. It is assumed that a DNN is a composition of a feature extractor and a classifier which is the penultimate completely connected layer. The quality of a classifier is estimated using its weight vectors. The feature extractor is characterized using two metrics that utilize feature vectors it produces when synthetic data is fed as input. These synthetic input vectors are produced by backpropagating desired outputs of the classifier. Our empirical study of the proposed method for ResNet18, trained with CAFIR10 and CAFIR100 datasets, confirms that data-less evaluation of DNN classifiers is indeed possible.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13006">Sparsity-based Safety Conservatism for Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjae Cho, Chuangchuang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made notable success in decision-making fields like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. Yet, its reliance on real-time feedback poses challenges in costly or hazardous settings. Furthermore, RL's training approach, centered on "on-policy" sampling, doesn't fully capitalize on data. Hence, Offline RL has emerged as a compelling alternative, particularly in conducting additional experiments is impractical, and abundant datasets are available. However, the challenge of distributional shift (extrapolation), indicating the disparity between data distributions and learning policies, also poses a risk in offline RL, potentially leading to significant safety breaches due to estimation errors (interpolation). This concern is particularly pronounced in safety-critical domains, where real-world problems are prevalent. To address both extrapolation and interpolation errors, numerous studies have introduced additional constraints to confine policy behavior, steering it towards more cautious decision-making. While many studies have addressed extrapolation errors, fewer have focused on providing effective solutions for tackling interpolation errors. For example, some works tackle this issue by incorporating potential cost-maximizing optimization by perturbing the original dataset. However, this, involving a bi-level optimization structure, may introduce significant instability or complicate problem-solving in high-dimensional tasks. This motivates us to pinpoint areas where hazards may be more prevalent than initially estimated based on the sparsity of available data by providing significant insight into constrained offline RL. In this paper, we present conservative metrics based on data sparsity that demonstrate the high generalizability to any methods and efficacy compared to using bi-level cost-ub-maximization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahador Bahmani, Somdatta Goswami, Ioannis G. Kevrekidis, Michael D. Shields</p>
<p>Abstract: The Deep operator network (DeepONet) is a powerful yet simple neural operator architecture that utilizes two deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce a Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) that provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from the input data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which can be directly used by DeepONet without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as our trainable INR basis functions. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is becoming a necessity as concerns about data privacy intensify in the world. Tabular data can be useful for testing various systems, simulating real data, analyzing the data itself or building predictive models. Unfortunately, such data may not be available due to confidentiality issues. Previous techniques, such as TVAE (Xu et al., 2019) or OCTGAN (Kim et al., 2021), are either unable to handle particularly complex datasets, or are complex in themselves, resulting in inferior run time performance. This paper introduces PSVAE, a new simple model that is capable of producing high-quality synthetic data in less run time. PSVAE incorporates two key ideas: loss optimization and post-selection. Along with these ideas, the proposed model compensates for underrepresented categories and uses a modern activation function, Mish (Misra, 2019).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Ghaith Altarabichi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose DropKAN (Drop Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) a regularization method that prevents co-adaptation of activation function weights in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). DropKAN operates by randomly masking some of the post-activations within the KANs computation graph, while scaling-up the retained post-activations. We show that this simple procedure that require minimal coding effort has a regularizing effect and consistently lead to better generalization of KANs.
  We analyze the adaptation of the standard Dropout with KANs and demonstrate that Dropout applied to KANs' neurons can lead to unpredictable performance in the feedforward pass. We carry an empirical study with real world Machine Learning datasets to validate our findings. Our results suggest that DropKAN is consistently a better alternative to Dropout, and improves the generalization performance of KANs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nguyen Thach, Patrick Habecker, Bergen Johnston, Lillianna Cervantes, Anika Eisenbraun, Alex Mason, Kimberly Tyler, Bilal Khan, Hau Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Substance use is a global issue that negatively impacts millions of persons who use drugs (PWUDs). In practice, identifying vulnerable PWUDs for efficient allocation of appropriate resources is challenging due to their complex use patterns (e.g., their tendency to change usage within months) and the high acquisition costs for collecting PWUD-focused substance use data. Thus, there has been a paucity of machine learning models for accurately predicting short-term substance use behaviors of PWUDs. In this paper, using longitudinal survey data of 258 PWUDs in the U.S. Great Plains collected by our team, we design a novel GAN that deals with high-dimensional low-sample-size tabular data and survey skip logic to augment existing data to improve classification models' prediction on (A) whether the PWUDs would increase usage and (B) at which ordinal frequency they would use a particular drug within the next 12 months. Our evaluation results show that, when trained on augmented data from our proposed GAN, the classification models improve their predictive performance (AUROC) by up to 13.4% in Problem (A) and 15.8% in Problem (B) for usage of marijuana, meth, amphetamines, and cocaine, which outperform state-of-the-art generative models.</p>

However, its susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where adversaries insert triggers to manipulate outcomes, raises a critical concern. We conduct the first study to investigate such vulnerability, revealing that backdoors can disguise benign graph prompts, thus evading detection. We introduce Krait, a novel graph prompt backdoor. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic metric called label non-uniformity homophily to select poisoned candidates, significantly reducing computational complexity. To accommodate diverse attack scenarios and advanced attack types, we design three customizable trigger generation methods to craft prompts as triggers. We propose a novel centroid similarity-based loss function to optimize prompt tuning for attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Experiments on four real-world graphs demonstrate that Krait can efficiently embed triggers to merely 0.15% to 2% of training nodes, achieving high attack success rates without sacrificing clean accuracy. Notably, in one-to-one and all-to-one attacks, Krait can achieve 100% attack success rates by poisoning as few as 2 and 22 nodes, respectively. Our experiments further show that Krait remains potent across different transfer cases, attack types, and graph neural network backbones. Additionally, Krait can be successfully extended to the black-box setting, posing more severe threats. Finally, we analyze why Krait can evade both classical and state-of-the-art defenses, and provide practical insights for detecting and mitigating this class of attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Yue, Sixue Xing, Jintai Chen, Tianfan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical trials need to recruit a sufficient number of volunteer patients to demonstrate the statistical power of the treatment (e.g., a new drug) in curing a certain disease. Clinical trial recruitment has a significant impact on trial success. Forecasting whether the recruitment process would be successful before we run the trial would save many resources and time. This paper develops a novel deep & cross network with large language model (LLM)-augmented text feature that learns semantic information from trial eligibility criteria and predicts enrollment success. The proposed method enables interpretability by understanding which sentence/word in eligibility criteria contributes heavily to prediction. We also demonstrate the empirical superiority of the proposed method (0.7002 PR-AUC) over a bunch of well-established machine learning methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Liao, XiLu Wang, Yaochu Jin, WenLi Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying models across diverse devices demands tradeoffs among multiple objectives due to different resource constraints. Arguably, due to the small model trap problem in multi-objective neural architecture search (MO-NAS) based on a supernet, existing approaches may fail to maintain large models. Moreover, multi-tasking neural architecture search (MT-NAS) excels in handling multiple tasks simultaneously, but most existing efforts focus on tasks from the same dataset, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios where multiple tasks may come from distinct datasets. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Multi-Tasking framework for NAS (MO-EMT-NAS) to achieve architectural knowledge transfer across tasks from different datasets while finding Pareto optimal architectures for multi-objectives, model accuracy and computational efficiency. To alleviate the small model trap issue, we introduce an auxiliary objective that helps maintain multiple larger models of similar accuracy. Moreover, the computational efficiency is further enhanced by parallelizing the training and validation of the weight-sharing-based supernet. Experimental results on seven datasets with two, three, and four task combinations show that MO-EMT-NAS achieves a better minimum classification error while being able to offer flexible trade-offs between model performance and complexity, compared to the state-of-the-art single-objective MT-NAS algorithms. The runtime of MO-EMT-NAS is reduced by 59.7% to 77.7%, compared to the corresponding multi-objective single-task approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangwei Qi, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology with significant potential in the field of internet of vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicles to perform intensive computational tasks locally or offload them to nearby edge devices. However, the quality of communication links may be severely deteriorated due to obstacles such as buildings, impeding the offloading process. To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to assist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this work, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for local execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task arrivals and channel variations are taken into account. To address the scheme, we propose an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for optimizing RIS phase-shift coefficients and the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for optimizing the power allocation of vehicle user (VU). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional centralized DDPG, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and some typical stochastic schemes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aryan Gulati, Xingjian Dong, Carlos Hurtado, Sarath Shekkizhar, Swabha Swayamdipta, Antonio Ortega</p>
<p>Abstract: As language models become more general purpose, increased attention needs to be paid to detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, i.e., those not belonging to any of the distributions seen during training. Existing methods for detecting OOD data are computationally complex and storage-intensive. We propose a novel soft clustering approach for OOD detection based on non-negative kernel regression. Our approach greatly reduces computational and space complexities (up to 11x improvement in inference time and 87% reduction in storage requirements) and outperforms existing approaches by up to 4 AUROC points on four different benchmarks. We also introduce an entropy-constrained version of our algorithm, which leads to further reductions in storage requirements (up to 97% lower than comparable approaches) while retaining competitive performance. Our soft clustering approach for OOD detection highlights its potential for detecting tail-end phenomena in extreme-scale data settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irene Wang, Jakub Tarnawski, Amar Phanishayee, Divya Mahajan</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed execution of deep learning training involves a dynamic interplay between hardware accelerator architecture and device placement strategy. This is the first work to explore the co-optimization of determining the optimal architecture and device placement strategy through novel algorithms, improving the balance of computational resources, memory usage, and data distribution. Our architecture search leverages tensor and vector units, determining their quantity and dimensionality, and on-chip and off-chip memory configurations. It also determines the microbatch size and decides whether to recompute or stash activations, balancing the memory footprint of training and storage size. For each explored architecture configuration, we use an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to find the optimal schedule for executing operators on the accelerator. The ILP results then integrate with a dynamic programming solution to identify the most effective device placement strategy, combining data, pipeline, and tensor model parallelism across multiple accelerators. Our approach achieves higher throughput on large language models compared to the state-of-the-art TPUv4 and the Spotlight accelerator search framework.

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces PG-Rainbow, a novel algorithm that incorporates a distributional reinforcement learning framework with a policy gradient algorithm. Existing policy gradient methods are sample inefficient and rely on the mean of returns when calculating the state-action value function, neglecting the distributional nature of returns in reinforcement learning tasks. To address this issue, we use an Implicit Quantile Network that provides the quantile information of the distribution of rewards to the critic network of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. We show empirical results that through the integration of reward distribution information into the policy network, the policy agent acquires enhanced capabilities to comprehensively evaluate the consequences of potential actions in a given state, facilitating more sophisticated and informed decision-making processes. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the Atari-2600 game suite, simulated via the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuyu Zhu, Liang Zhang, Qianxiong Xu, Kaijun Liu, Cheng Long, Xiaoyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the success of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) in modeling real-world Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), challenges such as expressiveness limitations and over-smoothing have prompted researchers to explore Graph Transformers (GTs) for enhanced HIN representation learning. However, research on GT in HINs remains limited, with two key shortcomings in existing work: (1) A node's neighbors at different distances in HINs convey diverse semantics. Unfortunately, existing methods ignore such differences and uniformly treat neighbors within a given distance in a coarse manner, which results in semantic confusion. (2) Nodes in HINs have various types, each with unique semantics. Nevertheless, existing methods mix nodes of different types during neighbor aggregation, hindering the capture of proper correlations between nodes of diverse types. To bridge these gaps, we design an innovative structure named (k,t)-ring neighborhood, where nodes are initially organized by their distance, forming different non-overlapping k-ring neighborhoods for each distance. Within each k-ring structure, nodes are further categorized into different groups according to their types, thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of both distances and types in HINs naturally. Based on this structure, we propose a novel Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HHGT) model, which seamlessly integrates a Type-level Transformer for aggregating nodes of different types within each k-ring neighborhood, followed by a Ring-level Transformer for aggregating different k-ring neighborhoods in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on downstream tasks to verify HHGT's superiority over 14 baselines, with a notable improvement of up to 24.75% in NMI and 29.25% in ARI for node clustering task on the ACM dataset compared to the best baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Raj Rai, Rishant Pal, Amit Awekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large neural models are often compressed before deployment. Model compression is necessary for many practical reasons, such as inference latency, memory footprint, and energy consumption. Compressed models are assumed to be miniature versions of corresponding large neural models. However, we question this belief in our work. We compare compressed models with corresponding large neural models using four model characteristics: prediction errors, data representation, data distribution, and vulnerability to adversarial attack. We perform experiments using the BERT-large model and its five compressed versions. For all four model characteristics, compressed models significantly differ from the BERT-large model. Even among compressed models, they differ from each other on all four model characteristics. Apart from the expected loss in model performance, there are major side effects of using compressed models to replace large neural models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Li, Fangfang Zhu, Wenwen Min</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies is revolutionizing our understanding of the spatial organization of biological tissues. Current ST methods, categorized into next-generation sequencing-based (seq-based) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-based (image-based) methods, offer innovative insights into the functional dynamics of biological tissues. However, these methods are limited by their cellular resolution and the quantity of genes they can detect. To address these limitations, we propose SpaDiT, a deep learning method that utilizes a diffusion generative model to integrate scRNA-seq and ST data for the prediction of undetected genes. By employing a Transformer-based diffusion model, SpaDiT not only accurately predicts unknown genes but also effectively generates the spatial structure of ST genes. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SpaDiT through extensive experiments on both seq-based and image-based ST data. SpaDiT significantly contributes to ST gene prediction methods with its innovative approach. Compared to eight leading baseline methods, SpaDiT achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics, highlighting its substantial bioinformatics contribution.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13194">Robust Multivariate Time Series Forecasting against Intra- and Inter-Series Transitional Shift</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui He, Qi Zhang, Kun Yi, Xiaojun Xue, Shoujin Wang, Liang Hu, Longbing Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The non-stationary nature of real-world Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data presents forecasting models with a formidable challenge of the time-variant distribution of time series, referred to as distribution shift. Existing studies on the distribution shift mostly adhere to adaptive normalization techniques for alleviating temporal mean and covariance shifts or time-variant modeling for capturing temporal shifts. Despite improving model generalization, these normalization-based methods often assume a time-invariant transition between outputs and inputs but disregard specific intra-/inter-series correlations, while time-variant models overlook the intrinsic causes of the distribution shift. This limits model expressiveness and interpretability of tackling the distribution shift for MTS forecasting. To mitigate such a dilemma, we present a unified Probabilistic Graphical Model to Jointly capturing intra-/inter-series correlations and modeling the time-variant transitional distribution, and instantiate a neural framework called JointPGM for non-stationary MTS forecasting. Specifically, JointPGM first employs multiple Fourier basis functions to learn dynamic time factors and designs two distinct learners: intra-series and inter-series learners. The intra-series learner effectively captures temporal dynamics by utilizing temporal gates, while the inter-series learner explicitly models spatial dynamics through multi-hop propagation, incorporating Gumbel-softmax sampling. These two types of series dynamics are subsequently fused into a latent variable, which is inversely employed to infer time factors, generate final prediction, and perform reconstruction. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of JointPGM through extensive experiments on six highly non-stationary MTS datasets, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance of MTS forecasting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models often struggle with uncertainty when faced with new situations in online decision-making, necessitating scalable and efficient exploration to resolve this uncertainty. We introduce GPT-HyperAgent, an augmentation of GPT with HyperAgent for uncertainty-aware, scalable exploration in contextual bandits, a fundamental online decision problem involving natural language input. We prove that HyperAgent achieves fast incremental uncertainty estimation with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ per-step computational complexity over $T$ periods under the linear realizable assumption. Our analysis demonstrates that HyperAgent's regret order matches that of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits, closing a significant theoretical gap in scalable exploration. Empirical results in real-world contextual bandit tasks, such as automated content moderation with human feedback, validate the practical effectiveness of GPT-HyperAgent for safety-critical decisions.

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces LiNR, LinkedIn's large-scale, GPU-based retrieval system. LiNR supports a billion-sized index on GPU models. We discuss our experiences and challenges in creating scalable, differentiable search indexes using TensorFlow and PyTorch at production scale. In LiNR, both items and model weights are integrated into the model binary. Viewing index construction as a form of model training, we describe scaling our system for large indexes, incorporating full scans and efficient filtering. A key focus is on enabling attribute-based pre-filtering for exhaustive GPU searches, addressing the common challenge of post-filtering in KNN searches that often reduces system quality. We further provide multi-embedding retrieval algorithms and strategies for tackling cold start issues in retrieval. Our advancements in supporting larger indexes through quantization are also discussed. We believe LiNR represents one of the industry's first Live-updated model-based retrieval indexes. Applied to out-of-network post recommendations on LinkedIn Feed, LiNR has contributed to a 3% relative increase in professional daily active users. We envisage LiNR as a step towards integrating retrieval and ranking into a single GPU model, simplifying complex infrastructures and enabling end-to-end optimization of the entire differentiable infrastructure through gradient descent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the prevalence and significance of tabular data across numerous industries and fields, it has been relatively underexplored in the realm of deep learning. Even today, neural networks are often overshadowed by techniques such as gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT). However, recent models are beginning to close this gap, outperforming GBDT in various setups and garnering increased attention in the field. Inspired by this development, we introduce a novel stochastic deep learning model specifically designed for tabular data. The foundation of this model is a Transformer-based architecture, carefully adapted to cater to the unique properties of tabular data through strategic architectural modifications and leveraging two forms of stochastic competition. First, we employ stochastic "Local Winner Takes All" units to promote generalization capacity through stochasticity and sparsity. Second, we introduce a novel embedding layer that selects among alternative linear embedding layers through a mechanism of stochastic competition. The effectiveness of the model is validated on a variety of widely-used, publicly available datasets. We demonstrate that, through the incorporation of these elements, our model yields high performance and marks a significant advancement in the application of deep learning to tabular data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunjing Xiao, Shikang Pang, Wenxin Tai, Yanlong Huang, Goce Trajcevski, Fan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection is significant in diverse domains. To improve detection performance, counterfactual graphs have been exploited to benefit the generalization capacity by learning causal relations. Most existing studies directly introduce perturbations (e.g., flipping edges) to generate counterfactual graphs, which are prone to alter the semantics of generated examples and make them off the data manifold, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Motif-consistent Counterfactuals with Adversarial Refinement (MotifCAR), for graph-level anomaly detection. The model combines the motif of one graph, the core subgraph containing the identification (category) information, and the contextual subgraph (non-motif) of another graph to produce a raw counterfactual graph. However, the produced raw graph might be distorted and cannot satisfy the important counterfactual properties: Realism, Validity, Proximity and Sparsity. Towards that, we present a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based graph optimizer to refine the raw counterfactual graphs. It adopts the discriminator to guide the generator to generate graphs close to realistic data, i.e., meet the property Realism. Further, we design the motif consistency to force the motif of the generated graphs to be consistent with the realistic graphs, meeting the property Validity. Also, we devise the contextual loss and connection loss to control the contextual subgraph and the newly added links to meet the properties Proximity and Sparsity. As a result, the model can generate high-quality counterfactual graphs. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of MotifCAR.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series, characterized by a sequence of data points arranged in a discrete-time order, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Different from other modalities, time series present unique challenges due to their complex and dynamic nature, including the entanglement of nonlinear patterns and time-variant trends. Analyzing time series data is of great significance in real-world scenarios and has been widely studied over centuries. Recent years have witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in the time series community, with techniques shifting from traditional statistical methods to advanced deep learning models. In this paper, we delve into the design of deep time series models across various analysis tasks and review the existing literature from two perspectives: basic modules and model architectures. Further, we develop and release Time Series Library (TSLib) as a fair benchmark of deep time series models for diverse analysis tasks, which implements 24 mainstream models, covers 30 datasets from different domains, and supports five prevalent analysis tasks. Based on TSLib, we thoroughly evaluate 12 advanced deep time series models on different tasks. Empirical results indicate that models with specific structures are well-suited for distinct analytical tasks, which offers insights for research and adoption of deep time series models.

<p>Abstract: In deep reinforcement learning applications, maximizing discounted reward is often employed instead of maximizing total reward to ensure the convergence and stability of algorithms, even though the performance metric for evaluating the policy remains the total reward. However, the optimal policies corresponding to these two objectives may not always be consistent. To address this issue, we analyzed the suboptimality of the policy obtained through maximizing discounted reward in relation to the policy that maximizes total reward and identified the influence of hyperparameters. Additionally, we proposed sufficient conditions for aligning the optimal policies of these two objectives under various settings. The primary contributions are as follows: We theoretically analyzed the factors influencing performance when using discounted reward as a proxy for total reward, thereby enhancing the theoretical understanding of this scenario. Furthermore, we developed methods to align the optimal policies of the two objectives in certain situations, which can improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robi Bhattacharjee, Ulrike von Luxburg</p>
<p>Abstract: In sensitive contexts, providers of machine learning algorithms are increasingly required to give explanations for their algorithms' decisions. However, explanation receivers might not trust the provider, who potentially could output misleading or manipulated explanations. In this work, we investigate an auditing framework in which a third-party auditor or a collective of users attempts to sanity-check explanations: they can query model decisions and the corresponding local explanations, pool all the information received, and then check for basic consistency properties. We prove upper and lower bounds on the amount of queries that are needed for an auditor to succeed within this framework. Our results show that successful auditing requires a potentially exorbitant number of queries -- particularly in high dimensional cases. Our analysis also reveals that a key property is the ``locality'' of the provided explanations -- a quantity that so far has not been paid much attention to in the explainability literature. Looking forward, our results suggest that for complex high-dimensional settings, merely providing a pointwise prediction and explanation could be insufficient, as there is no way for the users to verify that the provided explanations are not completely made-up.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new solution to the problem of large-scale multi-building and multi-floor indoor localization based on linked neural networks, where each neural network is dedicated to a sub-problem and trained under a hierarchical stage-wise training framework. When the measured data from sensors have a hierarchical representation as in multi-building and multi-floor indoor localization, it is important to exploit the hierarchical nature in data processing to provide a scalable solution. In this regard, the hierarchical stage-wise training framework extends the original stage-wise training framework to the case of multiple linked networks by training a lower-hierarchy network based on the prior knowledge gained from the training of higher-hierarchy networks. The experimental results with the publicly-available UJIIndoorLoc multi-building and multi-floor Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprint database demonstrate that the linked neural networks trained under the proposed hierarchical stage-wise training framework can achieve a three-dimensional localization error of 8.19 m, which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the most accurate result ever obtained for neural network-based models trained and evaluated with the full datasets of the UJIIndoorLoc database, and that, when applied to a model based on hierarchical convolutional neural networks, the proposed training framework can also significantly reduce the three-dimensional localization error from 11.78 m to 8.71 m.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihao Li, Zhe Tang, Kyeong Soo Kim, Jeremy S. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting is widely applied for indoor localization due to the widespread availability of Wi-Fi devices. However, traditional methods are not ideal for multi-building and multi-floor environments due to the scalability issues. Therefore, more and more researchers have employed deep learning techniques to enable scalable indoor localization. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised learning framework for neural networks based on wireless access point selection, noise injection, and Mean Teacher model, which leverages unlabeled fingerprints to enhance localization performance. The proposed framework can manage hybrid in/outsourcing and voluntarily contributed databases and continually expand the fingerprint database with newly submitted unlabeled fingerprints during service. The viability of the proposed framework was examined using two established deep-learning models with the UJIIndoorLoc database. The experimental results suggest that the proposed framework significantly improves localization performance compared to the supervised learning-based approach in terms of floor-level coordinate estimation using EvAAL metric. It shows enhancements up to 10.99% and 8.98% in the former scenario and 4.25% and 9.35% in the latter, respectively with additional studies highlight the importance of the essential components of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Rumyantsev, Pavel Yakovlev, Andrey Gorshkov, Andrey P. Sokolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling vast amounts of data is crucial in today's world. The growth of high-performance computing has created a need for parallelization, particularly in the area of machine learning algorithms such as ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbors). To improve the speed of these algorithms, it is important to optimize them for specific processor architectures. RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computer Five) is one of the modern processor architectures, which features a vector instruction set called RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). In machine learning algorithms, vector extensions are widely utilized to improve the processing of voluminous data. This study examines the effectiveness of applying RVV to commonly used ANN algorithms. The algorithms were adapted for RISC-V and optimized using RVV after identifying the primary bottlenecks. Additionally, we developed a theoretical model of a parameterized vector block and identified the best on average configuration that demonstrates the highest theoretical performance of the studied ANN algorithms when the other CPU parameters are fixed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pingjie Wang, Ziqing Fan, Shengchao Hu, Zhe Chen, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured pruning is a promising hardware-friendly compression technique for large language models (LLMs), which is expected to be retraining-free to avoid the enormous retraining cost. This retraining-free paradigm involves (1) pruning criteria to define the architecture and (2) distortion reconstruction to restore performance. However, existing methods often emphasize pruning criteria while using reconstruction techniques that are specific to certain modules or criteria, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this, we introduce the Linear Interpolation-based Adaptive Reconstruction (LIAR) framework, which is both efficient and effective. LIAR does not require back-propagation or retraining and is compatible with various pruning criteria and modules. By applying linear interpolation to the preserved weights, LIAR minimizes reconstruction error and effectively reconstructs the pruned output. Our evaluations on benchmarks such as GLUE, SQuAD, WikiText, and common sense reasoning show that LIAR enables a BERT model to maintain 98% accuracy even after removing 50% of its parameters and achieves top performance for LLaMA in just a few minutes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo De Santi, Federico Arangath Joseph, Noah Liniger, Mirco Mutti, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: How can a scientist use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to design experiments over a dynamical system's state space? In the case of finite and Markovian systems, an area called Active Exploration (AE) relaxes the optimization problem of experiments design into Convex RL, a generalization of RL admitting a wider notion of reward. Unfortunately, this framework is currently not scalable and the potential of AE is hindered by the vastness of experiment spaces typical of scientific discovery applications. However, these spaces are often endowed with natural geometries, e.g., permutation invariance in molecular design, that an agent could leverage to improve the statistical and computational efficiency of AE. To achieve this, we bridge AE and MDP homomorphisms, which offer a way to exploit known geometric structures via abstraction. Towards this goal, we make two fundamental contributions: we extend MDP homomorphisms formalism to Convex RL, and we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis that formally captures the benefit of abstraction via homomorphisms on sample efficiency. Ultimately, we propose the Geometric Active Exploration (GAE) algorithm, which we analyse theoretically and experimentally in environments motivated by problems in scientific discovery.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding spatial configurations of multiple objects in images, e.g., a mobile inspection robot is tasked to localize abandoned tools on the floor. We define the spatial configuration of objects by first-order logic in terms of relations and attributes. A neuro-symbolic program matches the logic formulas to probabilistic object proposals for the given image, provided by language-vision models by querying them for the symbols. This work is the first to combine neuro-symbolic programming (reasoning) and language-vision models (learning) to find spatial configurations of objects in images in an open world setting. We show the effectiveness by finding abandoned tools on floors and leaking pipes. We find that most prediction errors are due to biases in the language-vision model.</p>

Better acquisition policies can reduce costs while maintaining or even improving the performance of downstream predictors. Inspired by the maximization of conditional mutual information, we propose an approach to train acquirers end-to-end using only the downstream loss.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Yao, Shengchao Yan, Daniel Goehring, Wolfram Burgard, Joerg Reichardt</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples is a key performance indicator of a trajectory prediction model. However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Do different generative image models secretly learn similar underlying representations? We investigate this by measuring the latent space similarity of four different models: VAEs, GANs, Normalizing Flows (NFs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Our methodology involves training linear maps between frozen latent spaces to "stitch" arbitrary pairs of encoders and decoders and measuring output-based and probe-based metrics on the resulting "stitched'' models. Our main findings are that linear maps between latent spaces of performant models preserve most visual information even when latent sizes differ; for CelebA models, gender is the most similarly represented probe-able attribute. Finally we show on an NF that latent space representations converge early in training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carolin Benjamins, Gjorgjina Cenikj, Ana Nikolikj, Aditya Mohan, Tome Eftimov, Marius Lindauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic Algorithm Configuration (DAC) addresses the challenge of dynamically setting hyperparameters of an algorithm for a diverse set of instances rather than focusing solely on individual tasks. Agents trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer a pathway to solve such settings. However, the limited generalization performance of these agents has significantly hindered the application in DAC. Our hypothesis is that a potential bias in the training instances limits generalization capabilities. We take a step towards mitigating this by selecting a representative subset of training instances to overcome overrepresentation and then retraining the agent on this subset to improve its generalization performance. For constructing the meta-features for the subset selection, we particularly account for the dynamic nature of the RL agent by computing time series features on trajectories of actions and rewards generated by the agent's interaction with the environment. Through empirical evaluations on the Sigmoid and CMA-ES benchmarks from the standard benchmark library for DAC, called DACBench, we discuss the potentials of our selection technique compared to training on the entire instance set. Our results highlight the efficacy of instance selection in refining DAC policies for diverse instance spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrey Gorodetskiy, Konstantin Mironov, Aleksandr Panov</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of learning-based control methods in robotics presents significant challenges. One is that model-free reinforcement learning algorithms use observation data with low sample efficiency. To address this challenge, a prevalent approach is model-based reinforcement learning, which involves employing an environment dynamics model. We suggest approximating transition dynamics with symbolic expressions, which are generated via symbolic regression. Approximation of a mechanical system with a symbolic model has fewer parameters than approximation with neural networks, which can potentially lead to higher accuracy and quality of extrapolation. We use a symbolic dynamics model to generate trajectories in model-based policy optimization to improve the sample efficiency of the learning algorithm. We evaluate our approach across various tasks within simulated environments. Our method demonstrates superior sample efficiency in these tasks compared to model-free and model-based baseline methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Kumar Singh, Rudra Murthy, Vishwajeet kumar, Jaydeep Sen, Ganesh Ramakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in unseen tasks, including context-grounded question answering (QA) in English. However, the evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in non-English languages for context-based QA is limited by the scarcity of benchmarks in non-English languages. To address this gap, we introduce Indic-QA, the largest publicly available context-grounded question-answering dataset for 11 major Indian languages from two language families. The dataset comprises both extractive and abstractive question-answering tasks and includes existing datasets as well as English QA datasets translated into Indian languages. Additionally, we generate a synthetic dataset using the Gemini model to create question-answer pairs given a passage, which is then manually verified for quality assurance. We evaluate various multilingual Large Language Models and their instruction-fine-tuned variants on the benchmark and observe that their performance is subpar, particularly for low-resource languages. We hope that the release of this dataset will stimulate further research on the question-answering abilities of LLMs for low-resource languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Process Outcome Prediction entails predicting a discrete property of an unfinished process instance from its partial trace. High-capacity outcome predictors discovered with ensemble and deep learning methods have been shown to achieve top accuracy performances, but they suffer from a lack of transparency. Aligning with recent efforts to learn inherently interpretable outcome predictors, we propose to train a sparse Mixture-of-Experts where both the ``gate'' and ``expert'' sub-nets are Logistic Regressors. This ensemble-like model is trained end-to-end while automatically selecting a subset of input features in each sub-net, as an alternative to the common approach of performing a global feature selection step prior to model training. Test results on benchmark logs confirmed the validity and efficacy of this approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study examines the performance of item-based k-Nearest Neighbors (ItemKNN) algorithms in the RecBole and LensKit recommender system libraries. Using four data sets (Anime, Modcloth, ML-100K, and ML-1M), we assess each library's efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, focusing primarily on normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG). Our results show that RecBole outperforms LensKit on two of three metrics on the ML-100K data set: it achieved an 18% higher nDCG, 14% higher precision, and 35% lower recall. To ensure a fair comparison, we adjusted LensKit's nDCG calculation to match RecBole's method. This alignment made the performance more comparable, with LensKit achieving an nDCG of 0.2540 and RecBole 0.2674. Differences in similarity matrix calculations were identified as the main cause of performance deviations. After modifying LensKit to retain only the top K similar items, both libraries showed nearly identical nDCG values across all data sets. For instance, both achieved an nDCG of 0.2586 on the ML-1M data set with the same random seed. Initially, LensKit's original implementation only surpassed RecBole in the ModCloth dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-resolution time series data are crucial for operation and planning in energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. However, due to data collection costs and privacy concerns, such data is often unavailable or insufficient for downstream tasks. Data synthesis is a potential solution for this data scarcity. With the recent development of generative AI, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. Additionally, EnergyDiff consistently generates high-quality time series data across diverse energy domains, time resolutions, and at both customer and transformer levels with reduced computational need.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nils Palumbo, Ravi Mangal, Zifan Wang, Saranya Vijayakumar, Corina S. Pasareanu, Somesh Jha</p>
<p>Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse engineer the computation performed by a neural network in terms of its internal components. Although there is a growing body of research on mechanistic interpretation of neural networks, the notion of a mechanistic interpretation itself is often ad-hoc. Inspired by the notion of abstract interpretation from the program analysis literature that aims to develop approximate semantics for programs, we give a set of axioms that formally characterize a mechanistic interpretation as a description that approximately captures the semantics of the neural network under analysis in a compositional manner. We use these axioms to guide the mechanistic interpretability analysis of a Transformer-based model trained to solve the well-known 2-SAT problem. We are able to reverse engineer the algorithm learned by the model -- the model first parses the input formulas and then evaluates their satisfiability via enumeration of different possible valuations of the Boolean input variables. We also present evidence to support that the mechanistic interpretation of the analyzed model indeed satisfies the stated axioms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Jiang, Tong Chen, Guanhua Ye, Wentao Zhang, Lizhen Cui, Zi Huang, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban flow prediction is a spatio-temporal modeling task that estimates the throughput of transportation services like buses, taxis, and ride-sharing, where data-driven models have become the most popular solution in the past decade. Meanwhile, the implicitly learned mapping between historical observations to the prediction targets tend to over-simplify the dynamics of real-world urban flows, leading to suboptimal predictions. Some recent spatio-temporal prediction solutions bring remedies with the notion of physics-guided machine learning (PGML), which describes spatio-temporal data with nuanced and principled physics laws, thus enhancing both the prediction accuracy and interpretability. However, these spatio-temporal PGML methods are built upon a strong assumption that the observed data fully conforms to the differential equations that define the physical system, which can quickly become ill-posed in urban flow prediction tasks. The observed urban flow data, especially when sliced into time-dependent snapshots to facilitate predictions, is typically incomplete and sparse, and prone to inherent noise incurred in the collection process. As a result, such physical inconsistency between the data and PGML model significantly limits the predictive power and robustness of the solution. Moreover, due to the interval-based predictions and intermittent nature of data filing in many transportation services, the instantaneous dynamics of urban flows can hardly be captured, rendering differential equation-based continuous modeling a loose fit for this setting. To overcome the challenges, we develop a discretized physics-guided network (PN), and propose a data-aware framework Physics-guided Active Sample Reweighting (P-GASR) to enhance PN. Experimental results in four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a demonstrable improvement in robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training data privacy is a fundamental problem in modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as face recognition, recommendation systems, language generation, and many others, as it may contain sensitive user information related to legal issues. To fundamentally understand how privacy mechanisms work in AI applications, we study differential privacy (DP) in the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regression setting, where DP is one of the most powerful tools for measuring privacy under statistical learning, and NTK is one of the most popular analysis frameworks for studying the learning mechanisms of deep neural networks. In our work, we can show provable guarantees for both differential privacy and test accuracy of our NTK regression. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on the basic image classification dataset CIFAR10 to demonstrate that NTK regression can preserve good accuracy under a modest privacy budget, supporting the validity of our analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a DP guarantee for NTK regression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ally Yalei Du, Lin F. Yang, Ruosong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent work by Dong & Yang (2023) showed for misspecified sparse linear bandits, one can obtain an $O\left(\epsilon\right)$-optimal policy using a polynomial number of samples when the sparsity is a constant, where $\epsilon$ is the misspecification error. This result is in sharp contrast to misspecified linear bandits without sparsity, which require an exponential number of samples to get the same guarantee. In order to study whether the analog result is possible in the reinforcement learning setting, we consider the following problem: assuming the optimal $Q$-function is a $d$-dimensional linear function with sparsity $k$ and misspecification error $\epsilon$, whether we can obtain an $O\left(\epsilon\right)$-optimal policy using number of samples polynomially in the feature dimension $d$. We first demonstrate why the standard approach based on Bellman backup or the existing optimistic value function elimination approach such as OLIVE (Jiang et al., 2017) achieves suboptimal guarantees for this problem. We then design a novel elimination-based algorithm to show one can obtain an $O\left(H\epsilon\right)$-optimal policy with sample complexity polynomially in the feature dimension $d$ and planning horizon $H$. Lastly, we complement our upper bound with an $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(H\epsilon\right)$ suboptimality lower bound, giving a complete picture of this problem.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13664">Decision Focused Causal Learning for Direct Counterfactual Marketing Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhou, Rongxiao Huang, Shaoming Li, Guibin Jiang, Jiaqi Zheng, Bing Cheng, Wei Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Marketing optimization plays an important role to enhance user engagement in online Internet platforms. Existing studies usually formulate this problem as a budget allocation problem and solve it by utilizing two fully decoupled stages, i.e., machine learning (ML) and operation research (OR). However, the learning objective in ML does not take account of the downstream optimization task in OR, which causes that the prediction accuracy in ML may be not positively related to the decision quality.
  Decision Focused Learning (DFL) integrates ML and OR into an end-to-end framework, which takes the objective of the downstream task as the decision loss function and guarantees the consistency of the optimization direction between ML and OR. However, deploying DFL in marketing is non-trivial due to multiple technological challenges. Firstly, the budget allocation problem in marketing is a 0-1 integer stochastic programming problem and the budget is uncertain and fluctuates a lot in real-world settings, which is beyond the general problem background in DFL. Secondly, the counterfactual in marketing causes that the decision loss cannot be directly computed and the optimal solution can never be obtained, both of which disable the common gradient-estimation approaches in DFL. Thirdly, the OR solver is called frequently to compute the decision loss during model training in DFL, which produces huge computational cost and cannot support large-scale training data. In this paper, we propose a decision focused causal learning framework (DFCL) for direct counterfactual marketing optimization, which overcomes the above technological challenges. Both offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness of DFCL over the state-of-the-art methods. Currently, DFCL has been deployed in several marketing scenarios in Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery platform in the world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial but challenging task in many high-dimensional regression or learning problems to increase the confidence of a given predictor. We develop a new data-driven approach for UQ in regression that applies both to classical regression approaches such as the LASSO as well as to neural networks. One of the most notable UQ techniques is the debiased LASSO, which modifies the LASSO to allow for the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals by decomposing the estimation error into a Gaussian and an asymptotically vanishing bias component. However, in real-world problems with finite-dimensional data, the bias term is often too significant to be neglected, resulting in overly narrow confidence intervals. Our work rigorously addresses this issue and derives a data-driven adjustment that corrects the confidence intervals for a large class of predictors by estimating the means and variances of the bias terms from training data, exploiting high-dimensional concentration phenomena. This gives rise to non-asymptotic confidence intervals, which can help avoid overestimating uncertainty in critical applications such as MRI diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis extends beyond sparse regression to data-driven predictors like neural networks, enhancing the reliability of model-based deep learning. Our findings bridge the gap between established theory and the practical applicability of such debiased methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tristan Cinquin, Marvin Pf\"ortner, Vincent Fortuin, Philipp Hennig, Robert Bamler</p>
<p>Abstract: Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the neural network, and they scale to large models and datasets. While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we have to recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant, e.g., in many scientific inference tasks. At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box regression and classification tasks where neural networks typically excel.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13722">Enhanced $H$-Consistency Bounds</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anqi Mao, Mehryar Mohri, Yutao Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has introduced a key notion of $H$-consistency bounds for surrogate losses. These bounds offer finite-sample guarantees, quantifying the relationship between the zero-one estimation error (or other target loss) and the surrogate loss estimation error for a specific hypothesis set. However, previous bounds were derived under the condition that a lower bound of the surrogate loss conditional regret is given as a convex function of the target conditional regret, without non-constant factors depending on the predictor or input instance. Can we derive finer and more favorable $H$-consistency bounds? In this work, we relax this condition and present a general framework for establishing enhanced $H$-consistency bounds based on more general inequalities relating conditional regrets. Our theorems not only subsume existing results as special cases but also enable the derivation of more favorable bounds in various scenarios. These include standard multi-class classification, binary and multi-class classification under Tsybakov noise conditions, and bipartite ranking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anqi Mao, Mehryar Mohri, Yutao Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of surrogate loss functions for learning to defer. We introduce a broad family of surrogate losses, parameterized by a non-increasing function $\Psi$, and establish their realizable $H$-consistency under mild conditions. For cost functions based on classification error, we further show that these losses admit $H$-consistency bounds when the hypothesis set is symmetric and complete, a property satisfied by common neural network and linear function hypothesis sets. Our results also resolve an open question raised in previous work (Mozannar et al., 2023) by proving the realizable $H$-consistency and Bayes-consistency of a specific surrogate loss. Furthermore, we identify choices of $\Psi$ that lead to $H$-consistent surrogate losses for any general cost function, thus achieving Bayes-consistency, realizable $H$-consistency, and $H$-consistency bounds simultaneously. We also investigate the relationship between $H$-consistency bounds and realizable $H$-consistency in learning to defer, highlighting key differences from standard classification. Finally, we empirically evaluate our proposed surrogate losses and compare them with existing baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masatoshi Uehara, Yulai Zhao, Tommaso Biancalani, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: This tutorial provides a comprehensive survey of methods for fine-tuning diffusion models to optimize downstream reward functions. While diffusion models are widely known to provide excellent generative modeling capability, practical applications in domains such as biology require generating samples that maximize some desired metric (e.g., translation efficiency in RNA, docking score in molecules, stability in protein). In these cases, the diffusion model can be optimized not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly maximize the measure of interest. Such methods are based on concepts from reinforcement learning (RL). We explain the application of various RL algorithms, including PPO, differentiable optimization, reward-weighted MLE, value-weighted sampling, and path consistency learning, tailored specifically for fine-tuning diffusion models. We aim to explore fundamental aspects such as the strengths and limitations of different RL-based fine-tuning algorithms across various scenarios, the benefits of RL-based fine-tuning compared to non-RL-based approaches, and the formal objectives of RL-based fine-tuning (target distributions). Additionally, we aim to examine their connections with related topics such as classifier guidance, Gflownets, flow-based diffusion models, path integral control theory, and sampling from unnormalized distributions such as MCMC.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13743">Optimistic Q-learning for average reward and episodic reinforcement learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyank Agrawal, Shipra Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: We present an optimistic Q-learning algorithm for regret minimization in average reward reinforcement learning under an additional assumption on the underlying MDP that for all policies, the expected time to visit some frequent state $s_0$ is finite and upper bounded by $H$. Our setting strictly generalizes the episodic setting and is significantly less restrictive than the assumption of bounded hitting time {\it for all states} made by most previous literature on model-free algorithms in average reward settings. We demonstrate a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H^5 S\sqrt{AT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, and $T$ is the horizon. A key technical novelty of our work is to introduce an $\overline{L}$ operator defined as $\overline{L} v = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^H L^h v$ where $L$ denotes the Bellman operator. We show that under the given assumption, the $\overline{L}$ operator has a strict contraction (in span) even in the average reward setting. Our algorithm design then uses ideas from episodic Q-learning to estimate and apply this operator iteratively. Therefore, we provide a unified view of regret minimization in episodic and non-episodic settings that may be of independent interest.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13746">Multi-Label Learning with Stronger Consistency Guarantees</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anqi Mao, Mehryar Mohri, Yutao Zhong</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a detailed study of surrogate losses and algorithms for multi-label learning, supported by $H$-consistency bounds. We first show that, for the simplest form of multi-label loss (the popular Hamming loss), the well-known consistent binary relevance surrogate suffers from a sub-optimal dependency on the number of labels in terms of $H$-consistency bounds, when using smooth losses such as logistic losses. Furthermore, this loss function fails to account for label correlations. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a novel surrogate loss, multi-label logistic loss, that accounts for label correlations and benefits from label-independent $H$-consistency bounds. We then broaden our analysis to cover a more extensive family of multi-label losses, including all common ones and a new extension defined based on linear-fractional functions with respect to the confusion matrix. We also extend our multi-label logistic losses to more comprehensive multi-label comp-sum losses, adapting comp-sum losses from standard classification to the multi-label learning. We prove that this family of surrogate losses benefits from $H$-consistency bounds, and thus Bayes-consistency, across any general multi-label loss. Our work thus proposes a unified surrogate loss framework benefiting from strong consistency guarantees for any multi-label loss, significantly expanding upon previous work which only established Bayes-consistency and for specific loss functions. Additionally, we adapt constrained losses from standard classification to multi-label constrained losses in a similar way, which also benefit from $H$-consistency bounds and thus Bayes-consistency for any multi-label loss. We further describe efficient gradient computation algorithms for minimizing the multi-label logistic loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Srinath Mahankali, Zhang-Wei Hong, Ayush Sekhari, Alexander Rakhlin, Pulkit Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to efficiently explore high-dimensional state spaces is essential for the practical success of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). This paper introduces a new exploration technique called Random Latent Exploration (RLE), that combines the strengths of bonus-based and noise-based (two popular approaches for effective exploration in deep RL) exploration strategies. RLE leverages the idea of perturbing rewards by adding structured random rewards to the original task rewards in certain (random) states of the environment, to encourage the agent to explore the environment during training. RLE is straightforward to implement and performs well in practice. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of RLE, we evaluate it on the challenging Atari and IsaacGym benchmarks and show that RLE exhibits higher overall scores across all the tasks than other approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurens Engwegen, Daan Brinks, Wendelin B\"ohmer</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel imaging and neurostimulation techniques open doors for advancements in closed-loop control of activity in biological neural networks. This would allow for applications in the investigation of activity propagation, and for diagnosis and treatment of pathological behaviour. Due to the partially observable characteristics of activity propagation, through networks in which edges can not be observed, and the dynamic nature of neuronal systems, there is a need for adaptive, generalisable control. In this paper, we introduce an environment that procedurally generates neuronal networks with different topologies to investigate this generalisation problem. Additionally, an existing transformer-based architecture is adjusted to evaluate the generalisation performance of a deep RL agent in the presented partially observable environment. The agent demonstrates the capability to generalise control from a limited number of training networks to unseen test networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Query rewrite systems perform graph substitutions using rewrite rules to generate optimal SQL query plans. Rewriting logical and physical relational query plans is proven to be an NP-hard sequential decision-making problem with a search space exponential in the number of rewrite rules. In this paper, we address the query rewrite problem by interleaving Equality Saturation and Graph Reinforcement Learning (RL). The proposed system, Aurora, rewrites relational queries by guiding Equality Saturation, a method from compiler literature to perform non-destructive graph rewriting, with a novel RL agent that embeds both the spatial structure of the query graph as well as the temporal dimension associated with the sequential construction of query plans. Our results show Graph Reinforcement Learning for non-destructive graph rewriting yields SQL plans orders of magnitude faster than existing equality saturation solvers, while also achieving competitive results against mainstream query optimisers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online Large Language Model (LLM) services such as ChatGPT and Claude 3 have transformed business operations and academic research by effortlessly enabling new opportunities. However, due to data-sharing restrictions, sectors such as healthcare and finance prefer to deploy local LLM applications using costly hardware resources. This scenario requires a balance between the effectiveness advantages of LLMs and significant financial burdens. Additionally, the rapid evolution of models increases the frequency and redundancy of benchmarking efforts. Existing benchmarking toolkits, which typically focus on effectiveness, often overlook economic considerations, making their findings less applicable to practical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce CEBench, an open-source toolkit specifically designed for multi-objective benchmarking that focuses on the critical trade-offs between expenditure and effectiveness required for LLM deployments. CEBench allows for easy modifications through configuration files, enabling stakeholders to effectively assess and optimize these trade-offs. This strategic capability supports crucial decision-making processes aimed at maximizing effectiveness while minimizing cost impacts. By streamlining the evaluation process and emphasizing cost-effectiveness, CEBench seeks to facilitate the development of economically viable AI solutions across various industries and research fields.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Yang (Jack), Gopi Krishnan Rajbahadur (Jack), Dayi Lin (Jack), Shaowei Wang (Jack), Zhen Ming (Jack),  Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data clones are defined as multiple copies of the same data among datasets. Presence of data clones between datasets can cause issues such as difficulties in managing data assets and data license violations when using datasets with clones to build AI software. However, detecting data clones is not trivial. Majority of the prior studies in this area rely on structural information to detect data clones (e.g., font size, column header). However, tabular datasets used to build AI software are typically stored without any structural information. In this paper, we propose a novel method called SimClone for data clone detection in tabular datasets without relying on structural information. SimClone method utilizes value similarities for data clone detection. We also propose a visualization approach as a part of our SimClone method to help locate the exact position of the cloned data between a dataset pair. Our results show that our SimClone outperforms the current state-of-the-art method by at least 20\% in terms of both F1-score and AUC. In addition, SimClone's visualization component helps identify the exact location of the data clone in a dataset with a Precision@10 value of 0.80 in the top 20 true positive predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models are transforming the ways that their users engage with the world. Despite impressive capabilities, over-consumption of language model outputs risks propagating unchecked errors in the short-term and damaging human capabilities for critical thinking in the long-term, particularly in knowledge-based tasks. How can we develop scaffolding around language models to curate more appropriate use? We propose selective frictions for language model experiences, inspired by behavioral science interventions, to dampen misuse. Frictions involve small modifications to a user's experience, e.g., the addition of a button impeding model access and reminding a user of their expertise relative to the model. Through a user study with real humans, we observe shifts in user behavior from the imposition of a friction over LLMs in the context of a multi-topic question-answering task as a representative task that people may use LLMs for, e.g., in education and information retrieval. We find that frictions modulate over-reliance by driving down users' click rates while minimally affecting accuracy for those topics. Yet, frictions may have unintended effects. We find marked differences in users' click behaviors even on topics where frictions were not provisioned. Our contributions motivate further study of human-AI behavioral interaction to inform more effective and appropriate LLM use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anjali Rawal, Hui Wang, Youjia Zheng, Yu-Hsuan Lin, Shanu Sushmita</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their ability to mimic human language. Identifying texts generated by LLMs is crucial for understanding their capabilities and mitigating potential consequences. This paper analyzes datasets of varying text lengths: small, medium, and large. We compare the performance of machine learning algorithms on four datasets: (1) small (tweets from Election, FIFA, and Game of Thrones), (2) medium (Wikipedia introductions and PubMed abstracts), and (3) large (OpenAI web text dataset). Our results indicate that LLMs with very large parameters (such as the XL-1542 variant of GPT2 with 1542 million parameters) were harder (74%) to detect using traditional machine learning methods. However, detecting texts of varying lengths from LLMs with smaller parameters (762 million or less) can be done with high accuracy (96% and above). We examine the characteristics of human and machine-generated texts across multiple dimensions, including linguistics, personality, sentiment, bias, and morality. Our findings indicate that machine-generated texts generally have higher readability and closely mimic human moral judgments but differ in personality traits. SVM and Voting Classifier (VC) models consistently achieve high performance across most datasets, while Decision Tree (DT) models show the lowest performance. Model performance drops when dealing with rephrased texts, particularly shorter texts like tweets. This study underscores the challenges and importance of detecting LLM-generated texts and suggests directions for future research to improve detection methods and understand the nuanced capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Is it still worth doing computer networking research? What are relevant problems in this space given the supremacy of hyperscalers in deployed large networks? We take an unconventional approach to finding relevant research directions, by starting from Microsoft's plans to build a $100 billion datacenter for ML. Our goal is to understand what models could be trained in such a datacenter, as well as the high-level challenges one may encounter in doing so.
  We first examine the constraints imposed by cooling and power requirements for our target datacenter and find that it is infeasible to build in a single location. We use LLM scaling laws to determine that we could train models of 50T or 100T. Finally, we examine how distributed training might work for these models, and what the networking requirements are. We conclude that building the datacenter and training such models is technically possible, but this requires a novel NIC-based multipath transport along with a redesign of the entire training stack, outlining a research agenda for our community in the near future.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to evolve, the context length in inference is steadily growing. Key-Value Cache (KVCache), a crucial component in LLM inference, has now become the primary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods selectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation in LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining model quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from advanced embedding retrieval techniques used in the database community, we consider the storage and searching of KVCache as a typical embedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product Quantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring low serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys for each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, for each newly generated token, we first identify important tokens through Maximum Inner-Product Search (MIPS) using PQ codes and centroids, then fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation. Through meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any additional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive experiments show that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and efficiency. It maintains model quality even when only 1/5 of the tokens are involved in attention, while attaining acceptable system latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in understanding complex natural language. One important application of LLM is LLM-based AI Agent, which leverages the ability of LLM as well as external tools for complex-task solving. To make sure LLM Agents follow an effective and reliable procedure to solve the given task, manually designed workflows are usually used to guide the working mechanism of agents. However, manually designing the workflows requires considerable efforts and domain knowledge, making it difficult to develop and deploy agents on massive scales. To address these issues, we propose AutoFlow, a framework designed to automatically generate workflows for agents to solve complex tasks. AutoFlow takes natural language program as the format of agent workflow and employs a workflow optimization procedure to iteratively optimize the workflow quality. Besides, this work offers two workflow generation methods: fine-tuning-based and in-context-based methods, making the AutoFlow framework applicable to both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Experimental results show that our framework can produce robust and reliable agent workflows. We believe that the automatic generation and interpretation of workflows in natural language represent a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks, particularly with the rapid development of LLMs. The source code of this work is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/AutoFlow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjie Li, Yinhao Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression, a prevalent and serious mental health issue, affects approximately 3.8\% of the global population. Despite the existence of effective treatments, over 75\% of individuals in low- and middle-income countries remain untreated, partly due to the challenge in accurately diagnosing depression in its early stages. This paper introduces a novel method for detecting depression based on multi-modal feature fusion utilizing cross-attention. By employing MacBERT as a pre-training model to extract lexical features from text and incorporating an additional Transformer module to refine task-specific contextual understanding, the model's adaptability to the targeted task is enhanced. Diverging from previous practices of simply concatenating multimodal features, this approach leverages cross-attention for feature integration, significantly improving the accuracy in depression detection and enabling a more comprehensive and precise analysis of user emotions and behaviors. Furthermore, a Multi-Modal Feature Fusion Network based on Cross-Attention (MFFNC) is constructed, demonstrating exceptional performance in the task of depression identification. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an accuracy of 0.9495 on the test dataset, marking a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Moreover, it outlines a promising methodology for other social media platforms and tasks involving multi-modal processing. Timely identification and intervention for individuals with depression are crucial for saving lives, highlighting the immense potential of technology in facilitating early intervention for mental health issues.</p>

Our solution is mainly based on two methods, BERT and GCN, and combines the reasoning results of BERT and GCN in the final submission to achieve complementary performance. In the BERT solution, we focus on processing the fragments that appear in the references of the paper, and use a variety of operations to reduce the redundant interference in the fragments, so that the information received by BERT is more refined. In the GCN solution, we map information such as paper fragments, abstracts, and titles to a high-dimensional semantic space through an embedding model, and try to build edges between titles, abstracts, and fragments to integrate contextual relationships for judgment. In the end, our solution achieved a remarkable score of 0.47691 in the competition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Sathiesh Rajan, Ezekiel Soremekun, Sudipta Chattopadhyay</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we systematically expose and measure the inconsistency and knowledge gaps of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose an automated testing framework (called KONTEST) which leverages a knowledge graph to construct test cases. KONTEST probes and measures the inconsistencies in the LLM's knowledge of the world via a combination of semantically-equivalent queries and test oracles (metamorphic or ontological oracle). KONTEST further mitigates knowledge gaps via a weighted LLM model ensemble. Using four state-of-the-art LLMs (Falcon, Gemini, GPT3.5, and Llama2), we show that KONTEST generates 19.2% error inducing inputs (1917 errors from 9983 test inputs). It also reveals a 16.5% knowledge gap across all tested LLMs. KONTEST's mitigation method reduces LLM knowledge gap by 32.48%. Our ablation study further shows that GPT3.5 is not suitable for knowledge-based consistency testing because it is only 60%-68% effective in knowledge construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Irina Abdullaeva, Andrei Filatov, Mikhail Orlov, Ivan Karpukhin, Viacheslav Vasilev, Denis Dimitrov, Andrey Kuznetsov, Ivan Kireev, Andrey Savchenko</p>
<p>Abstract: Event sequences (ESs) arise in many practical domains including finance, retail, social networks, and healthcare. In the context of machine learning, event sequences can be seen as a special type of tabular data with annotated timestamps. Despite the importance of ESs modeling and analysis, little effort was made in adapting large language models (LLMs) to the ESs domain. In this paper, we highlight the common difficulties of ESs processing and propose a novel solution capable of solving multiple downstream tasks with little or no finetuning. In particular, we solve the problem of working with long sequences and improve time and numeric features processing. The resulting method, called ESQA, effectively utilizes the power of LLMs and, according to extensive experiments, achieves state-of-the-art results in the ESs domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Gr\"onquist</p>
<p>Abstract: The digital revolution and the advent of the world wide web have transformed human communication, notably through the emergence of memes. While memes are a popular and straightforward form of expression, they can also be used to spread misinformation and hate due to their anonymity and ease of use. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a solution developed by team 'Baseline' for the AI Singapore Online Safety Prize Challenge. Focusing on computational efficiency and feature engineering, the solution achieved an AUROC of 0.76 and an accuracy of 0.69 on the test dataset. As key features, the solution leverages the inherent probabilistic capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate task-adapted feature encodings from text, and applies a distilled quantization tailored to the specific cultural nuances present in Singapore. This type of processing and fine-tuning can be adapted to various visual and textual understanding and classification tasks, and even applied on private VLMs such as OpenAI's GPT. Finally it can eliminate the need for extensive model training on large GPUs for resource constrained applications, also offering a solution when little or no data is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Kipnis, Konstantinos Voudouris, Luca M. Schulze Buschoff, Eric Schulz</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary in their abilities on a range of tasks. Initiatives such as the $\texttt{Open LLM Leaderboard}$ aim to quantify these differences with several large benchmarks (sets of test items to which an LLM can respond either correctly or incorrectly). However, high correlations within and between benchmark scores suggest that (1) there exists a small set of common underlying abilities that these benchmarks measure, and (2) items tap into redundant information and the benchmarks may thus be considerably compressed. We use data from $n > 5000$ LLMs to identify the most informative items of six benchmarks, ARC, GSM8K, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA and WinoGrande (with $d=28,632$ items in total). From them we distill a sparse benchmark, $\texttt{metabench}$, that has less than $3\%$ of the original size of all six benchmarks combined. This new sparse benchmark goes beyond point scores by yielding estimators of the underlying benchmark-specific abilities. We show that these estimators (1) can be used to reconstruct each original $\textit{individual}$ benchmark score with, on average, $1.5\%$ root mean square error (RMSE), (2) reconstruct the original $\textit{total}$ score with $0.8\%$ RMSE, and (3) have a single underlying common factor whose Spearman correlation with the total score is $r = 0.93$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bumjin Park, Jaesik Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize text from several sources of documents. In pretraining, LLM trains to maximize the likelihood of text but neither receives the source of the text nor memorizes the source. Accordingly, LLM can not provide document information on the generated content, and users do not obtain any hint of reliability, which is crucial for factuality or privacy infringement. This work introduces token-level source identification in the decoding step, which maps the token representation to the reference document. We propose a bi-gram source identifier, a multi-layer perceptron with two successive token representations as input for better generalization. We conduct extensive experiments on Wikipedia and PG19 datasets with several LLMs, layer locations, and identifier sizes. The overall results show a possibility of token-level source identifiers for tracing the document, a crucial problem for the safe use of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mina Remeli, Moritz Hardt, Robert C. Williamson</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the predictability of online speech on social media, and whether predictability improves with information outside a user's own posts. Recent work suggests that the predictive information contained in posts written by a user's peers can surpass that of the user's own posts. Motivated by the success of large language models, we empirically test this hypothesis. We define unpredictability as a measure of the model's uncertainty, i.e., its negative log-likelihood on future tokens given context. As the basis of our study, we collect a corpus of 6.25M posts from more than five thousand X (previously Twitter) users and their peers. Across three large language models ranging in size from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, we find that predicting a user's posts from their peers' posts performs poorly. Moreover, the value of the user's own posts for prediction is consistently higher than that of their peers'. Across the board, we find that the predictability of social media posts remains low, comparable to predicting financial news without context. We extend our investigation with a detailed analysis about the causes of unpredictability and the robustness of our findings. Specifically, we observe that a significant amount of predictive uncertainty comes from hashtags and @-mentions. Moreover, our results replicate if instead of prompting the model with additional context, we finetune on additional context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rulin Shao, Jacqueline He, Akari Asai, Weijia Shi, Tim Dettmers, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Pang Wei Koh</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws with respect to the amount of training data and the number of parameters allow us to predict the cost-benefit trade-offs of pretraining language models (LMs) in different configurations. In this paper, we consider another dimension of scaling: the amount of data available at inference time. Specifically, we find that increasing the size of the datastore used by a retrieval-based LM monotonically improves language modeling and several downstream tasks without obvious saturation, such that a smaller model augmented with a large datastore outperforms a larger LM-only model on knowledge-intensive tasks. By plotting compute-optimal scaling curves with varied datastore, model, and pretraining data sizes, we show that using larger datastores can significantly improve model performance for the same training compute budget. We carry out our study by constructing a 1.4 trillion-token datastore named MassiveDS, which is the largest and the most diverse open-sourced datastore for retrieval-based LMs to date, and designing an efficient pipeline for studying datastore scaling in a computationally accessible manner. Finally, we analyze the effect of improving the retriever, datastore quality filtering, and other design choices on our observed scaling trends. Overall, our results show that datastore size should be considered as an integral part of LM efficiency and performance trade-offs. To facilitate future research, we open-source our datastore and code at https://github.com/RulinShao/retrieval-scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steffen Herbold, Alexander Trautsch, Zlata Kikteva, Annette Hautli-Janisz</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI technology like Large language models (LLMs) has the potential to pollute the public information sphere with made-up content, which poses a significant threat to the cohesion of societies at large. A wide range of research has shown that LLMs are capable of generating text of impressive quality, including persuasive political speech, text with a pre-defined style, and role-specific content. But there is a crucial gap in the literature: We lack large-scale and systematic studies of how capable LLMs are in impersonating political and societal representatives and how the general public judges these impersonations in terms of authenticity, relevance and coherence. We present the results of a study based on a cross-section of British society that shows that LLMs are able to generate responses to debate questions that were part of a broadcast political debate programme in the UK. The impersonated responses are judged to be more authentic and relevant than the original responses given by people who were impersonated. This shows two things: (1) LLMs can be made to contribute meaningfully to the public political debate and (2) there is a dire need to inform the general public of the potential harm this can have on society.</p>

Utilizing a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely-used LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT4, in binary-choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based agents selecting between products and academic papers described either by humans or LLMs under identical conditions. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-generated content. This suggests the possibility of AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans, giving AI agents an unfair advantage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the dynamic graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the dynamic graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingli Liao, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly in contexts where computational resources are limited. Traditional attention mechanisms in these models, while powerful, require significant computational and memory resources due to the necessity of recalculating and storing attention weights across different layers. This paper introduces a novel Shared Attention (SA) mechanism, designed to enhance the efficiency of LLMs by directly sharing computed attention weights across multiple layers. Unlike previous methods that focus on sharing intermediate Key-Value (KV) caches, our approach utilizes the isotropic tendencies of attention distributions observed in advanced LLMs post-pretraining to reduce both the computational flops and the size of the KV cache required during inference. We empirically demonstrate that implementing SA across various LLMs results in minimal accuracy loss on standard benchmarks. Our findings suggest that SA not only conserves computational resources but also maintains robust model performance, thereby facilitating the deployment of more efficient LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianan Fan, Dongnan Liu, Canran Li, Hang Chang, Heng Huang, Filip Braet, Mei Chen, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Cellular nuclei recognition serves as a fundamental and essential step in the workflow of digital pathology. However, with disparate source organs and staining procedures among histology image clusters, the scanned tiles inherently conform to a non-uniform data distribution, which induces deteriorated promises for general cross-cohort usages. Despite the latest efforts leveraging domain adaptation to mitigate distributional discrepancy, those methods are subjected to modeling the morphological characteristics of each cell individually, disregarding the hierarchical latent structure and intrinsic contextual correspondences across the tumor micro-environment. In this work, we identify the importance of implicit correspondences across biological contexts for exploiting domain-invariant pathological composition and thereby propose to exploit the dependence over various biological structures for domain adaptive cellular recognition. We discover those high-level correspondences via unsupervised contextual modeling and use them as bridges to facilitate adaptation over diverse organs and stains. In addition, to further exploit the rich spatial contexts embedded amongst nuclear communities, we propose self-adaptive dynamic distillation to secure instance-aware trade-offs across different model constituents. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on a broad spectrum of cross-domain settings under miscellaneous data distribution shifts and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.</p>

<p>Abstract: Utilizing complex tools with Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical component for grounding AI agents in various real-world scenarios. The core challenge of manipulating tools lies in understanding their usage and functionality. The prevailing approach involves few-shot prompting with demonstrations or fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, for complex tools and tasks, mere in-context demonstrations may fail to cover sufficient knowledge. Training-based methods are also constrained by the high cost of dataset construction and limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce a new tool learning methodology (MetaTool) that is generalizable for mastering any reusable toolset. Our approach includes a self-supervised data augmentation technique that enables LLMs to gain a comprehensive understanding of various tools, thereby improving their ability to complete tasks effectively. We develop a series of meta-tasks that involve predicting masked factors of tool execution. These self-supervised tasks enable the automatic generation of high-quality QA data concerning tool comprehension. By incorporating meta-task data into the instruction tuning process, the proposed MetaTool model achieves significant superiority to open-source models and is comparable to GPT-4/GPT-3.5 on multiple tool-oriented tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) perform Question Answering (QA) tasks in various domains. However, RAG based on open-source LLM for specialized domains has challenges of evaluating generated responses. A popular framework in the literature is the RAG Assessment (RAGAS), a publicly available library which uses LLMs for evaluation. One disadvantage of RAGAS is the lack of details of derivation of numerical value of the evaluation metrics. One of the outcomes of this work is a modified version of this package for few metrics (faithfulness, context relevance, answer relevance, answer correctness, answer similarity and factual correctness) through which we provide the intermediate outputs of the prompts by using any LLMs. Next, we analyse the expert evaluations of the output of the modified RAGAS package and observe the challenges of using it in the telecom domain. We also study the effect of the metrics under correct vs. wrong retrieval and observe that few of the metrics have higher values for correct retrieval. We also study for differences in metrics between base embeddings and those domain adapted via pre-training and fine-tuning. Finally, we comment on the suitability and challenges of using these metrics for in-the-wild telecom QA task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Jiang, Yimin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) exhibit exceptional performance in visual-language reasoning across diverse cross-modal benchmarks. Despite these advances, recent research indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, underachieve compared to well-trained smaller models, such as BERT, in Fake News Detection (FND), prompting inquiries into LVLMs' efficacy in FND tasks. Although performance could improve through fine-tuning LVLMs, the substantial parameters and requisite pre-trained weights render it a resource-heavy endeavor for FND applications. This paper initially assesses the FND capabilities of two notable LVLMs, CogVLM and GPT4V, in comparison to a smaller yet adeptly trained CLIP model in a zero-shot context. The findings demonstrate that LVLMs can attain performance competitive with that of the smaller model. Next, we integrate standard in-context learning (ICL) with LVLMs, noting improvements in FND performance, though limited in scope and consistency. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{F}ake \textbf{N}ews \textbf{D}etection (IMFND) framework, enriching in-context examples and test inputs with predictions and corresponding probabilities from a well-trained smaller model. This strategic integration directs the LVLMs' focus towards news segments associated with higher probabilities, thereby improving their analytical accuracy. The experimental results suggest that the IMFND framework significantly boosts the FND efficiency of LVLMs, achieving enhanced accuracy over the standard ICL approach across three publicly available FND datasets.</p>

The distinctiveness of InstructAV lies in its ability to align classification decisions with transparent and understandable explanations, representing a significant progression in the field of authorship verification. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across various datasets, InstructAV demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance on the AV task, offering high classification accuracy coupled with enhanced explanation reliability.</p>

We conduct experiments to observe how incremental changes in input affect the explanations provided by different XAI methods. Through this approach, we aim to evaluate the models' capability to generalize and abstract semantic concepts accurately and to evaluate different XAI methods in correctly capturing the model behaviour. This paper contributes to the broader discourse on AI interpretability by proposing a quantitative measure for semantic continuity for XAI methods, offering insights into the models' and explainers' internal reasoning processes, and promoting more reliable and transparent AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Papagiannis, Norman Di Palo, Pietro Vitiello, Edward Johns</p>
<p>Abstract: We present R+X, a framework which enables robots to learn skills from long, unlabelled, first-person videos of humans performing everyday tasks. Given a language command from a human, R+X first retrieves short video clips containing relevant behaviour, and then executes the skill by conditioning an in-context imitation learning method on this behaviour. By leveraging a Vision Language Model (VLM) for retrieval, R+X does not require any manual annotation of the videos, and by leveraging in-context learning for execution, robots can perform commanded skills immediately, without requiring a period of training on the retrieved videos. Experiments studying a range of everyday household tasks show that R+X succeeds at translating unlabelled human videos into robust robot skills, and that R+X outperforms several recent alternative methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunbum Kook, Matthew S. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Uniform sampling over a convex body is a fundamental algorithmic problem, yet the convergence in KL or R\'enyi divergence of most samplers remains poorly understood. In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases.
  By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiquan Lu, Xiaotian Liu, Yefan Zhou, Qunli Li, Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Yujun Yan, Huanrui Yang, Yaoqing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies on deep ensembles have identified the sharpness of the local minima of individual learners and the diversity of the ensemble members as key factors in improving test-time performance. Building on this, our study investigates the interplay between sharpness and diversity within deep ensembles, illustrating their crucial role in robust generalization to both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We discover a trade-off between sharpness and diversity: minimizing the sharpness in the loss landscape tends to diminish the diversity of individual members within the ensemble, adversely affecting the ensemble's improvement. The trade-off is justified through our theoretical analysis and verified empirically through extensive experiments. To address the issue of reduced diversity, we introduce SharpBalance, a novel training approach that balances sharpness and diversity within ensembles. Theoretically, we show that our training strategy achieves a better sharpness-diversity trade-off. Empirically, we conducted comprehensive evaluations in various data sets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet) and showed that SharpBalance not only effectively improves the sharpness-diversity trade-off, but also significantly improves ensemble performance in ID and OOD scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Kozodoi, Stefan Lessmann, Morteza Alamgir, Luis Moreira-Matias, Konstantinos Papakonstantinou</p>
<p>Abstract: Scoring models support decision-making in financial institutions. Their estimation and evaluation are based on the data of previously accepted applicants with known repayment behavior. This creates sampling bias: the available labeled data offers a partial picture of the distribution of candidate borrowers, which the model is supposed to score. The paper addresses the adverse effect of sampling bias on model training and evaluation. To improve scorecard training, we propose bias-aware self-learning - a reject inference framework that augments the biased training data by inferring labels for selected rejected applications. For scorecard evaluation, we propose a Bayesian framework that extends standard accuracy measures to the biased setting and provides a reliable estimate of future scorecard performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the superiority of our propositions over various benchmarks in predictive performance and profitability. By sensitivity analysis, we also identify boundary conditions affecting their performance. Notably, we leverage real-world data from a randomized controlled trial to assess the novel methodologies on holdout data that represent the true borrower population. Our findings confirm that reject inference is a difficult problem with modest potential to improve scorecard performance. Addressing sampling bias during scorecard evaluation is a much more promising route to improve scoring practices. For example, our results suggest a profit improvement of about eight percent, when using Bayesian evaluation to decide on acceptance rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirreza Sokhankhosh, Sara Rouhani</p>
<p>Abstract: Regardless of their variations, blockchains require a consensus mechanism to validate transactions, supervise added blocks, maintain network security, synchronize the network state, and distribute incentives. Proof-of-Work (PoW), one of the most influential implementations of consensus mechanisms, consumes an extraordinary amount of energy for a task that lacks direct productive output. In this paper, we propose Proof-of-Collaborative-Learning (PoCL), a multi-winner federated learning validated consensus mechanism that redirects the computation power of blockchains to train federated learning models. In addition, we present a novel evaluation mechanism to ensure the efficiency of the locally trained models of miners. We evaluated the security of our evaluation mechanism by introducing and conducting probable attacks. Moreover, we present a novel reward distribution mechanism to incentivize winning miners fairly, and demonstrate that our reward system is fair both within and across all rounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vikramjit Mitra, Anirban Chatterjee, Ke Zhai, Helen Weng, Ayuko Hill, Nicole Hay, Christopher Webb, Jamie Cheng, Erdrin Azemi</p>
<p>Abstract: The process of human speech production involves coordinated respiratory action to elicit acoustic speech signals. Typically, speech is produced when air is forced from the lungs and is modulated by the vocal tract, where such actions are interspersed by moments of breathing in air (inhalation) to refill the lungs again. Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital metric that is used to assess the overall health, fitness, and general well-being of an individual. Existing approaches to measure RR (number of breaths one takes in a minute) are performed using specialized equipment or training. Studies have demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate RR using bio-sensor signals as input. Speech-based estimation of RR can offer an effective approach to measure the vital metric without requiring any specialized equipment or sensors. This work investigates a machine learning based approach to estimate RR from speech segments obtained from subjects speaking to a close-talking microphone device. Data were collected from N=26 individuals, where the groundtruth RR was obtained through commercial grade chest-belts and then manually corrected for any errors. A convolutional long-short term memory network (Conv-LSTM) is proposed to estimate respiration time-series data from the speech signal. We demonstrate that the use of pre-trained representations obtained from a foundation model, such as Wav2Vec2, can be used to estimate respiration-time-series with low root-mean-squared error and high correlation coefficient, when compared with the baseline. The model-driven time series can be used to estimate $RR$ with a low mean absolute error (MAE) ~ 1.6 breaths/min.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Hinojosa, Shuming Liu, Bernard Ghanem</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked AutoEncoders (MAE) have emerged as a robust self-supervised framework, offering remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. To increase the difficulty of the pretext task and learn richer visual representations, existing works have focused on replacing standard random masking with more sophisticated strategies, such as adversarial-guided and teacher-guided masking. However, these strategies depend on the input data thus commonly increasing the model complexity and requiring additional calculations to generate the mask patterns. This raises the question: Can we enhance MAE performance beyond random masking without relying on input data or incurring additional computational costs? In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective data-independent method, termed ColorMAE, which generates different binary mask patterns by filtering random noise. Drawing inspiration from color noise in image processing, we explore four types of filters to yield mask patterns with different spatial and semantic priors. ColorMAE requires no additional learnable parameters or computational overhead in the network, yet it significantly enhances the learned representations. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation, demonstrating our strategy's superiority in downstream tasks compared to random masking. Notably, we report an improvement of 2.72 in mIoU in semantic segmentation tasks relative to baseline MAE implementations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Faithful real-time facial animation is essential for avatar-mediated telepresence in Virtual Reality (VR). To emulate authentic communication, avatar animation needs to be efficient and accurate: able to capture both extreme and subtle expressions within a few milliseconds to sustain the rhythm of natural conversations. The oblique and incomplete views of the face, variability in the donning of headsets, and illumination variation due to the environment are some of the unique challenges in generalization to unseen faces. In this paper, we present a method that can animate a photorealistic avatar in realtime from head-mounted cameras (HMCs) on a consumer VR headset. We present a self-supervised learning approach, based on a cross-view reconstruction objective, that enables generalization to unseen users. We present a lightweight expression calibration mechanism that increases accuracy with minimal additional cost to run-time efficiency. We present an improved parameterization for precise ground-truth generation that provides robustness to environmental variation. The resulting system produces accurate facial animation for unseen users wearing VR headsets in realtime. We compare our approach to prior face-encoding methods demonstrating significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungeon Lee, Nina Corvelo Benz, Suhas Thejaswi, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: Resettlement agencies have started to adopt data-driven algorithmic matching to match refugees to locations using employment rate as a measure of utility. Given a pool of refugees, data-driven algorithmic matching utilizes a classifier to predict the probability that each refugee would find employment at any given location. Then, it uses the predicted probabilities to estimate the expected utility of all possible placement decisions. Finally, it finds the placement decisions that maximize the predicted utility by solving a maximum weight bipartite matching problem. In this work, we argue that, using existing solutions, there may be pools of refugees for which data-driven algorithmic matching is (counterfactually) harmful -- it would have achieved lower utility than a given default policy used in the past, had it been used. Then, we develop a post-processing algorithm that, given placement decisions made by a default policy on a pool of refugees and their employment outcomes, solves an inverse~matching problem to minimally modify the predictions made by a given classifier. Under these modified predictions, the optimal matching policy that maximizes predicted utility on the pool is guaranteed to be not harmful. Further, we introduce a Transformer model that, given placement decisions made by a default policy on multiple pools of refugees and their employment outcomes, learns to modify the predictions made by a classifier so that the optimal matching policy that maximizes predicted utility under the modified predictions on an unseen pool of refugees is less likely to be harmful than under the original predictions. Experiments on simulated resettlement processes using synthetic refugee data created from a variety of publicly available data suggest that our methodology may be effective in making algorithmic placement decisions that are less likely to be harmful than existing solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Digital textbook (e-book) systems record student interactions with textbooks as a sequence of events called EventStream data. In the past, researchers extracted meaningful features from EventStream, and utilized them as inputs for downstream tasks such as grade prediction and modeling of student behavior. Previous research evaluated models that mainly used statistical-based features derived from EventStream logs, such as the number of operation types or access frequencies. While these features are useful for providing certain insights, they lack temporal information that captures fine-grained differences in learning behaviors among different students. This study proposes E2Vec, a novel feature representation method based on word embeddings. The proposed method regards operation logs and their time intervals for each student as a string sequence of characters and generates a student vector of learning activity features that incorporates time information. We applied fastText to generate an embedding vector for each of 305 students in a dataset from two years of computer science courses. Then, we investigated the effectiveness of E2Vec in an at-risk detection task, demonstrating potential for generalizability and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study assessed the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting poverty levels in the Philippines using five boosting algorithms: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), CatBoosting (CatBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). CatBoost emerged as the superior model and achieved the highest scores across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score at 91 percent, while XGBoost and GBM followed closely with 89 percent and 88 percent respectively. Additionally, the research examined the computational efficiency of these models to analyze the balance between training time, testing speed, and model size factors crucial for real-world applications. Despite its longer training duration, CatBoost demonstrated high testing efficiency. These results indicate that machine learning can aid in poverty prediction and in the development of targeted policy interventions. Future studies should focus on incorporating a wider variety of data to enhance the predictive accuracy and policy utility of these models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prakhar Ganesh, Ihsan Ibrahim Daldaban, Ignacio Cofone, Golnoosh Farnadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Model multiplicity, the phenomenon where multiple models achieve similar performance despite different underlying learned functions, introduces arbitrariness in model selection. While this arbitrariness may seem inconsequential in expectation, its impact on individuals can be severe. This paper explores various individual concerns stemming from multiplicity, including the effects of arbitrariness beyond final predictions, disparate arbitrariness for individuals belonging to protected groups, and the challenges associated with the arbitrariness of a single algorithmic system creating a monopoly across various contexts. It provides both an empirical examination of these concerns and a comprehensive analysis from the legal standpoint, addressing how these issues are perceived in the anti-discrimination law in Canada. We conclude the discussion with technical challenges in the current landscape of model multiplicity to meet legal requirements and the legal gap between current law and the implications of arbitrariness in model selection, highlighting relevant future research directions for both disciplines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent introduction of OpenAI's text-to-video model Sora has sparked widespread public discourse across online communities. This study aims to uncover the dominant themes and narratives surrounding Sora by conducting topic modeling analysis on a corpus of 1,827 Reddit comments from five relevant subreddits (r/OpenAI, r/technology, r/singularity, r/vfx, and r/ChatGPT). The comments were collected over a two-month period following Sora's announcement in February 2024. After preprocessing the data, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to extract four key topics: 1) AI Impact and Trends in Sora Discussions, 2) Public Opinion and Concerns about Sora, 3) Artistic Expression and Video Creation with Sora, and 4) Sora's Applications in Media and Entertainment. Visualizations including word clouds, bar charts, and t-SNE clustering provided insights into the importance of topic keywords and the distribution of comments across topics. The results highlight prominent narratives around Sora's potential impact on industries and employment, public sentiment and ethical concerns, creative applications, and use cases in the media and entertainment sectors. While limited to Reddit data within a specific timeframe, this study offers a framework for understanding public perceptions of emerging generative AI technologies through online discourse analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shentong Mo, Pedro Morgado</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual generalized zero-shot learning is a rapidly advancing domain that seeks to understand the intricate relations between audio and visual cues within videos. The overarching goal is to leverage insights from seen classes to identify instances from previously unseen ones. Prior approaches primarily utilized synchronized auto-encoders to reconstruct audio-visual attributes, which were informed by cross-attention transformers and projected text embeddings. However, these methods fell short of effectively capturing the intricate relationship between cross-modal features and class-label embeddings inherent in pre-trained language-aligned embeddings. To circumvent these bottlenecks, we introduce a simple yet effective framework for Easy Audio-Visual Generalized Zero-shot Learning, named EZ-AVGZL, that aligns audio-visual embeddings with transformed text representations. It utilizes a single supervised text audio-visual contrastive loss to learn an alignment between audio-visual and textual modalities, moving away from the conventional approach of reconstructing cross-modal features and text embeddings. Our key insight is that while class name embeddings are well aligned with language-based audio-visual features, they don't provide sufficient class separation to be useful for zero-shot learning. To address this, our method leverages differential optimization to transform class embeddings into a more discriminative space while preserving the semantic structure of language representations. We conduct extensive experiments on VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL, and ActivityNet-GZSL benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that our EZ-AVGZL achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual generalized zero-shot learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini has posed new challenges for the academic community. With the help of these models, students can easily complete their assignments and exams, while educators struggle to detect AI-generated content. This has led to a surge in academic misconduct, as students present work generated by LLMs as their own, without putting in the effort required for learning. As AI tools become more advanced and produce increasingly human-like text, detecting such content becomes more challenging. This development has significantly impacted the academic world, where many educators are finding it difficult to adapt their assessment methods to this challenge.
  This research first demonstrates how LLMs have increased academic dishonesty, and then reviews state-of-the-art solutions for academic plagiarism in detail. A survey of datasets, algorithms, tools, and evasion strategies for plagiarism detection has been conducted, focusing on how LLMs and AI-generated content (AIGC) detection have affected this area. The survey aims to identify the gaps in existing solutions. Lastly, potential long-term solutions are presented to address the issue of academic plagiarism using LLMs based on AI tools and educational approaches in an ever-changing world.</p>

Traditional analysis of this data focuses on individual athletes with measures of internal and external loading such as distance covered in speed zones or rate of perceived exertion. However these metrics do not provide enough information to understand team dynamics within field sports. The spatio-temporal nature of match play necessitates an investment in date-engineering to adequately transform the data into a suitable format to extract features such as areas of activity. In this paper we present an approach to construct Time-Window Spatial Activity Graphs (TWGs) for field sports. Using GPS data obtained from Gaelic Football matches we demonstrate how our approach can be utilised to extract spatio-temporal features from GPS sensor data</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting student performance under varying data distributions is a challenging task. This study proposes a method to improve prediction accuracy by employing transfer learning techniques on the dataset with varying distributions. Using datasets from mathematics and Portuguese language courses, the model was trained and evaluated to enhance its generalization ability and prediction accuracy. The datasets used in this study were sourced from Kaggle, comprising a variety of attributes such as demographic details, social factors, and academic performance. The methodology involves using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with transfer learning, where some layer weights were progressively frozen, and the remaining layers were fine-tuned. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach excels in reducing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), while improving the coefficient of determination (R2). The model was initially trained on a subset with a larger sample size and subsequently fine-tuned on another subset. This method effectively facilitated knowledge transfer, enhancing model performance on tasks with limited data. The results demonstrate that freezing more layers improves performance for complex and noisy data, whereas freezing fewer layers is more effective for simpler and larger datasets. This study highlights the potential of transfer learning in predicting student performance and suggests future research to explore domain adaptation techniques for unlabeled datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Punctuation and word casing prediction are necessary for automatic speech recognition (ASR). With the popularity of on-device end-to-end streaming ASR systems, the on-device punctuation and word casing prediction become a necessity while we found little discussion on this. With the emergence of Transformer, Transformer based models have been explored for this scenario. However, Transformer based models are too large for on-device ASR systems. In this paper, we propose a light-weight and efficient model that jointly predicts punctuation and word casing in real time. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). Experimental results on the IWSLT2011 test set show that the proposed model obtains 9% relative improvement compared to the best of non-Transformer models on overall F1-score. Compared to the representative of Transformer based models, the proposed model achieves comparable results to the representative model while being only one-fortieth its size and 2.5 times faster in terms of inference time. It is suitable for on-device streaming ASR systems. Our code is publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Platnick, Bishoy Abdelnour, Eamon Earl, Rahul Kumar, Zahra Rezaei, Thomas Tsangaris, Faraj Lagum</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been increased demand for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) systems in industry settings. Although successfully commercialized, cloning-based S2ST systems expose their distributors to liabilities when misused by individuals and can infringe on personality rights when exploited by media organizations. This work proposes a regulated S2ST framework called Preset-Voice Matching (PVM). PVM removes cross-lingual voice cloning in S2ST by first matching the input voice to a similar prior consenting speaker voice in the target-language. With this separation, PVM avoids cloning the input speaker, ensuring PVM systems comply with regulations and reduce risk of misuse. Our results demonstrate PVM can significantly improve S2ST system run-time in multi-speaker settings and the naturalness of S2ST synthesized speech. To our knowledge, PVM is the first explicitly regulated S2ST framework leveraging similarly-matched preset-voices for dynamic S2ST tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George V. Moustakides</p>
<p>Abstract: When the underlying conditional density is known, conditional expectations can be computed analytically or numerically. When, however, such knowledge is not available and instead we are given a collection of training data, the goal of this work is to propose simple and purely data-driven means for estimating directly the desired conditional expectation. Because conditional expectations appear in the description of a number of stochastic optimization problems with the corresponding optimal solution satisfying a system of nonlinear equations, we extend our data-driven method to cover such cases as well. We test our methodology by applying it to Optimal Stopping and Optimal Action Policy in Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We aim to evaluate the efficacy of traditional machine learning and large language models (LLMs) in classifying anxiety and depression from long conversational transcripts. We fine-tune both established transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, Longformer) and more recent large models (Mistral-7B), trained a Support Vector Machine with feature engineering, and assessed GPT models through prompting. We observe that state-of-the-art models fail to enhance classification outcomes compared to traditional machine learning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Han, Huaixuan Shi, Xinyi Ding, Xiao Ma, Huamao Gu, Yili Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing truth inference methods in crowdsourcing aim to map redundant labels and items to the ground truth. They treat the ground truth as hidden variables and use statistical or deep learning-based worker behavior models to infer the ground truth. However, worker behavior models that rely on ground truth hidden variables overlook workers' behavior at the item feature level, leading to imprecise characterizations and negatively impacting the quality of truth inference. This paper proposes a new paradigm of multi-task supervised learning from crowds, which eliminates the need for modeling of items's ground truth in worker behavior models. Within this paradigm, we propose a worker behavior model at the item feature level called Mixture of Experts based Multi-task Supervised Learning from Crowds (MMLC). Two truth inference strategies are proposed within MMLC. The first strategy, named MMLC-owf, utilizes clustering methods in the worker spectral space to identify the projection vector of the oracle worker. Subsequently, the labels generated based on this vector are considered as the inferred truth. The second strategy, called MMLC-df, employs the MMLC model to fill the crowdsourced data, which can enhance the effectiveness of existing truth inference methods. Experimental results demonstrate that MMLC-owf outperforms state-of-the-art methods and MMLC-df enhances the quality of existing truth inference methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junying Chen, Chi Gui, Anningzhe Gao, Ke Ji, Xidong Wang, Xiang Wan, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of medical diagnosis has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of large language models (LLMs), yet the challenges of interpretability within these models remain largely unaddressed. This study introduces Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD) to enhance the interpretability of LLM-based medical diagnostics. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a diagnostic chain that mirrors a physician's thought process, providing a transparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence distribution to ensure transparency in decision-making. This interpretability makes model diagnostics controllable and aids in identifying critical symptoms for inquiry through the entropy reduction of confidences. With CoD, we developed DiagnosisGPT, capable of diagnosing 9604 diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that DiagnosisGPT outperforms other LLMs on diagnostic benchmarks. Moreover, DiagnosisGPT provides interpretability while ensuring controllability in diagnostic rigor.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bjarne Grimstad, Kristian L{\o}vland, Lars S. Imsland, Vidar Gunnerud</p>
<p>Abstract: In many industrial processes, an apparent lack of data limits the development of data-driven soft sensors. There are, however, often opportunities to learn stronger models by being more data-efficient. To achieve this, one can leverage knowledge about the data from which the soft sensor is learned. Taking advantage of properties frequently possessed by industrial data, we introduce a deep latent variable model for semi-supervised multi-unit soft sensing. This hierarchical, generative model is able to jointly model different units, as well as learning from both labeled and unlabeled data.
  An empirical study of multi-unit soft sensing is conducted using two datasets: a synthetic dataset of single-phase fluid flow, and a large, real dataset of multi-phase flow in oil and gas wells. We show that by combining semi-supervised and multi-task learning, the proposed model achieves superior results, outperforming current leading methods for this soft sensing problem. We also show that when a model has been trained on a multi-unit dataset, it may be finetuned to previously unseen units using only a handful of data points. In this finetuning procedure, unlabeled data improve soft sensor performance; remarkably, this is true even when no labeled data are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mahmoudi Filabadi, Tom Lefebvre, Guillaume Crevecoeur</p>
<p>Abstract: This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enzo Terreau, Antoine Gourru, Julien Velcin</p>
<p>Abstract: A wide range of Deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) models integrates continuous and low dimensional representations of words and documents. Surprisingly, very few models study representation learning for authors. These representations can be used for many NLP tasks, such as author identification and classification, or in recommendation systems. A strong limitation of existing works is that they do not explicitly capture writing style, making them hardly applicable to literary data. We therefore propose a new architecture based on Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) that learns embeddings for both authors and documents with a stylistic constraint. Our model fine-tunes a pre-trained document encoder. We stimulate the detection of writing style by adding predefined stylistic features making the representation axis interpretable with respect to writing style indicators. We evaluate our method on three datasets: a literary corpus extracted from the Gutenberg Project, the Blog Authorship Corpus and IMDb62, for which we show that it matches or outperforms strong/recent baselines in authorship attribution while capturing much more accurately the authors stylistic aspects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Audrey Huang, Wenhao Zhan, Tengyang Xie, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Dylan J. Foster</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model alignment methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), have led to impressive advances in language model capabilities, but existing techniques are limited by a widely observed phenomenon known as overoptimization, where the quality of the language model plateaus or degrades over the course of the alignment process. Overoptimization is often attributed to overfitting to an inaccurate reward model, and while it can be mitigated through online data collection, this is infeasible in many settings. This raises a fundamental question: Do existing offline alignment algorithms make the most of the data they have, or can their sample-efficiency be improved further?
  We address this question with a new algorithm for offline alignment, $\chi^2$-Preference Optimization ($\chi$PO). $\chi$PO is a one-line change to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023), which only involves modifying the logarithmic link function in the DPO objective. Despite this minimal change, $\chi$PO implicitly implements the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty via regularization with the $\chi^2$-divergence -- which quantifies uncertainty more effectively than KL-regularization -- and provably alleviates overoptimization, achieving sample-complexity guarantees based on single-policy concentrability -- the gold standard in offline reinforcement learning. $\chi$PO's simplicity and strong guarantees make it the first practical and general-purpose offline alignment algorithm that is provably robust to overoptimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Kortus (for the Bergen pCT Collaboration), Ralf Keidel (for the Bergen pCT Collaboration), Nicolas R. Gauger (for the Bergen pCT Collaboration)</p>
<p>Abstract: Measurement and analysis of high energetic particles for scientific, medical or industrial applications is a complex procedure, requiring the design of sophisticated detector and data processing systems. The development of adaptive and differentiable software pipelines using a combination of conventional and machine learning algorithms is therefore getting ever more important to optimize and operate the system efficiently while maintaining end-to-end (E2E) differentiability. We propose for the application of charged particle tracking an E2E differentiable decision-focused learning scheme using graph neural networks with combinatorial components solving a linear assignment problem for each detector layer. We demonstrate empirically that including differentiable variations of discrete assignment operations allows for efficient network optimization, working better or on par with approaches that lack E2E differentiability. In additional studies, we dive deeper into the optimization process and provide further insights from a loss landscape perspective. We demonstrate that while both methods converge into similar performing, globally well-connected regions, they suffer under substantial predictive instability across initialization and optimization methods, which can have unpredictable consequences on the performance of downstream tasks such as image reconstruction. We also point out a dependency between the interpolation factor of the gradient estimator and the prediction stability of the model, suggesting the choice of sufficiently small values. Given the strong global connectivity of learned solutions and the excellent training performance, we argue that E2E differentiability provides, besides the general availability of gradient information, an important tool for robust particle tracking to mitigate prediction instabilities by favoring solutions that perform well on downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Ole von Hartz, Tim Welschehold, Abhinav Valada, Joschka Boedecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Task Parametrized Gaussian Mixture Models (TP-GMM) are a sample-efficient method for learning object-centric robot manipulation tasks. However, there are several open challenges to applying TP-GMMs in the wild. In this work, we tackle three crucial challenges synergistically. First, end-effector velocities are non-Euclidean and thus hard to model using standard GMMs. We thus propose to factorize the robot's end-effector velocity into its direction and magnitude, and model them using Riemannian GMMs. Second, we leverage the factorized velocities to segment and sequence skills from complex demonstration trajectories. Through the segmentation, we further align skill trajectories and hence leverage time as a powerful inductive bias. Third, we present a method to automatically detect relevant task parameters per skill from visual observations. Our approach enables learning complex manipulation tasks from just five demonstrations while using only RGB-D observations. Extensive experimental evaluations on RLBench demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with 20-fold improved sample efficiency. Our policies generalize across different environments, object instances, and object positions, while the learned skills are reusable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Publicly available TTS datasets for low-resource languages like Hindi and Tamil typically contain 10-20 hours of data, leading to poor vocabulary coverage. This limitation becomes evident in downstream applications where domain-specific vocabulary coupled with frequent code-mixing with English, results in many OOV words. To highlight this problem, we create a benchmark containing OOV words from several real-world applications. Indeed, state-of-the-art Hindi and Tamil TTS systems perform poorly on this OOV benchmark, as indicated by intelligibility tests. To improve the model's OOV performance, we propose a low-effort and economically viable strategy to obtain more training data. Specifically, we propose using volunteers as opposed to high quality voice artists to record words containing character bigrams unseen in the training data. We show that using such inexpensive data, the model's performance improves on OOV words, while not affecting voice quality and in-domain performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition methods utilize projection networks to learn a shared latent space of skeleton features and semantic embeddings. The inherent imbalance in action recognition datasets, characterized by variable skeleton sequences yet constant class labels, presents significant challenges for alignment. To address the imbalance, we propose SA-DVAE -- Semantic Alignment via Disentangled Variational Autoencoders, a method that first adopts feature disentanglement to separate skeleton features into two independent parts -- one is semantic-related and another is irrelevant -- to better align skeleton and semantic features. We implement this idea via a pair of modality-specific variational autoencoders coupled with a total correction penalty. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD, and our experimental results show that SA-DAVE produces improved performance over existing methods.

<p>Abstract: Most recent successes in robot reinforcement learning involve learning a specialized single-task agent.
  However, robots capable of performing multiple tasks can be much more valuable in real-world applications.
  Multi-task reinforcement learning can be very challenging due to the increased sample complexity and the potentially conflicting task objectives.
  Previous work on this topic is dominated by model-free approaches.
  The latter can be very sample inefficient even when learning specialized single-task agents.
  In this work, we focus on model-based multi-task reinforcement learning.
  We propose a method for learning multi-task visual world models, leveraging pre-trained language models to extract semantically meaningful task representations.
  These representations are used by the world model and policy to reason about task similarity in dynamics and behavior.
  Our results highlight the benefits of using language-driven task representations for world models and a clear advantage of model-based multi-task learning over the more common model-free paradigm.</p>

For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate that adopting an information-centric approach to the problem presents a promising pathway for tackling these emerging complex legal issues.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spontaneous style speech synthesis, which aims to generate human-like speech, often encounters challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality data and limitations in model capabilities. Recent language model-based TTS systems can be trained on large, diverse, and low-quality speech datasets, resulting in highly natural synthesized speech. However, they are limited by the difficulty of simulating various spontaneous behaviors and capturing prosody variations in spontaneous speech. In this paper, we propose a novel spontaneous speech synthesis system based on language models. We systematically categorize and uniformly model diverse spontaneous behaviors. Moreover, fine-grained prosody modeling is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture subtle prosody variations in spontaneous speech.Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of prosody naturalness and spontaneous behavior naturalness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik Hoppe, Claudio Mayrink Verdun, Felix Krahmer, Marion I. Menzel, Holger Rauhut</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the last few years, debiased estimators have been proposed in order to establish rigorous confidence intervals for high-dimensional problems in machine learning and data science. The core argument is that the error of these estimators with respect to the ground truth can be expressed as a Gaussian variable plus a remainder term that vanishes as long as the dimension of the problem is sufficiently high. Thus, uncertainty quantification (UQ) can be performed exploiting the Gaussian model. Empirically, however, the remainder term cannot be neglected in many realistic situations of moderately-sized dimensions, in particular in certain structured measurement scenarios such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This, in turn, can downgrade the advantage of the UQ methods as compared to non-UQ approaches such as the standard LASSO. In this paper, we present a method to improve the debiased estimator by sampling without replacement. Our approach leverages recent results of ours on the structure of the random nature of certain sampling schemes showing how a transition between sampling with and without replacement can lead to a weighted reconstruction scheme with improved performance for the standard LASSO. In this paper, we illustrate how this reweighted sampling idea can also improve the debiased estimator and, consequently, provide a better method for UQ in Fourier imaging.</p>

In this work, we propose MeshFeat, a parametric feature encoding tailored to meshes, for which we adapt the idea of multi-resolution feature grids from Euclidean space. We start from the structure provided by the given vertex topology and use a mesh simplification algorithm to construct a multi-resolution feature representation directly on the mesh. The approach allows the usage of small MLPs for neural fields on meshes, and we show a significant speed-up compared to previous representations while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality for texture reconstruction and BRDF representation. Given its intrinsic coupling to the vertices, the method is particularly well-suited for representations on deforming meshes, making it a good fit for object animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aras Selvi, Eleonora Kreacic, Mohsen Ghassemi, Vamsi Potluru, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical risk minimization often fails to provide robustness against adversarial attacks in test data, causing poor out-of-sample performance. Adversarially robust optimization (ARO) has thus emerged as the de facto standard for obtaining models that hedge against such attacks. However, while these models are robust against adversarial attacks, they tend to suffer severely from overfitting. To address this issue for logistic regression, we study the Wasserstein distributionally robust (DR) counterpart of ARO and show that this problem admits a tractable reformulation. Furthermore, we develop a framework to reduce the conservatism of this problem by utilizing an auxiliary dataset (e.g., synthetic, external, or out-of-domain data), whenever available, with instances independently sampled from a nonidentical but related ground truth. In particular, we intersect the ambiguity set of the DR problem with another Wasserstein ambiguity set that is built using the auxiliary dataset. We analyze the properties of the underlying optimization problem, develop efficient solution algorithms, and demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark approaches on real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deploying deep learning-based imaging tools across various clinical sites poses significant challenges due to inherent domain shifts and regulatory hurdles associated with site-specific fine-tuning. For histopathology, stain normalization techniques can mitigate discrepancies, but they often fall short of eliminating inter-site variations. Therefore, we present Data Alchemy, an explainable stain normalization method combined with test time data calibration via a template learning framework to overcome barriers in cross-site analysis. Data Alchemy handles shifts inherent to multi-site data and minimizes them without needing to change the weights of the normalization or classifier networks. Our approach extends to unseen sites in various clinical settings where data domain discrepancies are unknown. Extensive experiments highlight the efficacy of our framework in tumor classification in hematoxylin and eosin-stained patches. Our explainable normalization method boosts classification tasks' area under the precision-recall curve(AUPR) by 0.165, 0.545 to 0.710. Additionally, Data Alchemy further reduces the multisite classification domain gap, by improving the 0.710 AUPR an additional 0.142, elevating classification performance further to 0.852, from 0.545. Our Data Alchemy framework can popularize precision medicine with minimal operational overhead by allowing for the seamless integration of pre-trained deep learning-based clinical tools across multiple sites.</p>

In this paper, we present PASTA, an autoregressive transformer architecture for generating high quality 3D shapes. PASTA comprises two main components: An autoregressive transformer that generates objects as a sequence of cuboidal primitives and a blending network, implemented with a transformer decoder that composes the sequences of cuboids and synthesizes high quality meshes for each object. Our model is trained in two stages: First we train our autoregressive generative model using only annotated cuboidal parts as supervision and next, we train our blending network using explicit 3D supervision, in the form of watertight meshes. Evaluations on various ShapeNet objects showcase the ability of our model to perform shape generation from diverse inputs \eg from scratch, from a partial object, from text and images, as well size-guided generation, by explicitly conditioning on a bounding box that defines the object's boundaries. Moreover, as our model considers the underlying part-based structure of a 3D object, we are able to select a specific part and produce shapes with meaningful variations of this part. As evidenced by our experiments, our model generates 3D shapes that are both more realistic and diverse than existing part-based and non part-based methods, while at the same time is simpler to implement and train.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fernando Berzal, Alberto Garcia</p>
<p>Abstract: Trend following and momentum investing are common strategies employed by asset managers. Even though they can be helpful in the proper situations, they are limited in the sense that they work just by looking at past, as if we were driving with our focus on the rearview mirror. In this paper, we advocate for the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict future market trends. These predictions, when done properly, can improve the performance of asset managers by increasing returns and reducing drawdowns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xu, Yung Cheng Hsu, William Biscarri</p>
<p>Abstract: Securities lending is an important part of the financial market structure, where agent lenders help long term institutional investors to lend out their securities to short sellers in exchange for a lending fee. Agent lenders within the market seek to optimize revenue by lending out securities at the highest rate possible. Typically, this rate is set by hard-coded business rules or standard supervised machine learning models. These approaches are often difficult to scale and are not adaptive to changing market conditions. Unlike a traditional stock exchange with a centralized limit order book, the securities lending market is organized similarly to an e-commerce marketplace, where agent lenders and borrowers can transact at any agreed price in a bilateral fashion. This similarity suggests that the use of typical methods for addressing dynamic pricing problems in e-commerce could be effective in the securities lending market. We show that existing contextual bandit frameworks can be successfully utilized in the securities lending market. Using offline evaluation on real historical data, we show that the contextual bandit approach can consistently outperform typical approaches by at least 15% in terms of total revenue generated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijie Pan, Stepan Gordeev, Jiahui Zhao, Ziyi Meng, Caiwen Ding, Sandro Steinbach, Dongjin Song</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for predicting international bilateral trade flows, emphasizing the growing importance of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) in the global trade landscape. Acknowledging the limitations of traditional models like the Gravity Model of Trade, this study introduces a two-stage approach combining explainable machine learning and factorization models. The first stage employs SHAP Explainer for effective variable selection, identifying key provisions in PTAs, while the second stage utilizes Factorization Machine models to analyze the pairwise interaction effects of these provisions on trade flows. By analyzing comprehensive datasets, the paper demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. The findings not only enhance the predictive accuracy of trade flow models but also offer deeper insights into the complex dynamics of international trade, influenced by specific bilateral trade provisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linping Qu, Yuyi Mao, Shenghui Song, Chi-Ying Tsui</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most critical challenges for deploying distributed learning, such as federated learning (FL), in wireless networks is the limited battery capacity of mobile devices. While it is a common belief that the major energy consumption of mobile devices comes from the uplink data transmission, this paper presents a novel finding, namely the channel decoding operation also contributes significantly to the overall energy consumption of mobile devices in FL. Motivated by this new observation, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive channel decoding scheme that leverages the intrinsic robustness of FL to model errors. In particular, the robustness is exploited to reduce the energy consumption of channel decoders at mobile devices by adaptively adjusting the number of decoding iterations. We theoretically prove that FL with communication errors can converge at the same rate as error-free communication as long as the bit error rate (BER) is properly constrained. An adaptive channel decoding scheme is then proposed to improve the energy efficiency of FL systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the same learning accuracy while reducing the channel decoding energy consumption by 20% when compared to existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calvin Alvares, Souvik Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past few years, equation discovery has gained popularity in different fields of science and engineering. However, existing equation discovery algorithms rely on the availability of noisy measurements of the state variables (i.e., displacement {and velocity}). This is a major bottleneck in structural dynamics, where we often only have access to acceleration measurements. To that end, this paper introduces a novel equation discovery algorithm for discovering governing equations of dynamical systems from acceleration-only measurements. The proposed algorithm employs a library-based approach for equation discovery. To enable equation discovery from acceleration-only measurements, we propose a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) model that prioritizes parsimonious models. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using {four} structural dynamics examples that include both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. The case studies presented illustrate the possible application of the proposed approach for equation discovery of dynamical systems from acceleration-only measurements.</p>

<p>Abstract: The detection of semantic and covariate out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is a critical yet overlooked challenge in digital pathology (DP). Recently, substantial insight and methods on OOD detection were presented by the ML community, but how do they fare in DP applications? To this end, we establish a benchmark study, our highlights being: 1) the adoption of proper evaluation protocols, 2) the comparison of diverse detectors in both a single and multi-model setting, and 3) the exploration into advanced ML settings like transfer learning (ImageNet vs. DP pre-training) and choice of architecture (CNNs vs. transformers). Through our comprehensive experiments, we contribute new insights and guidelines, paving the way for future research and discussion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Liu, Pengfei Liu, Arman Cohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a widely used training method for the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we explore an under-investigated aspect of DPO - its dependency on the reference model or policy. Such reference policies, typically instantiated as the model to be further fine-tuned, are important since they can impose an upper limit on DPO's effectiveness. Therefore, we address three related research questions in this work. First, we explore the optimal strength of the KL-divergence constraint in DPO, which penalizes deviations from the reference policy, and find that DPO is sensitive to this strength. Next, we examine the necessity of reference policies for instruction fine-tuning by providing both theoretical and empirical comparisons between DPO and related learning objectives, demonstrating DPO's superiority. Additionally, we investigate whether DPO benefits from stronger reference policies, finding that a stronger reference policy can lead to improved performance, but only when it is similar to the model being fine-tuned. Our findings highlight the confounding role of reference policies in DPO and offer insights for best practices, while also identifying open research questions for future studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present OxonFair, a new open source toolkit for enforcing fairness in binary classification. Compared to existing toolkits: (i) We support NLP and Computer Vision classification as well as standard tabular problems. (ii) We support enforcing fairness on validation data, making us robust to a wide range of overfitting challenges. (iii) Our approach can optimize any measure based on True Positives, False Positive, False Negatives, and True Negatives. This makes it easily extendable and much more expressive than existing toolkits. It supports 9/9 and 10/10 of the decision-based group metrics of two popular review papers. (iv) We jointly optimize a performance objective. This not only minimizes degradation while enforcing fairness, but can improve the performance of otherwise inadequately tuned unfair baselines. OxonFair is compatible with standard ML toolkits including sklearn, Autogluon, and PyTorch and is available online at https://github.com/oxfordinternetinstitute/oxonfair</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ans Munir, Faisal Z. Qureshi, Muhammad Haris Khan, Mohsen Ali</p>
<p>Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to predict unknown compositions made up of attribute and object pairs. Predicting compositions unseen during training is a challenging task. We are exploring Open World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) in this study, where our test space encompasses all potential combinations of attributes and objects. Our approach involves utilizing the self-attention mechanism between attributes and objects to achieve better generalization from seen to unseen compositions. Utilizing a self-attention mechanism facilitates the model's ability to identify relationships between attribute and objects. The similarity between the self-attended textual and visual features is subsequently calculated to generate predictions during the inference phase. The potential test space may encompass implausible object-attribute combinations arising from unrestricted attribute-object pairings. To mitigate this issue, we leverage external knowledge from ConceptNet to restrict the test space to realistic compositions. Our proposed model, Attention-based Simple Primitives (ASP), demonstrates competitive performance, achieving results comparable to the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Ghorbani, Emilien Bauer, Tobias Grosser, Amir Shaikhha</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor algebra is a crucial component for data-intensive workloads such as machine learning and scientific computing. As the complexity of data grows, scientists often encounter a dilemma between the highly specialized dense tensor algebra and efficient structure-aware algorithms provided by sparse tensor algebra. In this paper, we introduce DASTAC, a framework to propagate the tensors's captured high-level structure down to low-level code generation by incorporating techniques such as automatic data layout compression, polyhedral analysis, and affine code generation. Our methodology reduces memory footprint by automatically detecting the best data layout, heavily benefits from polyhedral optimizations, leverages further optimizations, and enables parallelization through MLIR. Through extensive experimentation, we show that DASTAC achieves 1 to 2 orders of magnitude speedup over TACO, a state-of-the-art sparse tensor compiler, and StructTensor, a state-of-the-art structured tensor algebra compiler, with a significantly lower memory footprint.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitris Bertsimas, Nicholas A. G. Johnson</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a partially observed matrix under the low rank assumption in the presence of fully observed side information that depends linearly on the true underlying matrix. This problem consists of an important generalization of the Matrix Completion problem, a central problem in Statistics, Operations Research and Machine Learning, that arises in applications such as recommendation systems, signal processing, system identification and image denoising. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem with an objective that balances the strength of the fit of the reconstruction to the observed entries with the ability of the reconstruction to be predictive of the side information. We derive a mixed-projection reformulation of the resulting optimization problem and present a strong semidefinite cone relaxation. We design an efficient, scalable alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that produces high quality feasible solutions to the problem of interest. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the small rank regime ($k \leq 15$), our algorithm outputs solutions that achieve on average $79\%$ lower objective value and $90.1\%$ lower $\ell_2$ reconstruction error than the solutions returned by the experiment-wise best performing benchmark method. The runtime of our algorithm is competitive with and often superior to that of the benchmark methods. Our algorithm is able to solve problems with $n = 10000$ rows and $m = 10000$ columns in less than a minute.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite machine learning models being widely used today, the relationship between a model and its training dataset is not well understood. We explore correlation inference attacks, whether and when a model leaks information about the correlations between the input variables of its training dataset. We first propose a model-less attack, where an adversary exploits the spherical parametrization of correlation matrices alone to make an informed guess. Second, we propose a model-based attack, where an adversary exploits black-box model access to infer the correlations using minimal and realistic assumptions. Third, we evaluate our attacks against logistic regression and multilayer perceptron models on three tabular datasets and show the models to leak correlations. We finally show how extracted correlations can be used as building blocks for attribute inference attacks and enable weaker adversaries. Our results raise fundamental questions on what a model does and should remember from its training set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vithursan Thangarasa, Shreyas Saxena, Abhay Gupta, Sean Lie</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has focused on weight sparsity in deep neural network training to reduce FLOPs, aiming for improved efficiency (test accuracy w.r.t training FLOPs). However, sparse weight training often compromises accuracy, requiring extended training schedules to attain the accuracy of dense models. In contrast, our approach, Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations (Sparse-IFT), uses sparsity to improve accuracy while maintaining dense model FLOPs. Using a single hyperparameter (i.e., the sparsity level), Sparse-IFTs efficiently replace dense layers, expanding the search space for optimal sparse masks. In addition, dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparse-IFT models effectively navigate this larger sparse mask-weight space, which is evidenced by a spectral analysis using Ramanujan graph properties. Our study reveals a robust correlation among mask topology, weights, and final performance. Notably, without adjusting any training hyperparameters, replacing dense layers with Sparse-IFT yields significant improvements, such as a +3.5% boost for ResNet-18 on ImageNet and +0.9% for GPT-3 Small on the Open LLM leaderboard. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the use of sparsity for improving the accuracy of dense models through a set of simple-to-use sparse transformations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jackie Baek, Justin J. Boutilier, Vivek F. Farias, Jonas Oddur Jonasson, Erez Yoeli</p>
<p>Abstract: Behavioral health interventions, delivered through digital platforms, have the potential to significantly improve health outcomes, through education, motivation, reminders, and outreach. We study the problem of optimizing personalized interventions for patients to maximize a long-term outcome, where interventions are costly and capacity-constrained. We assume we have access to a historical dataset collected from an initial pilot study. We present a new approach for this problem that we dub DecompPI, which decomposes the state space for a system of patients to the individual level and then approximates one step of policy iteration. Implementing DecompPI simply consists of a prediction task using the dataset, alleviating the need for online experimentation. DecompPI is a generic model-free algorithm that can be used irrespective of the underlying patient behavior model. We derive theoretical guarantees on a simple, special case of the model that is representative of our problem setting. When the initial policy used to collect the data is randomized, we establish an approximation guarantee for DecompPI with respect to the improvement beyond a null policy that does not allocate interventions. We show that this guarantee is robust to estimation errors. We then conduct a rigorous empirical case study using real-world data from a mobile health platform for improving treatment adherence for tuberculosis. Using a validated simulation model, we demonstrate that DecompPI can provide the same efficacy as the status quo approach with approximately half the capacity of interventions. DecompPI is simple and easy to implement for an organization aiming to improve long-term behavior through targeted interventions, and this paper demonstrates its strong performance both theoretically and empirically, particularly in resource-limited settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subarnaduti Paul, Lars-Joel Frey, Roshni Kamath, Kristian Kersting, Martin Mundt</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning is typically framed from a perspective of i.i.d., and more importantly, isolated data. In parts, federated learning lifts this assumption, as it sets out to solve the real-world challenge of collaboratively learning a shared model from data distributed across clients. However, motivated primarily by privacy and computational constraints, the fact that data may change, distributions drift, or even tasks advance individually on clients, is seldom taken into account. The field of continual learning addresses this separate challenge and first steps have recently been taken to leverage synergies in distributed supervised settings, in which several clients learn to solve changing classification tasks over time without forgetting previously seen ones. Motivated by these prior works, we posit that such federated continual learning should be grounded in unsupervised learning of representations that are shared across clients; in the loose spirit of how humans can indirectly leverage others' experience without exposure to a specific task. For this purpose, we demonstrate that masked autoencoders for distribution estimation are particularly amenable to this setup. Specifically, their masking strategy can be seamlessly integrated with task attention mechanisms to enable selective knowledge transfer between clients. We empirically corroborate the latter statement through several continual federated scenarios on both image and binary datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Egger, Christoph Hofmeister, Antonia Wachter-Zeh, Rawad Bitar</p>
<p>Abstract: In federated learning, a federator coordinates the training of a model, e.g., a neural network, on privately owned data held by several participating clients. The gradient descent algorithm, a well-known and popular iterative optimization procedure, is run to train the model. Every client computes partial gradients based on their local data and sends them to the federator, which aggregates the results and updates the model. Privacy of the clients' data is a major concern. In fact, it is shown that observing the partial gradients can be enough to reveal the clients' data. Existing literature focuses on private aggregation schemes that tackle the privacy problem in federated learning in settings where all users are connected to each other and to the federator. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical wireless system architecture in which the clients are connected to base stations; the base stations are connected to the federator either directly or through relays. We examine settings with and without relays, and derive fundamental limits on the communication cost under information-theoretic privacy with different collusion assumptions. We introduce suitable private aggregation schemes tailored for these settings whose communication costs are multiplicative factors away from the derived bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the life cycle of the machine learning (ML) model is an intriguing area of research (e.g., understanding where the model comes from, how it is trained, and how it is used). This paper focuses on a novel problem within this field, namely Model Provenance (MP), which concerns the relationship between a target model and its pre-training model and aims to determine whether a source model serves as the provenance for a target model. This is an important problem that has significant implications for ensuring the security and intellectual property of machine learning models but has not received much attention in the literature. To fill in this gap, we introduce a novel concept of Model DNA which represents the unique characteristics of a machine learning model. We utilize a data-driven and model-driven representation learning method to encode the model's training data and input-output information as a compact and comprehensive representation (i.e., DNA) of the model. Using this model DNA, we develop an efficient framework for model provenance identification, which enables us to identify whether a source model is a pre-training model of a target model. We conduct evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks using various models, datasets, and scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying model provenance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Ding, Jieming Shi, Qing Li, Jiannong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Cryptocurrencies are rapidly expanding and becoming vital in digital financial markets. However, the rise in cryptocurrency-related illicit activities has led to significant losses for users. To protect the security of these platforms, it is critical to identify illicit accounts effectively. Current detection methods mainly depend on feature engineering or are inadequate to leverage the complex information within cryptocurrency transaction networks, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present DIAM, an effective method for detecting illicit accounts in cryptocurrency transaction networks modeled by directed multi-graphs with attributed edges. DIAM first features an Edge2Seq module that captures intrinsic transaction patterns from parallel edges by considering edge attributes and their directed sequences, to generate effective node representations. Then in DIAM, we design a multigraph Discrepancy (MGD) module with a tailored message passing mechanism to capture the discrepant features between normal and illicit nodes over the multigraph topology, assisted by an attention mechanism. DIAM integrates these techniques for end-to-end training to detect illicit accounts from legitimate ones. Extensive experiments, comparing against 15 existing solutions on 4 large cryptocurrency datasets of Bitcoin and Ethereum, demonstrate that DIAM consistently outperforms others in accurately identifying illicit accounts. For example, on a Bitcoin dataset with 20 million nodes and 203 million edges, DIAM attains an F1 score of 96.55%, markedly surpassing the runner-up's score of 83.92%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shlomit Shachor, Natalia Razinkov, Abigail Goldsteen</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are prevalent in everyday life, with use cases in retail, manufacturing, health, and many other fields. With the rise in AI adoption, associated risks have been identified, including privacy risks to the people whose data was used to train models. Assessing the privacy risks of machine learning models is crucial to enabling knowledgeable decisions on whether to use, deploy, or share a model. A common approach to privacy risk assessment is to run one or more known attacks against the model and measure their success rate. We present a novel framework for running membership inference attacks against classification models. Our framework takes advantage of the ensemble method, generating many specialized attack models for different subsets of the data. We show that this approach achieves higher accuracy than either a single attack model or an attack model per class label, both on classical and language classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runxue Bao, Yiming Sun, Yuhe Gao, Jindong Wang, Qiang Yang, Zhi-Hong Mao, Ye Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of transfer learning, leveraging knowledge from source domains to enhance model performance in a target domain, has significantly grown, supporting diverse real-world applications. Its success often relies on shared knowledge between domains, typically required in these methodologies. Commonly, methods assume identical feature and label spaces in both domains, known as homogeneous transfer learning. However, this is often impractical as source and target domains usually differ in these spaces, making precise data matching challenging and costly. Consequently, heterogeneous transfer learning (HTL), which addresses these disparities, has become a vital strategy in various tasks. In this paper, we offer an extensive review of over 60 HTL methods, covering both data-based and model-based approaches. We describe the key assumptions and algorithms of these methods and systematically categorize them into instance-based, feature representation-based, parameter regularization, and parameter tuning techniques. Additionally, we explore applications in natural language processing, computer vision, multimodal learning, and biomedicine, aiming to deepen understanding and stimulate further research in these areas. Our paper includes recent advancements in HTL, such as the introduction of transformer-based models and multimodal learning techniques, ensuring the review captures the latest developments in the field. We identify key limitations in current HTL studies and offer systematic guidance for future research, highlighting areas needing further exploration and suggesting potential directions for advancing the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Ding, Jieming Shi, Shiqi Shen, Xuequn Shang, Jiannong Cao, Zhipeng Wang, Zhi Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-level representation learning is important in a wide range of applications. Existing graph-level models are generally built on i.i.d. assumption for both training and testing graphs. However, in an open world, models can encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) testing graphs that are from different distributions unknown during training. A trustworthy model should be able to detect OOD graphs to avoid unreliable predictions, while producing accurate in-distribution (ID) predictions. To achieve this, we present SGOOD, a novel graph-level OOD detection framework. We find that substructure differences commonly exist between ID and OOD graphs, and design SGOOD with a series of techniques to encode task-agnostic substructures for effective OOD detection. Specifically, we build a super graph of substructures for every graph, and develop a two-level graph encoding pipeline that works on both original graphs and super graphs to obtain substructure-enhanced graph representations. We then devise substructure-preserving graph augmentation techniques to further capture more substructure semantics of ID graphs. Extensive experiments against 11 competitors on numerous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of SGOOD, often surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.

<p>Abstract: Can we preserve the accuracy of neural models while also providing faithful explanations? We present wrapper boxes, a general approach to generate faithful, example-based explanations for model predictions while maintaining predictive performance. After training a neural model as usual, its learned feature representation is input to a classic, interpretable model to perform the actual prediction. This simple strategy is surprisingly effective, with results largely comparable to those of the original neural model, as shown across three large pre-trained language models, two datasets of varying scale, four classic models, and four evaluation metrics. Moreover, because these classic models are interpretable by design, the subset of training examples that determine classic model predictions can be shown directly to users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Sardana, Jacob Portes, Sasha Doubov, Jonathan Frankle</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling laws are empirical formulas that estimate changes in model quality as a result of increasing parameter count and training data. However, these formulas, including the popular Deepmind Chinchilla scaling laws, neglect to include the cost of inference. We modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to calculate the optimal LLM parameter count and pre-training data size to train and deploy a model of a given quality and inference demand. We conduct our analysis both in terms of a compute budget and real-world costs and find that LLM researchers expecting reasonably large inference demand (~1B requests) should train models smaller and longer than Chinchilla-optimal. Furthermore, we train 47 models of varying sizes and parameter counts to validate our formula and find that model quality continues to improve as we scale tokens per parameter to extreme ranges (up to 10,000). Finally, we ablate the procedure used to fit the Chinchilla scaling law coefficients and find that developing scaling laws only from data collected at typical token/parameter ratios overestimates the impact of additional tokens at these extreme ranges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Idan Attias, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite, Mahdi Haghifam, Roi Livni, Daniel M. Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interplay between memorization and learning in the context of \emph{stochastic convex optimization} (SCO). We define memorization via the information a learning algorithm reveals about its training data points. We then quantify this information using the framework of conditional mutual information (CMI) proposed by Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). Our main result is a precise characterization of the tradeoff between the accuracy of a learning algorithm and its CMI, answering an open question posed by Livni (2023). We show that, in the $L^2$ Lipschitz--bounded setting and under strong convexity, every learner with an excess error $\varepsilon$ has CMI bounded below by $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$, respectively. We further demonstrate the essential role of memorization in learning problems in SCO by designing an adversary capable of accurately identifying a significant fraction of the training samples in specific SCO problems. Finally, we enumerate several implications of our results, such as a limitation of generalization bounds based on CMI and the incompressibility of samples in SCO problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Sheng, Junwei Su, Chao Huang, Chuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory-based Temporal Graph Neural Networks (MTGNNs) are a class of temporal graph neural networks that utilize a node memory module to capture and retain long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, the iterative reading and updating process of the memory module in MTGNNs to obtain up-to-date information needs to follow the temporal dependencies. This introduces significant overhead and limits training throughput. Existing optimizations for static GNNs are not directly applicable to MTGNNs due to differences in training paradigm, model architecture, and the absence of a memory module. Moreover, they do not effectively address the challenges posed by temporal dependencies, making them ineffective for MTGNN training. In this paper, we propose MSPipe, a general and efficient framework for MTGNNs that maximizes training throughput while maintaining model accuracy. Our design addresses the unique challenges associated with fetching and updating node memory states in MTGNNs by integrating staleness into the memory module. However, simply introducing a predefined staleness bound in the memory module to break temporal dependencies may lead to suboptimal performance and lack of generalizability across different models and datasets. To solve this, we introduce an online pipeline scheduling algorithm in MSPipe that strategically breaks temporal dependencies with minimal staleness and delays memory fetching to obtain fresher memory states. Moreover, we design a staleness mitigation mechanism to enhance training convergence and model accuracy. We provide convergence analysis and prove that MSPipe maintains the same convergence rate as vanilla sample-based GNN training. Experimental results show that MSPipe achieves up to 2.45x speed-up without sacrificing accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficient MTGNN training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyang Li, Hamed Bolandi, Mahdi Masmoudi, Talal Salem, Nizar Lajnef, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti</p>
<p>Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) ensures the safety and longevity of structures like buildings and bridges. As the volume and scale of structures and the impact of their failure continue to grow, there is a dire need for SHM techniques that are scalable, inexpensive, can operate passively without human intervention, and are customized for each mechanical structure without the need for complex baseline models. We present MIDAS, a novel "deploy-and-forget" approach for automated detection and localization of damage in structures. It is a synergistic integration of entirely passive measurements from inexpensive sensors, data compression, and a mechanics-informed autoencoder. Once deployed, MIDAS continuously learns and adapts a bespoke baseline model for each structure, learning from its undamaged state's response characteristics. After learning from just 3 hours of data, it can autonomously detect and localize different types of unforeseen damage. Results from numerical simulations and experiments indicate that incorporating the mechanical characteristics into the autoencoder allows for up to a 35% improvement in the detection and localization of minor damage over a standard autoencoder. Our approach holds significant promise for reducing human intervention and inspection costs while enabling proactive and preventive maintenance strategies. This will extend the lifespan, reliability, and sustainability of civil infrastructures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masatoshi Uehara, Yulai Zhao, Kevin Black, Ehsan Hajiramezanali, Gabriele Scalia, Nathaniel Lee Diamant, Alex M Tseng, Sergey Levine, Tommaso Biancalani</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at modeling complex data distributions, including those of images, proteins, and small molecules. However, in many cases, our goal is to model parts of the distribution that maximize certain properties: for example, we may want to generate images with high aesthetic quality, or molecules with high bioactivity. It is natural to frame this as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, in which the objective is to fine-tune a diffusion model to maximize a reward function that corresponds to some property. Even with access to online queries of the ground-truth reward function, efficiently discovering high-reward samples can be challenging: they might have a low probability in the initial distribution, and there might be many infeasible samples that do not even have a well-defined reward (e.g., unnatural images or physically impossible molecules). In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning procedure that efficiently explores on the manifold of feasible samples. We present a theoretical analysis providing a regret guarantee, as well as empirical validation across three domains: images, biological sequences, and molecules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Wang, Zhen Tan, Xinyu Zhao, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu, Jundong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph generation generally aims to create new graphs that closely align with a specific graph distribution. Existing works often implicitly capture this distribution through the optimization of generators, potentially overlooking the intricacies of the distribution itself. Furthermore, these approaches generally neglect the insights offered by the learned distribution for graph generation. In contrast, in this work, we propose a novel self-conditioned graph generation framework designed to explicitly model graph distributions and employ these distributions to guide the generation process. We first perform self-conditioned modeling to capture the graph distributions by transforming each graph sample into a low-dimensional representation and optimizing a representation generator to create new representations reflective of the learned distribution. Subsequently, we leverage these bootstrapped representations as self-conditioned guidance for the generation process, thereby facilitating the generation of graphs that more accurately reflect the learned distributions. We conduct extensive experiments on generic and molecular graph datasets across various fields. Our framework demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art graph generation methods in terms of graph quality and fidelity to training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Menabue, Emanuele Frascaroli, Matteo Boschini, Enver Sangineto, Lorenzo Bonicelli, Angelo Porrello, Simone Calderara</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-tuning methods for Continual Learning (CL) freeze a large pre-trained model and train a few parameter vectors termed prompts. Most of these methods organize these vectors in a pool of key-value pairs and use the input image as query to retrieve the prompts (values). However, as keys are learned while tasks progress, the prompting selection strategy is itself subject to catastrophic forgetting, an issue often overlooked by existing approaches. For instance, prompts introduced to accommodate new tasks might end up interfering with previously learned prompts. To make the selection strategy more stable, we leverage a foundation model (CLIP) to select our prompts within a two-level adaptation mechanism. Specifically, the first level leverages a standard textual prompt pool for the CLIP textual encoder, leading to stable class prototypes. The second level, instead, uses these prototypes along with the query image as keys to index a second pool. The retrieved prompts serve to adapt a pre-trained ViT, granting plasticity. In doing so, we also propose a novel residual mechanism to transfer CLIP semantics to the ViT layers. Through extensive analysis on established CL benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art CL approaches and the zero-shot CLIP test. Notably, our findings hold true even for datasets with a substantial domain gap w.r.t. the pre-training knowledge of the backbone model, as showcased by experiments on satellite imagery and medical datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feras Saad, Jacob Burnim, Colin Carroll, Brian Patton, Urs K\"oster, Rif A. Saurous, Matthew Hoffman</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatiotemporal datasets, which consist of spatially-referenced time series, are ubiquitous in many scientific and business-intelligence applications, such as air pollution monitoring, disease tracking, and cloud-demand forecasting. As modern datasets continue to increase in size and complexity, there is a growing need for new statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics and scalable enough to handle large prediction problems. This work presents the Bayesian Neural Field (BayesNF), a domain-general statistical model for inferring rich probability distributions over a spatiotemporal domain, which can be used for data-analysis tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and variography. BayesNF integrates a novel deep neural network architecture for high-capacity function estimation with hierarchical Bayesian inference for robust uncertainty quantification. By defining the prior through a sequence of smooth differentiable transforms, posterior inference is conducted on large-scale data using variationally learned surrogates trained via stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate BayesNF against prominent statistical and machine-learning baselines, showing considerable improvements on diverse prediction problems from climate and public health datasets that contain tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements. The paper is accompanied with an open-source software package (https://github.com/google/bayesnf) that is easy-to-use and compatible with modern GPU and TPU accelerators on the JAX machine learning platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip Matthias Winter, Maria Wimmer, David Major, Dimitrios Lenis, Astrid Berg, Theresa Neubauer, Gaia Romana De Paolis, Johannes Novotny, Sophia Ulonska, Katja B\"uhler</p>
<p>Abstract: This work addresses flexibility in deep learning by means of transductive reasoning. For adaptation to new data and tasks, e.g., in continual learning, existing methods typically involve tuning learnable parameters or complete re-training from scratch, rendering such approaches unflexible in practice. We argue that the notion of separating computation from memory by the means of transduction can act as a stepping stone for solving these issues. We therefore propose PARMESAN (parameter-free memory search and transduction), a scalable method which leverages a memory module for solving dense prediction tasks. At inference, hidden representations in memory are being searched to find corresponding patterns. In contrast to other methods that rely on continuous training of learnable parameters, PARMESAN learns via memory consolidation simply by modifying stored contents. Our method is compatible with commonly used architectures and canonically transfers to 1D, 2D, and 3D grid-based data. The capabilities of our approach are demonstrated at the complex task of continual learning. PARMESAN learns by 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than established baselines while being on par in terms of predictive performance, hardware-efficiency, and knowledge retention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenbang Xiao, Yu Wang, Shunyu Liu, Huiqiong Wang, Mingli Song, Tongya Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The burdensome training costs on large-scale graphs have aroused significant interest in graph condensation, which involves tuning Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on a small condensed graph for use on the large-scale original graph. Existing methods primarily focus on aligning key metrics between the condensed and original graphs, such as gradients, output distribution and trajectories of GNNs, yielding satisfactory performance on downstream tasks. However, these complex metrics necessitate intricate external parameters and can potentially disrupt the optimization process of the condensation graph, making the condensation process highly demanding and unstable. Motivated by the recent success of simplified models across various domains, we propose a simplified approach to metric alignment in graph condensation, aiming to reduce unnecessary complexity inherited from intricate metrics. We introduce the Simple Graph Condensation (SimGC) framework, which aligns the condensed graph with the original graph from the input layer to the prediction layer, guided by a pre-trained Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) model on the original graph. Importantly, SimGC eliminates external parameters and exclusively retains the target condensed graph during the condensation process. This straightforward yet effective strategy achieves a significant speedup of up to 10 times compared to existing graph condensation methods while performing on par with state-of-the-art baselines. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SimGC in prediction accuracy, condensation time, and generalization capability.

<p>Abstract: Exploring the graph latent structures has not garnered much attention in the graph generative research field. Yet, exploiting the latent space is as crucial as working on the data space for discrete data such as graphs. However, previous methods either failed to preserve the permutation symmetry of graphs or lacked an effective approaches to model appropriately within the latent space. To mitigate those issues, we propose a simple, yet effective discrete latent graph diffusion generative model. Our model, namely GLAD, not only overcomes the drawbacks of existing latent approaches, but also alleviates inherent issues present in diffusion methods applied on the graph space. We validate our generative model on the molecular benchmark datasets, on which it demonstrates competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Yue, Jonathan Li, Sixue Xing, Md Zabirul Islam, Bolun Xia, Tianfan Fu, Jintai Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The clinical trial process, a critical phase in drug development, is essential for developing new treatments. The primary goal of interventional clinical trials is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of drug-based treatments for specific diseases. However, these trials are often lengthy, labor-intensive, and expensive. The duration of a clinical trial significantly impacts overall costs, making efficient timeline management crucial for controlling budgets and ensuring the economic feasibility of research. To address this issue, We propose TrialDura, a machine learning-based method that estimates the duration of clinical trials using multimodal data, including disease names, drug molecules, trial phases, and eligibility criteria. Then, we encode them into Bio-BERT embeddings specifically tuned for biomedical contexts to provide a deeper and more relevant semantic understanding of clinical trial data. Finally, the model's hierarchical attention mechanism connects all of the embeddings to capture their interactions and predict clinical trial duration. Our proposed model demonstrated superior performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.04 years and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.39 years compared to the other models, indicating more accurate clinical trial duration prediction.

<p>Abstract: Distinct from human cognitive processing, deep neural networks trained by backpropagation can be easily fooled by adversarial examples. To design a semantically meaningful representation learning, we discard backpropagation, and instead, propose a local contrastive learning, where the representation for the inputs bearing the same label shrink (akin to boson) in hidden layers, while those of different labels repel (akin to fermion). This layer-wise learning is local in nature, being biological plausible. A statistical mechanics analysis shows that the target fermion-pair-distance is a key parameter. Moreover, the application of this local contrastive learning to MNIST benchmark dataset demonstrates that the adversarial vulnerability of standard perceptron can be greatly mitigated by tuning the target distance, i.e., controlling the geometric separation of prototype manifolds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is an important research topic in artificial intelligence. Over the past few decades, researchers have made remarkable progress by increasing the dataset size and building more effective algorithms. However, due to problems such as complex environments and inaccurate annotations, current systems are hard to meet the demands of practical applications. Therefore, we organize the MER series of competitions to promote the development of this field. Last year, we launched MER2023, focusing on three interesting topics: multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning. In this year's MER2024, besides expanding the dataset size, we further introduce a new track around open-vocabulary emotion recognition. The main purpose of this track is that existing datasets usually fix the label space and use majority voting to enhance the annotator consistency. However, this process may lead to inaccurate annotations, such as ignoring non-majority or non-candidate labels. In this track, we encourage participants to generate any number of labels in any category, aiming to describe emotional states as accurately as possible.

Further, we develop two approaches: a rule-based and an Reinforcement Learning (RL) based eco-driving system, with both using the approach link and information from conflicting CVs for speed optimization. A fair comparison of rule-based and RL-based approaches is performed to explore RL as a viable alternative to classical optimization. Results show that both approaches outperform the baseline. Improvements significantly increase with growing traffic volumes, leading to best results on average being obtained at high volumes. Near capacity, performance deteriorates, indicating limited applicability at capacity limits. Examining different CV penetration rates, a decline in performance is observed, but with substantial results still being achieved at lower CV rates. RL agents can discover effective policies for speed optimization in dynamic roundabout settings, but they do not offer a substantial advantage over classical approaches, especially at higher traffic volumes or lower CV penetration rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojun Liang, Prayag Tiwari, Slawomir Nowaczyk, Stefan Byttner</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocong Rao, Minlin Zeng, Xuejiao Zhao, Chunyan Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing global population affected by neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which traditionally require extensive healthcare resources and human effort for medical diagnosis and monitoring. As a crucial disease-related motor symptom, human gait can be exploited to characterize different NDs. The current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models enable automatic gait analysis for NDs identification and classification, opening a new avenue to facilitate faster and more cost-effective diagnosis of NDs. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress of machine learning and deep learning based AI techniques applied to diagnosis of five typical NDs through gait. We provide an overview of the process of AI-assisted NDs diagnosis, and present a systematic taxonomy of existing gait data and AI models. Meanwhile, a novel quality evaluation criterion is proposed to quantitatively assess the quality of existing studies. Through an extensive review and analysis of 164 studies, we identify and discuss the challenges, potential solutions, and future directions in this field. Finally, we envision the prospective utilization of 3D skeleton data for human gait representation and the development of more efficient AI models for NDs diagnosis. We provide a public resource repository to track and facilitate developments in this emerging field: https://github.com/Kali-Hac/AI4NDD-Survey.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingchi Jiang, Rujia Shen, Boran Wang, Yi Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is characterized by insulin deficiency and blood glucose (BG) control issues. The state-of-the-art solution for continuous BG control is reinforcement learning (RL), where an agent can dynamically adjust exogenous insulin doses in time to maintain BG levels within the target range. However, due to the lack of action guidance, the agent often needs to learn from randomized trials to understand misleading correlations between exogenous insulin doses and BG levels, which can lead to instability and unsafety. To address these challenges, we propose an introspective RL based on Counterfactual Invertible Neural Networks (CINN). We use the pre-trained CINN as a frozen introspective block of the RL agent, which integrates forward prediction and counterfactual inference to guide the policy updates, promoting more stable and safer BG control. Constructed based on interpretable causal order, CINN employs bidirectional encoders with affine coupling layers to ensure invertibility while using orthogonal weight normalization to enhance the trainability, thereby ensuring the bidirectional differentiability of network parameters. We experimentally validate the accuracy and generalization ability of the pre-trained CINN in BG prediction and counterfactual inference for action. Furthermore, our experimental results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained CINN in guiding RL policy updates for more accurate and safer BG control.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the complex landscape of hematologic samples such as peripheral blood or bone marrow derived from flow cytometry (FC) data, cell-level prediction presents profound challenges. This work explores injecting hierarchical prior knowledge into graph neural networks (GNNs) for single-cell multi-class classification of tabular cellular data. By representing the data as graphs and encoding hierarchical relationships between classes, we propose our hierarchical plug-in method to be applied to several GNN models, namely, FCHC-GNN, and effectively designed to capture neighborhood information crucial for single-cell FC domain. Extensive experiments on our cohort of 19 distinct patients, demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical biological constraints boosts performance significantly across multiple metrics compared to baseline GNNs without such priors. The proposed approach highlights the importance of structured inductive biases for gaining improved generalization in complex biological prediction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiyoung Seong, Seonghyun Park, Seonghwan Kim, Woo Youn Kim, Sungsoo Ahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding transition paths between meta-stable states in molecular systems is fundamental for material design and drug discovery. However, sampling these paths via unbiased molecular dynamics simulations is computationally prohibitive due to the high energy barriers between the meta-stable states. Recent machine learning approaches are often restricted to simple systems or rely on collective variables (CVs) extracted from expensive domain knowledge. In this work, we propose to leverage generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to sample transition paths without relying on CVs. We reformulate the problem as amortized energy-based sampling over transition paths and train a neural bias potential by minimizing the squared log-ratio between the target distribution and the generator, derived from the flow matching objective of GFlowNets. Our evaluation on three proteins (Alanine Dipeptide, Polyproline Helix, and Chignolin) demonstrates that our approach, called TPS-GFN, generates more realistic and diverse transition paths than the previous CV-free machine learning approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Zhao, Linnan Wang, Tian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying deep learning models requires taking into consideration neural network metrics such as model size, inference latency, and #FLOPs, aside from inference accuracy. This results in deep learning model designers leveraging multi-objective optimization to design effective deep neural networks in multiple criteria. However, applying multi-objective optimizations to neural architecture search (NAS) is nontrivial because NAS tasks usually have a huge search space, along with a non-negligible searching cost. This requires effective multi-objective search algorithms to alleviate the GPU costs. In this work, we implement a novel multi-objectives optimizer based on a recently proposed meta-algorithm called LaMOO on NAS tasks. In a nutshell, LaMOO speedups the search process by learning a model from observed samples to partition the search space and then focusing on promising regions likely to contain a subset of the Pareto frontier. Using LaMOO, we observe an improvement of more than 200% sample efficiency compared to Bayesian optimization and evolutionary-based multi-objective optimizers on different NAS datasets. For example, when combined with LaMOO, qEHVI achieves a 225% improvement in sample efficiency compared to using qEHVI alone in NasBench201. For real-world tasks, LaMOO achieves 97.36% accuracy with only 1.62M #Params on CIFAR10 in only 600 search samples. On ImageNet, our large model reaches 80.4% top-1 accuracy with only 522M #FLOPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Zhao, Yunzhuo Liu, Bo Jiang, Tian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to increase carbon efficiency for the model design process. The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS. For open-domain NAS tasks, CE-NAS achieves SOTA results with 97.35% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.68M parameters and a carbon consumption of 38.53 lbs of CO2. On ImageNet, our searched model achieves 80.6% top-1 accuracy with a 0.78 ms TensorRT latency using FP16 on NVIDIA V100, consuming only 909.86 lbs of CO2, making it comparable to other one-shot-based NAS baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlie Hou, Akshat Shrivastava, Hongyuan Zhan, Rylan Conway, Trang Le, Adithya Sagar, Giulia Fanti, Daniel Lazar</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device training is currently the most common approach for training machine learning (ML) models on private, distributed user data. Despite this, on-device training has several drawbacks: (1) most user devices are too small to train large models on-device, (2) on-device training is communication- and computation-intensive, and (3) on-device training can be difficult to debug and deploy. To address these problems, we propose Private Evolution-Text (PrE-Text), a method for generating differentially private (DP) synthetic textual data. First, we show that across multiple datasets, training small models (models that fit on user devices) with PrE-Text synthetic data outperforms small models trained on-device under practical privacy regimes ($\epsilon=1.29$, $\epsilon=7.58$). We achieve these results while using 9$\times$ fewer rounds, 6$\times$ less client computation per round, and 100$\times$ less communication per round. Second, finetuning large models on PrE-Text's DP synthetic data improves large language model (LLM) performance on private data across the same range of privacy budgets. Altogether, these results suggest that training on DP synthetic data can be a better option than training a model on-device on private distributed data.

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces E(n) Equivariant Message Passing Cellular Networks (EMPCNs), an extension of E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks to CW-complexes. Our approach addresses two aspects of geometric message passing networks: 1) enhancing their expressiveness by incorporating arbitrary cells, and 2) achieving this in a computationally efficient way with a decoupled EMPCNs technique. We demonstrate that EMPCNs achieve close to state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks without the need for steerability, including many-body predictions and motion capture. Moreover, ablation studies confirm that decoupled EMPCNs exhibit stronger generalization capabilities than their non-topologically informed counterparts. These findings show that EMPCNs can be used as a scalable and expressive framework for higher-order message passing in geometric and topological graphs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Zandieh, Majid Daliri, Insu Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Serving LLMs requires substantial memory due to the storage requirements of Key-Value (KV) embeddings in the KV cache, which grows with sequence length. An effective approach to compress KV cache is quantization. However, traditional quantization methods face significant memory overhead due to the need to store quantization constants (at least a zero point and a scale) in full precision per data block. Depending on the block size, this overhead can add 1 or 2 bits per quantized number. We introduce QJL, a new quantization approach that consists of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform followed by sign-bit quantization. In contrast to existing methods, QJL eliminates memory overheads by removing the need for storing quantization constants. We propose an asymmetric estimator for the inner product of two vectors and demonstrate that applying QJL to one vector and a standard JL transform without quantization to the other provides an unbiased estimator with minimal distortion. We have developed an efficient implementation of the QJL sketch and its corresponding inner product estimator, incorporating a lightweight CUDA kernel for optimized computation. When applied across various LLMs and NLP tasks to quantize the KV cache to only 3 bits, QJL demonstrates a more than fivefold reduction in KV cache memory usage without compromising accuracy, all while achieving faster runtime.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Renpu Liu, Cong Shen, Jing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated representation learning (FRL) is a popular personalized federated learning (FL) framework where clients work together to train a common representation while retaining their personalized heads. Existing studies, however, largely focus on the over-parameterized regime. In this paper, we make the initial efforts to investigate FRL in the under-parameterized regime, where the FL model is insufficient to express the variations in all ground-truth models. We propose a novel FRL algorithm FLUTE, and theoretically characterize its sample complexity and convergence rate for linear models in the under-parameterized regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first FRL algorithm with provable performance guarantees in this regime. FLUTE features a data-independent random initialization and a carefully designed objective function that aids the distillation of subspace spanned by the global optimal representation from the misaligned local representations. On the technical side, we bridge low-rank matrix approximation techniques with the FL analysis, which may be of broad interest. We also extend FLUTE beyond linear representations. Experimental results demonstrate that FLUTE outperforms state-of-the-art FRL solutions in both synthetic and real-world tasks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05666">General Distribution Learning: A theoretical framework for Deep Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Binchuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces General Distribution Learning (GD learning), a novel theoretical learning framework designed to address a comprehensive range of machine learning and statistical tasks, including classification, regression, and parameter estimation. GD learning focuses on estimating the true underlying probability distribution of dataset and using models to fit the estimated parameters of the distribution. The learning error in GD learning is thus decomposed into two distinct categories: estimation error and fitting error. The estimation error, which stems from the constraints of finite sampling, limited prior knowledge, and the estimation algorithm's inherent limitations, quantifies the discrepancy between the true distribution and its estimate. The fitting error can be attributed to model's capacity limitation and the performance limitation of the optimization algorithm, which evaluates the deviation of the model output from the fitted objective. To address the challenge of non-convexity in the optimization of learning error, we introduce the standard loss function and demonstrate that, when employing this function, global optimal solutions in non-convex optimization can be approached by minimizing the gradient norm and the structural error. Moreover, we demonstrate that the estimation error is determined by the uncertainty of the estimate $q$, and propose the minimum uncertainty principle to obtain an optimal estimate of the true distribution. We further provide upper bounds for the estimation error, fitting error, and learning error within the GD learning framework. Ultimately, our findings are applied to offer theoretical explanations for several unanswered questions on deep learning, including overparameterization, non-convex optimization, flat minima, dynamic isometry condition and other techniques in deep learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyue Qin, Yunsheng Bai, Atefeh Sohrabizadeh, Zijian Ding, Ziniu Hu, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, domain-specific accelerators (DSAs) have gained popularity for applications such as deep learning and autonomous driving. To facilitate DSA designs, programmers use high-level synthesis (HLS) to compile a high-level description written in C/C++ into a design with low-level hardware description languages that eventually synthesize DSAs on circuits. However, creating a high-quality HLS design still demands significant domain knowledge, particularly in microarchitecture decisions expressed as \textit{pragmas}. Thus, it is desirable to automate such decisions with the help of machine learning for predicting the quality of HLS designs, requiring a deeper understanding of the program that consists of original code and pragmas. Naturally, these programs can be considered as sequence data. In addition, these programs can be compiled and converted into a control data flow graph (CDFG). But existing works either fail to leverage both modalities or combine the two in shallow or coarse ways. We propose ProgSG, a model that allows interaction between the source code sequence modality and the graph modality in a deep and fine-grained way. To alleviate the scarcity of labeled designs, a pre-training method is proposed based on a suite of compiler's data flow analysis tasks. Experimental results show that ProgSG reduces the RMSE of design performance predictions by up to $22\%$, and identifies designs with an average of $1.10\times$ and $1.26\times$ (up to $8.17\times$ and $13.31\times$) performance improvement in design space exploration (DSE) task compared to HARP and AutoDSE, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vector fields are widely used to represent and model flows for many science and engineering applications. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture for learning tangent vector fields that are intrinsically defined on manifold surfaces embedded in 3D. Previous approaches to learning vector fields on surfaces treat vectors as multi-dimensional scalar fields, using traditional scalar-valued architectures to process channels individually, thus fail to preserve fundamental intrinsic properties of the vector field. The core idea of this work is to introduce a trainable vector heat diffusion module to spatially propagate vector-valued feature data across the surface, which we incorporate into our proposed architecture that consists of vector-valued neurons. Our architecture is invariant to rigid motion of the input, isometric deformation, and choice of local tangent bases, and is robust to discretizations of the surface. We evaluate our Vector Heat Network on triangle meshes, and empirically validate its invariant properties. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the useful industrial application of quadrilateral mesh generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongjie Duan, Zhiying Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Compared to static functional connectivity, dynamic functional connectivity provides more detailed temporal information. The traditional sliding window method constructs functional connectivity matrices by applying a moving time window across the entire time series to calculate correlations between brain regions. However, as a method of feature extraction, it exhibits significant limitations, such as the dependency of feature dimensions on the window length and the generation of features lacking information from other time points within the window. This paper presents RandCon, a novel method for calculating dynamic functional connectivity (DFC), which employs randomly generated multi-dimensional convolution kernels. This method performs convolution operations directly on the BOLD signal without the need for learning, extracting functional connectivity features. Compared to the sliding window method, RandCon shows notable improvements in performance on simulated data, particularly in terms of temporal accuracy and noise resistance. Results from real data indicate that this method maintains stability within short time windows and better identifies gender differences. Furthermore, we propose a more comprehensive theoretical framework, the multi-dimensional convolution method, where the sliding window method and its variants are specific cases of this method. The proposed method is straightforward and efficient, significantly broadening the scope of dynamic functional connectivity research and offering substantial theoretical and practical potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Li, Wenchao Xu, Haozhao Wang, Ruixuan Li, Yining Qi, Jingcai Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper focuses on Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL) where each client continues to learn incremental tasks where their domain shifts from each other. We propose a novel adaptive knowledge matching-based personalized FDIL approach (pFedDIL) which allows each client to alternatively utilize appropriate incremental task learning strategy on the correlation with the knowledge from previous tasks. More specifically, when a new task arrives, each client first calculates its local correlations with previous tasks. Then, the client can choose to adopt a new initial model or a previous model with similar knowledge to train the new task and simultaneously migrate knowledge from previous tasks based on these correlations. Furthermore, to identify the correlations between the new task and previous tasks for each client, we separately employ an auxiliary classifier to each target classification model and propose sharing partial parameters between the target classification model and the auxiliary classifier to condense model parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of which results demonstrate that pFedDIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 14.35\% in terms of average accuracy of all tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tongzhou Liao, Barnab\'as P\'oczos</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become fundamental in graph-structured deep learning. Key paradigms of modern GNNs include message passing, graph rewiring, and Graph Transformers. This paper introduces Graph-Rewiring Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture that combines the advantages of these three paradigms. GRASS rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph, enhancing long-range information propagation while preserving structural features of the input graph. It also employs a unique additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data, providing a graph inductive bias while remaining computationally efficient. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, confirming its practical efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Scott Freitas, Jovan Kalajdjieski, Amir Gharib, Robert McCann</p>
<p>Abstract: Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security incidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we developed Copilot Guided Response (CGR), an industry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key tasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by identifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the incident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive; and (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M annotated incidents. By enabling researchers and practitioners to conduct research on real-world data, GUIDE advances the state of cybersecurity and supports the development of next-generation machine learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Achintya Kundu, Rhui Dih Lee, Laura Wynter, Raghu Kiran Ganti, Mayank Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Padding is often used in tuning LLM models by adding special tokens to shorter training examples to match the length of the longest sequence in each batch. While this ensures uniformity for batch processing, it introduces inefficiencies by including irrelevant padding tokens in the computation and wastes GPU resources. On the other hand, the Hugging Face SFT trainer offers the option to use packing to combine multiple training examples up to the maximum sequence length. This allows for maximal utilization of GPU resources. However, without proper masking of each packed training example, attention will not be computed correctly when using SFT trainer. We enable and then analyse packing and Flash Attention with proper attention masking of each example and show the benefits of this training paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changyu Gao, Andrew Lowy, Xingyu Zhou, Stephen J. Wright</p>
<p>Abstract: We revisit the problem of federated learning (FL) with private data from people who do not trust the server or other silos/clients. In this context, every silo (e.g. hospital) has data from several people (e.g. patients) and needs to protect the privacy of each person's data (e.g. health records), even if the server and/or other silos try to uncover this data. Inter-Silo Record-Level Differential Privacy (ISRL-DP) prevents each silo's data from being leaked, by requiring that silo i's communications satisfy item-level differential privacy. Prior work arXiv:2106.09779 characterized the optimal excess risk bounds for ISRL-DP algorithms with homogeneous (i.i.d.) silo data and convex loss functions. However, two important questions were left open: (1) Can the same excess risk bounds be achieved with heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) silo data? (2) Can the optimal risk bounds be achieved with fewer communication rounds? In this paper, we give positive answers to both questions. We provide novel ISRL-DP FL algorithms that achieve the optimal excess risk bounds in the presence of heterogeneous silo data. Moreover, our algorithms are more communication-efficient than the prior state-of-the-art. For smooth loss functions, our algorithm achieves the optimal excess risk bound and has communication complexity that matches the non-private lower bound. Additionally, our algorithms are more computationally efficient than the previous state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: Addressing strategies for managing vacant, abandoned, and deteriorated (VAD) properties is important for maintaining healthy communities. Yet, the process of identifying these properties can be difficult. Here, we create a human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITLML) model called VADecide and apply it to a parcel-level case study in Savannah, Georgia. The results show a higher prediction accuracy than was achieved when using a machine learning model without human input in the training. The HITLML approach also reveals differences between machine vs. human-generated results. Our findings contribute to knowledge about the advantages and challenges of HITLML in urban planning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongnan Jin, Yali Liu, Qiuzhi Song, Xunju Ma, Yue Liu, Dehao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the real world, as the complexity of optimization problems continues to increase, there is an urgent need to research more efficient optimization methods. Current optimization algorithms excel in solving problems with a fixed number of dimensions. However, their efficiency in searching dynamic multi-dimensional spaces is unsatisfactory. In response to the challenge of cross-dimensional search in multi-dimensional spaces with varying numbers of dimensions, this study proposes a new optimization algorithm-Dynamic Dimension Wrapping (DDW) algorithm. Firstly, by utilizing the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm and Euclidean distance, a mapping relationship between different time series across dimensions is established, thus creating a fitness function suitable for dimensionally dynamic multi-dimensional space. Additionally, DDW introduces a novel, more efficient cross-dimensional search mechanism for dynamic multidimensional spaces. Finally, through comparative tests with 31 optimization algorithms in dynamic multidimensional space search, the results demonstrate that DDW exhibits outstanding search efficiency and provides search results closest to the actual optimal solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dengke Han, Mingyu Yan, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan, Ninghui Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Owing to their remarkable representation capabilities for heterogeneous graph data, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted in many critical real-world domains such as recommendation systems and medical analysis. Prior to their practical application, identifying the optimal HGNN model parameters tailored to specific tasks through extensive training is a time-consuming and costly process. To enhance the efficiency of HGNN training, it is essential to characterize and analyze the execution semantics and patterns within the training process to identify performance bottlenecks. In this study, we conduct an in-depth quantification and analysis of two mainstream HGNN training scenarios, including single-GPU and multi-GPU distributed training. Based on the characterization results, we disclose the performance bottlenecks and their underlying causes in different HGNN training scenarios and provide optimization guidelines from both software and hardware perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Zhang, Siyu Zhao, Zeen Song, Huijie Guo, Jianqi Zhang, Changwen Zheng, Wenwen Qiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in various applications. A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiuyuan Cheng, Boris Landa</p>
<p>Abstract: Bi-stochastic normalization provides an alternative normalization of graph Laplacians in graph-based data analysis and can be computed efficiently by Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) iterations. This paper proves the convergence of bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to manifold (weighted-)Laplacian with rates, when $n$ data points are i.i.d. sampled from a general $d$-dimensional manifold embedded in a possibly high-dimensional space. Under certain joint limit of $n \to \infty$ and kernel bandwidth $\epsilon \to 0$, the point-wise convergence rate of the graph Laplacian operator (under 2-norm) is proved to be $ O( n^{-1/(d/2+3)})$ at finite large $n$ up to log factors, achieved at the scaling of $\epsilon \sim n^{-1/(d/2+3)} $. When the manifold data are corrupted by outlier noise, we theoretically prove the graph Laplacian point-wise consistency which matches the rate for clean manifold data plus an additional term proportional to the boundedness of the inner-products of the noise vectors among themselves and with data vectors. Motivated by our analysis, which suggests that not exact bi-stochastic normalization but an approximate one will achieve the same consistency rate, we propose an approximate and constrained matrix scaling problem that can be solved by SK iterations with early termination. Numerical experiments support our theoretical results and show the robustness of bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to high-dimensional outlier noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishita Dasgupta, Andrew K. Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Hannah R. Sheahan, Antonia Creswell, Dharshan Kumaran, James L. McClelland, Felix Hill</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is a key ability for an intelligent system. Large language models (LMs) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks, but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. For example, human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable "content effects"; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns play a central role in debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models $\unicode{x2014}$ whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge $\unicode{x2014}$ similarly mix content into their answers to logical problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art large language models, as well as humans, and find that the language models reflect many of the same patterns observed in humans across these tasks $\unicode{x2014}$ like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected both in answer patterns, and in lower-level features like the relationship between model answer distributions and human response times. Our findings have implications for understanding both these cognitive effects in humans, and the factors that contribute to language model performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeguang Qin, Yilin Yang, Fengxiao Tang, Xin Yao, Ming Zhao, Nei Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) plays a pivotal role as a comprehensive foundational network communication infrastructure, presenting opportunities for highly efficient global data transmission. Nonetheless, given SAGIN's unique characteristics as a dynamically heterogeneous network, conventional network optimization methodologies encounter challenges in satisfying the stringent requirements for network latency and stability inherent to data transmission within this network environment. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of differentiated federated reinforcement learning (DFRL) to solve the traffic offloading problem in SAGIN, i.e., using multiple agents to generate differentiated traffic offloading policies. Considering the differentiated characteristics of each region of SAGIN, DFRL models the traffic offloading policy optimization process as the process of solving the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) problem. The paper proposes a novel Differentiated Federated Soft Actor-Critic (DFSAC) algorithm to solve the problem. The DFSAC algorithm takes the network packet delay as the joint reward value and introduces the global trend model as the joint target action-value function of each agent to guide the update of each agent's policy. The simulation results demonstrate that the traffic offloading policy based on the DFSAC algorithm achieves better performance in terms of network throughput, packet loss rate, and packet delay compared to the traditional federated reinforcement learning approach and other baseline approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature selection in clustering is a hard task which involves simultaneously the discovery of relevant clusters as well as relevant variables with respect to these clusters. While feature selection algorithms are often model-based through optimised model selection or strong assumptions on the data distribution, we introduce a discriminative clustering model trying to maximise a geometry-aware generalisation of the mutual information called GEMINI with a simple l1 penalty: the Sparse GEMINI. This algorithm avoids the burden of combinatorial feature subset exploration and is easily scalable to high-dimensional data and large amounts of samples while only designing a discriminative clustering model. We demonstrate the performances of Sparse GEMINI on synthetic datasets and large-scale datasets. Our results show that Sparse GEMINI is a competitive algorithm and has the ability to select relevant subsets of variables with respect to the clustering without using relevance criteria or prior hypotheses.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including decision-making and genomics. The exponential growth of raw genomic data over the past two decades has exceeded the capacity of manual analysis, leading to a growing interest in automatic data analysis and processing. RL algorithms are capable of learning from experience with minimal human supervision, making them well-suited for genomic data analysis and interpretation. One of the key benefits of using RL is the reduced cost associated with collecting labeled training data, which is required for supervised learning. While there have been numerous studies examining the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in genomics, this survey focuses exclusively on the use of RL in various genomics research fields, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), genome assembly, and sequence alignment. We present a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on the application of RL in genomics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. We then discuss potential research directions that are worthy of future exploration, including the development of more sophisticated reward functions as RL heavily depends on the accuracy of the reward function, the integration of RL with other machine learning techniques, and the application of RL to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we present our findings and conclude by summarizing the current state of the field and the future outlook for RL in genomics.</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D shape generation techniques leveraging deep learning have garnered significant interest from both the computer vision and architectural design communities, promising to enrich the content in the virtual environment. However, research on virtual architectural design remains limited, particularly regarding designer-AI collaboration and deep learning-assisted design. In our survey, we reviewed 149 related articles (81.2% of articles published between 2019 and 2023) covering architectural design, 3D shape techniques, and virtual environments. Through scrutinizing the literature, we first identify the principles of virtual architecture and illuminate its current production challenges, including datasets, multimodality, design intuition, and generative frameworks. We then introduce the latest approaches to designing and generating virtual buildings leveraging 3D shape generation and summarize four characteristics of various approaches to virtual architecture. Based on our analysis, we expound on four research agendas, including agency, communication, user consideration, and integrating tools. Additionally, we highlight four important enablers of ubiquitous interaction with immersive systems in deep learning-assisted architectural generation. Our work contributes to fostering understanding between designers and deep learning techniques, broadening access to designer-AI collaboration. We advocate for interdisciplinary efforts to address this timely research topic, facilitating content designing and generation in the virtual environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Liang, Lijun Sheng, Zhengbo Wang, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of vision-language models, such as CLIP, has spurred a significant research effort towards their application for downstream supervised learning tasks. Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised fine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class names associated with ground truth labels. This paper explores a realistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario, considering the presence of out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes within the unlabeled data. In particular, we focus on simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution detection and the recognition of instances associated with known classes. To tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leverages sample-level confidence to approximately minimize the conditional entropy of confident instances and maximize the marginal entropy of less confident instances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompt, UEO incorporates optimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch of CLIP. Extensive experiments across 15 domains and 4 different types of prior knowledge validate the effectiveness of UEO compared to baseline methods. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/tim-learn/UEO}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Phuong Duy Huynh, Son Hoang Dau, Xiaodong Li, Phuc Luong, Emanuele Viterbo</p>
<p>Abstract: The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on the Ethereum blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto investors. A few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of which detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code. This contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not robust because a Ponzi developer can fool a detection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit distribution logic that cannot be detected. On the contrary, a transaction-based approach could improve the robustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are harder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection models achieve fairly low accuracy. In this paper, we aim to improve the accuracy of the transaction-based models by employing time-series features, which turn out to be crucial in capturing the life-time behaviour a Ponzi application but were completely overlooked in previous works. We propose a new set of 85 features (22 known account-based and 63 new time-series features), which allows off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to achieve up to 30% higher F1-scores compared to existing works.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Debenedetti, Giorgio Severi, Nicholas Carlini, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Matthew Jagielski, Milad Nasr, Eric Wallace, Florian Tram\`er</p>
<p>Abstract: Most current approaches for protecting privacy in machine learning (ML) assume that models exist in a vacuum. Yet, in reality, these models are part of larger systems that include components for training data filtering, output monitoring, and more. In this work, we introduce privacy side channels: attacks that exploit these system-level components to extract private information at far higher rates than is otherwise possible for standalone models. We propose four categories of side channels that span the entire ML lifecycle (training data filtering, input preprocessing, output post-processing, and query filtering) and allow for enhanced membership inference, data extraction, and even novel threats such as extraction of users' test queries. For example, we show that deduplicating training data before applying differentially-private training creates a side-channel that completely invalidates any provable privacy guarantees. We further show that systems which block language models from regenerating training data can be exploited to exfiltrate private keys contained in the training set--even if the model did not memorize these keys. Taken together, our results demonstrate the need for a holistic, end-to-end privacy analysis of machine learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiho Park, Yo Joong Choe, Victor Veitch</p>
<p>Abstract: Informally, the 'linear representation hypothesis' is the idea that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in some representation space. In this paper, we address two closely related questions: What does "linear representation" actually mean? And, how do we make sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similarity or projection) in the representation space? To answer these, we use the language of counterfactuals to give two formalizations of "linear representation", one in the output (word) representation space, and one in the input (sentence) space. We then prove these connect to linear probing and model steering, respectively. To make sense of geometric notions, we use the formalization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean) inner product that respects language structure in a sense we make precise. Using this causal inner product, we show how to unify all notions of linear representation. In particular, this allows the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations of concepts, the connection to interpretation and control, and the fundamental role of the choice of inner product.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andres Pollano, Anupam Chaudhuri, Anj Simmons</p>
<p>Abstract: To safeguard machine learning systems that operate on textual data against out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs that could cause unpredictable behaviour, we explore the use of topological features of self-attention maps from transformer-based language models to detect when input text is out of distribution. Self-attention forms the core of transformer-based language models, dynamically assigning vectors to words based on context, thus in theory our methodology is applicable to any transformer-based language model with multihead self-attention. We evaluate our approach on BERT and compare it to a traditional OOD approach using CLS embeddings. Our results show that our approach outperforms CLS embeddings in distinguishing in-distribution samples from far-out-of-domain samples, but struggles with near or same-domain datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Pin Huang, Kai-Po Chang, Chung-Ting Tsai, Yung-Hsuan Lai, Fu-En Yang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models aims to disable pre-trained diffusion models from generating images related to a target concept. To perform reliable concept erasure, the properties of robustness and locality are desirable. The former refrains the model from producing images associated with the target concept for any paraphrased or learned prompts, while the latter preserves its ability in generating images with non-target concepts. In this paper, we propose Reliable Concept Erasing via Lightweight Erasers (Receler). It learns a lightweight Eraser to perform concept erasing while satisfying the above desirable properties through the proposed concept-localized regularization and adversarial prompt learning scheme. Experiments with various concepts verify the superiority of Receler over previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kamel Alrashedy, Abdullah Aljasser, Pradyumna Tambwekar, Matthew Gombolay</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive proficiency in code generation. Unfortunately, these models share a weakness with their human counterparts: producing code that inadvertently has security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized attackers to access sensitive data or systems, which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Feedback-Driven Security Patching (FDSP), where LLMs automatically refine generated, vulnerable code. Our approach leverages automatic static code analysis to empower the LLM to generate and implement potential solutions to address vulnerabilities. We address the research communitys needs for safe code generation by introducing a large-scale dataset, PythonSecurityEval, covering the diversity of real-world applications, including databases, websites and operating systems. We empirically validate that FDSP outperforms prior work that uses self-feedback from LLMs by up to 17.6% through our procedure that injects targeted, external feedback.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Li, Chunhe Xia, Wei Liu, Chen Chen, Tianbo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy and security in the parameter transmission process of federated learning are currently among the most prominent concerns. However, there are two thorny problems caused by unprotected communication methods: "parameter-leakage" and "inefficient-communication". This article proposes Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FBChain) model for federated learning parameter communication to overcome the above two problems. First, we utilize the immutability of blockchain to store the global model and hash value of local model parameters in case of tampering during the communication process, protect data privacy by encrypting parameters, and verify data consistency by comparing the hash values of local parameters, thus addressing the "parameter-leakage" problem. Second, the Proof of Weighted Link Speed (PoWLS) consensus algorithm comprehensively selects nodes with the higher weighted link speed to aggregate global model and package blocks, thereby solving the "inefficient-communication" problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FBChain model and its ability to improve model communication efficiency in federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pilhyeon Lee, Hyeran Byun</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to localize moments relevant to a language description. Recently, DETR-like approaches achieved notable progress by predicting the center and length of a target moment. However, they suffer from the issue of center misalignment raised by the inherent ambiguity of moment centers, leading to inaccurate predictions. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel boundary-oriented moment formulation. In our paradigm, the model no longer needs to find the precise center but instead suffices to predict any anchor point within the interval, from which the boundaries are directly estimated. Based on this idea, we design a boundary-aligned moment detection transformer, equipped with a dual-pathway decoding process. Specifically, it refines the anchor and boundaries within parallel pathways using global and boundary-focused attention, respectively. This separate design allows the model to focus on desirable regions, enabling precise refinement of moment predictions. Further, we propose a quality-based ranking method, ensuring that proposals with high localization qualities are prioritized over incomplete ones. Experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Pilhyeon/BAM-DETR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peishen Yan, Hao Wang, Tao Song, Yang Hua, Ruhui Ma, Ningxin Hu, Mohammad R. Haghighat, Haibing Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is becoming a popular paradigm for leveraging distributed data and preserving data privacy. However, due to the distributed characteristic, FL systems are vulnerable to Byzantine attacks that compromised clients attack the global model by uploading malicious model updates. With the development of layer-level and parameter-level fine-grained attacks, the attacks' stealthiness and effectiveness have been significantly improved. The existing defense mechanisms solely analyze the model-level statistics of individual model updates uploaded by clients to mitigate Byzantine attacks, which are ineffective against fine-grained attacks due to unawareness or overreaction. To address this problem, we propose SkyMask, a new attack-agnostic robust FL system that firstly leverages fine-grained learnable masks to identify malicious model updates at the parameter level. Specifically, the FL server freezes and multiplies the model updates uploaded by clients with the parameter-level masks, and trains the masks over a small clean dataset (i.e., root dataset) to learn the subtle difference between benign and malicious model updates in a high-dimension space. Our extensive experiments involve different models on three public datasets under state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks, where the results show that SkyMask achieves up to 14% higher testing accuracy compared with SOTA defense strategies under the same attacks and successfully defends against attacks with malicious clients of a high fraction up to 80%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luwei Bai, Yaohua Hu, Hao Wang, Xiaoqi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of non-convex and non-smooth sparse optimization problems, which encompass most existing nonconvex sparsity-inducing terms. We show the second-order optimality conditions only depend on the nonzeros of the stationary points. We propose two damped iterative reweighted algorithms including the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ algorithm (DIRL$_1$) and the iteratively reweighted $\ell_2$ (DIRL$_2$) algorithm, to solve these problems. For DIRL$_1$, we show the reweighted $\ell_1$ subproblem has support identification property so that DIRL$_1$ locally reverts to a gradient descent algorithm around a stationary point. For DIRL$_2$, we show the solution map of the reweighted $\ell_2$ subproblem is differentiable and Lipschitz continuous everywhere. Therefore, the map of DIRL$_1$ and DIRL$_2$ and their inverse are Lipschitz continuous, and the strict saddle points are their unstable fixed points. By applying the stable manifold theorem, these algorithms are shown to converge only to local minimizers with randomly initialization when the strictly saddle point property is assumed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Shah, Soumadeep Saha, Purba Mukherjee, Utpal Garain, Supratik Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the prospect of reconstructing the ''cosmic distance ladder'' of the Universe using a novel deep learning framework called LADDER - Learning Algorithm for Deep Distance Estimation and Reconstruction. LADDER is trained on the apparent magnitude data from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae compilation, incorporating the full covariance information among data points, to produce predictions along with corresponding errors. After employing several validation tests with a number of deep learning models, we pick LADDER as the best performing one. We then demonstrate applications of our method in the cosmological context, including serving as a model-independent tool for consistency checks for other datasets like baryon acoustic oscillations, calibration of high-redshift datasets such as gamma ray bursts, and use as a model-independent mock catalog generator for future probes. Our analysis advocates for careful consideration of machine learning techniques applied to cosmological contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Wettig, Aatmik Gupta, Saumya Malik, Danqi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting high-quality pre-training data is important for creating capable language models, but existing methods rely on simple heuristics. We introduce QuRating, a method for selecting pre-training data that can capture human intuitions about data quality. In this paper, we investigate four qualities - writing style, required expertise, facts & trivia, and educational value - and find that LLMs are able to discern these qualities, especially when making pairwise judgments of texts. We train a QuRater model to learn scalar ratings from pairwise judgments, and use it to annotate a 260B training corpus with quality ratings for each of the four criteria. In our experiments, we select 30B tokens according to the different quality ratings and train 1.3B-parameter language models on the selected data. We find that it is important to balance quality and diversity. When we sample using quality ratings as logits over documents, our models obtain lower perplexity and stronger in-context learning performance than baselines. Our best model is based on educational value and performs similarly to a model trained with uniform sampling for 50% more steps. Beyond data selection, we use the quality ratings to construct a training curriculum which improves performance without changing the training dataset. We extensively analyze the quality ratings and discuss their characteristics, biases, and wider implications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore the potential of self-supervised learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for electron microscopy datasets. We show how self-supervised pretraining facilitates efficient fine-tuning for a spectrum of downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, denoising, noise \& background removal, and super-resolution. Experimentation with varying model complexities and receptive field sizes reveals the remarkable phenomenon that fine-tuned models of lower complexity consistently outperform more complex models with random weight initialization. We demonstrate the versatility of self-supervised pretraining across various downstream tasks in the context of electron microscopy, allowing faster convergence and better performance. We conclude that self-supervised pretraining serves as a powerful catalyst, being especially advantageous when limited annotated data are available and efficient scaling of computational cost is important.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present DrJAX, a JAX-based library designed to support large-scale distributed and parallel machine learning algorithms that use MapReduce-style operations. DrJAX leverages JAX's sharding mechanisms to enable native targeting of TPUs and state-of-the-art JAX runtimes, including Pathways. DrJAX embeds building blocks for MapReduce computations as primitives in JAX. This enables three key benefits. First, DrJAX computations can be translated directly to XLA HLO, enabling flexible integration with a wide array of ML training platforms. Second, DrJAX computations are fully differentiable. Last, DrJAX computations can be interpreted out to existing batch-processing compute systems, including traditional MapReduce systems like Apache Beam and cross-device compute systems like those powering federated learning applications. We show that DrJAX provides an easily programmable, performant, and scalable framework for parallelized algorithm development.

<p>Abstract: In spite of their huge success, transformer models remain difficult to scale in depth. In this work, we develop a unified signal propagation theory and provide formulae that govern the moments of the forward and backward signal through the transformer model. Our framework can be used to understand and mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients, rank collapse, and instability associated with high attention scores. We also propose DeepScaleLM, an initialization and scaling scheme that conserves unit output/gradient moments throughout the model, enabling the training of very deep models with 1000 layers. We find that transformer models could be much deeper - our deep models with fewer parameters outperform shallow models in Language Modeling, Speech Translation, and Image Classification, across encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder variants, for both Pre-LN and Post-LN transformers, for multiple datasets and model sizes. These improvements also translate into improved performance on downstream Question Answering tasks and improved robustness for Image Classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atif Belal, Akhil Meethal, Francisco Perdigon Romero, Marco Pedersoli, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain adaptation methods for object detection (OD) strive to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts by promoting feature alignment across source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) allows leveraging multiple annotated source datasets and unlabeled target data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection model. Most state-of-the-art MSDA methods for OD perform feature alignment in a class-agnostic manner. This is challenging since the objects have unique modal information due to variations in object appearance across domains. A recent prototype-based approach proposed a class-wise alignment, yet it suffers from error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels that can negatively affect adaptation with imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-based class-conditioned alignment method for MSDA that aligns instances of each object category across domains. In particular, an attention module coupled with an adversarial domain classifier allows learning domain-invariant and class-specific instance representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking MSDA datasets indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to class imbalance using a conceptually simple class-conditioning method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Sarthak Kumar Maharana, Yunhui Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, there is a growing focus on deep neural network (DNN) watermarking techniques. These methods are used to facilitate the verification of ownership for a target DNN model to protect intellectual property. One of the most widely employed watermarking techniques involves embedding a trigger set into the source model. Unfortunately, existing methodologies based on trigger sets are still susceptible to functionality-stealing attacks, potentially enabling adversaries to steal the functionality of the source model without a reliable means of verifying ownership. In this paper, we first introduce a novel perspective on trigger set-based watermarking methods from a feature learning perspective. Specifically, we demonstrate that by selecting data exhibiting multiple features, also referred to as \emph{multi-view data}, it becomes feasible to effectively defend functionality stealing attacks. Based on this perspective, we introduce a novel watermarking technique based on Multi-view dATa, called MAT, for efficiently embedding watermarks within DNNs. This approach involves constructing a trigger set with multi-view data and incorporating a simple feature-based regularization method for training the source model. We validate our method across various benchmarks and demonstrate its efficacy in defending against model extraction attacks, surpassing relevant baselines by a significant margin.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Huo, Yikai Wang, Xuelin Qian, Yun Wang, Chong Li, Jianfeng Feng, Yanwei Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent fMRI-to-image approaches mainly focused on associating fMRI signals with specific conditions of pre-trained diffusion models. These approaches, while producing high-quality images, capture only a limited aspect of the complex information in fMRI signals and offer little detailed control over image creation. In contrast, this paper proposes to directly modulate the generation process of diffusion models using fMRI signals. Our approach, NeuroPictor, divides the fMRI-to-image process into three steps: i) fMRI calibrated-encoding, to tackle multi-individual pre-training for a shared latent space to minimize individual difference and enable the subsequent multi-subject training; ii) fMRI-to-image multi-subject pre-training, perceptually learning to guide diffusion model with high- and low-level conditions across different individuals; iii) fMRI-to-image single-subject refining, similar with step ii but focus on adapting to particular individual. NeuroPictor extracts high-level semantic features from fMRI signals that characterizing the visual stimulus and incrementally fine-tunes the diffusion model with a low-level manipulation network to provide precise structural instructions. By training with about 67,000 fMRI-image pairs from various individuals, our model enjoys superior fMRI-to-image decoding capacity, particularly in the within-subject setting, as evidenced in benchmark datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Zubair Irshad, Sergey Zakharov, Vitor Guizilini, Adrien Gaidon, Zsolt Kira, Rares Ambrus</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural fields excel in computer vision and robotics due to their ability to understand the 3D visual world such as inferring semantics, geometry, and dynamics. Given the capabilities of neural fields in densely representing a 3D scene from 2D images, we ask the question: Can we scale their self-supervised pretraining, specifically using masked autoencoders, to generate effective 3D representations from posed RGB images. Owing to the astounding success of extending transformers to novel data modalities, we employ standard 3D Vision Transformers to suit the unique formulation of NeRFs. We leverage NeRF's volumetric grid as a dense input to the transformer, contrasting it with other 3D representations such as pointclouds where the information density can be uneven, and the representation is irregular. Due to the difficulty of applying masked autoencoders to an implicit representation, such as NeRF, we opt for extracting an explicit representation that canonicalizes scenes across domains by employing the camera trajectory for sampling. Our goal is made possible by masking random patches from NeRF's radiance and density grid and employing a standard 3D Swin Transformer to reconstruct the masked patches. In doing so, the model can learn the semantic and spatial structure of complete scenes. We pretrain this representation at scale on our proposed curated posed-RGB data, totaling over 1.8 million images. Once pretrained, the encoder is used for effective 3D transfer learning. Our novel self-supervised pretraining for NeRFs, NeRF-MAE, scales remarkably well and improves performance on various challenging 3D tasks. Utilizing unlabeled posed 2D data for pretraining, NeRF-MAE significantly outperforms self-supervised 3D pretraining and NeRF scene understanding baselines on Front3D and ScanNet datasets with an absolute performance improvement of over 20% AP50 and 8% AP25 for 3D object detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread availability of LLMs, there remains a substantial gap in their capabilities and availability across diverse languages. One approach to address these issues has been to take an existing pre-trained LLM and continue to train it on new languages. While prior works have experimented with language adaptation, many questions around best practices and methodology have not been covered. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation into the adaptation of LLMs to new languages. Our study covers the key components in this process, including vocabulary extension, direct preference optimization and the data scarcity problem for human alignment in low-resource languages. We scale these experiments across 9 languages and 2 parameter scales (7B and 70B). We compare our models against Llama 2, Aya-101, XGLM, BLOOM and existing language experts, outperforming all prior published baselines. Additionally, all evaluation code and checkpoints are made public to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manav Nitin Kapadnis, Sohan Patnaik, Abhilash Nandy, Sourjyadip Ray, Pawan Goyal, Debdoot Sheet</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (R2Gen) demonstrates how Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can automate the creation of accurate and coherent radiological reports. Existing methods often hallucinate details in text-based reports that don't accurately reflect the image content. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel strategy, SERPENT-VLM (SElf Refining Radiology RePort GENeraTion using Vision Language Models), which improves the R2Gen task by integrating a self-refining mechanism into the MLLM framework. We employ a unique self-supervised loss that leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations of the generated radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling objective, to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize and align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image and the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as LLaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust against noisy images. A qualitative case study emphasizes the significant advancements towards more sophisticated MLLM frameworks for R2Gen, opening paths for further research into self-supervised refinement in the medical imaging domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minguk Kang, Richard Zhang, Connelly Barnes, Sylvain Paris, Suha Kwak, Jaesik Park, Eli Shechtman, Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method to distill a complex multistep diffusion model into a single-step conditional GAN student model, dramatically accelerating inference, while preserving image quality. Our approach interprets diffusion distillation as a paired image-to-image translation task, using noise-to-image pairs of the diffusion model's ODE trajectory. For efficient regression loss computation, we propose E-LatentLPIPS, a perceptual loss operating directly in diffusion model's latent space, utilizing an ensemble of augmentations. Furthermore, we adapt a diffusion model to construct a multi-scale discriminator with a text alignment loss to build an effective conditional GAN-based formulation. E-LatentLPIPS converges more efficiently than many existing distillation methods, even accounting for dataset construction costs. We demonstrate that our one-step generator outperforms cutting-edge one-step diffusion distillation models -- DMD, SDXL-Turbo, and SDXL-Lightning -- on the zero-shot COCO benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sushant Agarwal, Gautam Kamath, Mahbod Majid, Argyris Mouzakis, Rose Silver, Jonathan Ullman</p>
<p>Abstract: We study person-level differentially private (DP) mean estimation in the case where each person holds multiple samples. DP here requires the usual notion of distributional stability when $\textit{all}$ of a person's datapoints can be modified. Informally, if $n$ people each have $m$ samples from an unknown $d$-dimensional distribution with bounded $k$-th moments, we show that people are necessary and sufficient to estimate the mean up to distance $\alpha$ in $\ell_2$-norm under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (and its common relaxations). In the multivariate setting, we give computationally efficient algorithms under approximate-DP and computationally inefficient algorithms under pure DP, and our nearly matching lower bounds hold for the most permissive case of approximate DP. Our computationally efficient estimators are based on the standard clip-and-noise framework, but the analysis for our setting requires both new algorithmic techniques and new analyses. In particular, our new bounds on the tails of sums of independent, vector-valued, bounded-moments random variables may be of interest.
  \[n = \tilde \Theta\left(\frac{d}{\alpha^2 m} + \frac{d}{\alpha m^{1/2} \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\alpha^{k/(k-1)} m \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\]</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmalya Thakur, Vanessa Su, Mingchen Shao, Kesha A. Patel, Hongseok Jeong, Victoria Knieling, Andrew Bian</p>
<p>Abstract: The work of this paper presents a dataset that contains the data of 4011 videos about the ongoing outbreak of measles published on 264 websites on the internet between January 1, 2024, and May 31, 2024. The dataset is available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/40s8-xf63. These websites primarily include YouTube and TikTok, which account for 48.6% and 15.2% of the videos, respectively. The remainder of the websites include Instagram and Facebook as well as the websites of various global and local news organizations. For each of these videos, the URL of the video, title of the post, description of the post, and the date of publication of the video are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis (using VADER), subjectivity analysis (using TextBlob), and fine-grain sentiment analysis (using DistilRoBERTa-base) of the video titles and video descriptions were performed. This included classifying each video title and video description into (i) one of the sentiment classes i.e. positive, negative, or neutral, (ii) one of the subjectivity classes i.e. highly opinionated, neutral opinionated, or least opinionated, and (iii) one of the fine-grain sentiment classes i.e. fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset for the training and testing of machine learning algorithms for performing sentiment analysis or subjectivity analysis in this field as well as for other applications. Finally, this paper also presents a list of open research questions that may be investigated using this dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amil Dravid, Yossi Gandelsman, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Rameen Abdal, Gordon Wetzstein, Alexei A. Efros, Kfir Aberman</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the space of weights spanned by a large collection of customized diffusion models. We populate this space by creating a dataset of over 60,000 models, each of which is a base model fine-tuned to insert a different person's visual identity. We model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term weights2weights. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, as each point in the space corresponds to an identity, sampling a set of weights from it results in a model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard). These edits persist in appearance across generated samples. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space reconstructs a realistic identity, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models behaves as an interpretable latent space of identities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edoardo Debenedetti, Jie Zhang, Mislav Balunovi\'c, Luca Beurer-Kellner, Marc Fischer, Florian Tram\`er</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents aim to solve complex tasks by combining text-based reasoning with external tool calls. Unfortunately, AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where data returned by external tools hijacks the agent to execute malicious tasks. To measure the adversarial robustness of AI agents, we introduce AgentDojo, an evaluation framework for agents that execute tools over untrusted data. To capture the evolving nature of attacks and defenses, AgentDojo is not a static test suite, but rather an extensible environment for designing and evaluating new agent tasks, defenses, and adaptive attacks. We populate the environment with 97 realistic tasks (e.g., managing an email client, navigating an e-banking website, or making travel bookings), 629 security test cases, and various attack and defense paradigms from the literature. We find that AgentDojo poses a challenge for both attacks and defenses: state-of-the-art LLMs fail at many tasks (even in the absence of attacks), and existing prompt injection attacks break some security properties but not all. We hope that AgentDojo can foster research on new design principles for AI agents that solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner. We release the code for AgentDojo at https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanting Dong, Keming Lu, Chengpeng Li, Tingyu Xia, Bowen Yu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: One core capability of large language models (LLMs) is to follow natural language instructions. However, the issue of automatically constructing high-quality training data to enhance the complex instruction-following abilities of LLMs without manual annotation remains unresolved. In this paper, we introduce AutoIF, the first scalable and reliable method for automatically generating instruction-following training data. AutoIF transforms the validation of instruction-following data quality into code verification, requiring LLMs to generate instructions, the corresponding code to check the correctness of the instruction responses, and unit test samples to verify the code's correctness. Then, execution feedback-based rejection sampling can generate data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training. AutoIF achieves significant improvements across three training algorithms, SFT, Offline DPO, and Online DPO, when applied to the top open-source LLMs, Qwen2 and LLaMA3, in self-alignment and strong-to-weak distillation settings. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QwenLM/AutoIF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for point forecasting in univariate random walks often fail to surpass naive benchmarks due to data unpredictability. This study introduces a novel forecasting method that fuses movement prediction (binary classification) with naive forecasts for accurate one-step-ahead point forecasting in univariate random walks. The method's efficacy is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulations, and real-world data experiments. It reliably outperforms naive forecasts with moderate movement prediction accuracies, such as 0.55, and is superior to baseline models such as the ARIMA, linear regression, MLP, and LSTM networks in forecasting the S&P 500 index and Bitcoin prices. This method is particularly advantageous when accurate point predictions are challenging but accurate movement predictions are attainable, translating movement predictions into point forecasts in random walk contexts.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18676">Understand What LLM Needs: Dual Preference Alignment for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanting Dong, Yutao Zhu, Chenghao Zhang, Zechen Wang, Zhicheng Dou, Ji-Rong Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating the hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs). However, the difficulty of aligning the retriever with the diverse LLMs' knowledge preferences inevitably poses an inevitable challenge in developing a reliable RAG system. To address this issue, we propose DPA-RAG, a universal framework designed to align diverse knowledge preferences within RAG systems. Specifically, we initially introduce a preference knowledge construction pipline and incorporate five novel query augmentation strategies to alleviate preference data scarcity. Based on preference data, DPA-RAG accomplishes both external and internal preference alignment: 1) It jointly integrate pair-wise, point-wise, and contrastive preference alignment abilities into the reranker, achieving external preference alignment among RAG components. 2) It further introduces a pre-aligned stage before vanilla Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), enabling LLMs to implicitly capture knowledge aligned with their reasoning preferences, achieving LLMs' internal alignment. Experimental results across four knowledge-intensive QA datasets demonstrate that DPA-RAG outperforms all baselines and seamlessly integrates both black-box and open-sourced LLM readers. Further qualitative analysis and discussions also provide empirical guidance for achieving reliable RAG systems. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/dongguanting/DPA-RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahsan Mahmood, Junier Oliva, Martin Styner</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in medical imaging remain critical challenges in healthcare. This paper introduces Spatial-MSMA (Multiscale Score Matching Analysis), a novel unsupervised method for anomaly localization in volumetric brain MRIs. Building upon the MSMA framework, our approach incorporates spatial information and conditional likelihoods to enhance anomaly detection capabilities. We employ a flexible normalizing flow model conditioned on patch positions and global image features to estimate patch-wise anomaly scores. The method is evaluated on a dataset of 1,650 T1- and T2-weighted brain MRIs from typically developing children, with simulated lesions added to the test set. Spatial-MSMA significantly outperforms existing methods, including reconstruction-based, generative-based, and interpretation-based approaches, in lesion detection and segmentation tasks. Our model achieves superior performance in both distance-based metrics (99th percentile Hausdorff Distance: $7.05 \pm 0.61$, Mean Surface Distance: $2.10 \pm 0.43$) and component-wise metrics (True Positive Rate: $0.83 \pm 0.01$, Positive Predictive Value: $0.96 \pm 0.01$). These results demonstrate Spatial-MSMA's potential for accurate and interpretable anomaly localization in medical imaging, with implications for improved diagnosis and treatment planning in clinical settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Price, Arjun Panickssery, Sam Bowman, Asa Cooper Stickland</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoors are hidden behaviors that are only triggered once an AI system has been deployed. Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community and inspire continued innovation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicola Muca Cirone, Jad Hamdan, Cristopher Salvi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a unified approach to obtain scaling limits of neural networks using the genus expansion technique from random matrix theory. This approach begins with a novel expansion of neural networks which is reminiscent of Butcher series for ODEs, and is obtained through a generalisation of Fa\`a di Bruno's formula to an arbitrary number of compositions. In this expansion, the role of monomials is played by random multilinear maps indexed by directed graphs whose edges correspond to random matrices, which we call operator graphs. This expansion linearises the effect of the activation functions, allowing for the direct application of Wick's principle to compute the expectation of each of its terms. We then determine the leading contribution to each term by embedding the corresponding graphs onto surfaces, and computing their Euler characteristic. Furthermore, by developing a correspondence between analytic and graphical operations, we obtain similar graph expansions for the neural tangent kernel as well as the input-output Jacobian of the original neural network, and derive their infinite-width limits with relative ease. Notably, we find explicit formulae for the moments of the limiting singular value distribution of the Jacobian. We then show that all of these results hold for networks with more general weights, such as general matrices with i.i.d. entries satisfying moment assumptions, complex matrices and sparse matrices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyeok Kim, Dongyoon Wee, Dan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Motion-oriented Compositional Neural Radiance Fields (MoCo-NeRF), a framework designed to perform free-viewpoint rendering of monocular human videos via novel non-rigid motion modeling approach. In the context of dynamic clothed humans, complex cloth dynamics generate non-rigid motions that are intrinsically distinct from skeletal articulations and critically important for the rendering quality. The conventional approach models non-rigid motions as spatial (3D) deviations in addition to skeletal transformations. However, it is either time-consuming or challenging to achieve optimal quality due to its high learning complexity without a direct supervision. To target this problem, we propose a novel approach of modeling non-rigid motions as radiance residual fields to benefit from more direct color supervision in the rendering and utilize the rigid radiance fields as a prior to reduce the complexity of the learning process. Our approach utilizes a single multiresolution hash encoding (MHE) to concurrently learn the canonical T-pose representation from rigid skeletal motions and the radiance residual field for non-rigid motions. Additionally, to further improve both training efficiency and usability, we extend MoCo-NeRF to support simultaneous training of multiple subjects within a single framework, thanks to our effective design for modeling non-rigid motions. This scalability is achieved through the integration of a global MHE and learnable identity codes in addition to multiple local MHEs. We present extensive results on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap, clearly demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both single- and multi-subject settings.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12288">Information-Theoretic Foundations for Machine Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Jun Jeon, Benjamin Van Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: The staggering progress of machine learning in the past decade has been a sight to behold. In retrospect, it is both remarkable and unsettling that these milestones were achievable with little to no rigorous theory to guide experimentation. Despite this fact, practitioners have been able to guide their future experimentation via observations from previous large-scale empirical investigations. However, alluding to Plato's Allegory of the cave, it is likely that the observations which form the field's notion of reality are but shadows representing fragments of that reality. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework which attempts to answer what exists outside of the cave. To the theorist, we provide a framework which is mathematically rigorous and leaves open many interesting ideas for future exploration. To the practitioner, we provide a framework whose results are very intuitive, general, and which will help form principles to guide future investigations. Concretely, we provide a theoretical framework rooted in Bayesian statistics and Shannon's information theory which is general enough to unify the analysis of many phenomena in machine learning. Our framework characterizes the performance of an optimal Bayesian learner, which considers the fundamental limits of information. Throughout this work, we derive very general theoretical results and apply them to derive insights specific to settings ranging from data which is independently and identically distributed under an unknown distribution, to data which is sequential, to data which exhibits hierarchical structure amenable to meta-learning. We conclude with a section dedicated to characterizing the performance of misspecified algorithms. These results are exciting and particularly relevant as we strive to overcome increasingly difficult machine learning challenges in this endlessly complex world.</p>
