<p><b>Authors:</b> Tofara Moyo</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel method for learning hierarchical abstractions that prioritize competing objectives, leading to improved global expected rewards. Our approach employs a secondary rewarding agent with multiple scalar outputs, each associated with a distinct level of abstraction. The traditional agent then learns to maximize these outputs in a hierarchical manner, conditioning each level on the maximization of the preceding level. We derive an equation that orders these scalar values and the global reward by priority, inducing a hierarchy of needs that informs goal formation. Experimental results on the Pendulum v1 environment demonstrate superior performance compared to a baseline implementation.We achieved state of the art results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leila Gheisi, Henry Chu, Raju Gottumukkala, Xingquan Zhu, Mengyu Wang, Min Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in automated disease classification significantly reduces healthcare costs and improves the accessibility of services. However, this transformation has given rise to concerns about the fairness of AI, which disproportionately affects certain groups, particularly patients from underprivileged populations. Recently, a number of methods and large-scale datasets have been proposed to address group performance disparities. Although these methods have shown effectiveness in disease classification tasks, they may fall short in ensuring fair prediction of disease progression, mainly because of limited longitudinal data with diverse demographics available for training a robust and equitable prediction model. In this paper, we introduce TransFair to enhance demographic fairness in progression prediction for ocular diseases. TransFair aims to transfer a fairness-enhanced disease classification model to the task of progression prediction with fairness preserved. Specifically, we train a fair EfficientNet, termed FairEN, equipped with a fairness-aware attention mechanism using extensive data for ocular disease classification. Subsequently, this fair classification model is adapted to a fair progression prediction model through knowledge distillation, which aims to minimize the latent feature distances between the classification and progression prediction models. We evaluate FairEN and TransFair for fairness-enhanced ocular disease classification and progression prediction using both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D retinal images. Extensive experiments and comparisons with models with and without considering fairness learning show that TransFair effectively enhances demographic equity in predicting ocular disease progression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingzheng Zhang, Lifeng Shen, Yimin Zheng, Shiyuan Piao, Ziyue Li, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively used for real-world time series forecasting due to their strong natural language understanding capabilities. However, aligning time series into semantic spaces of LLMs comes with high computational costs and inference complexity, particularly for long-range time series generation. Building on recent advancements in using linear models for time series, this paper introduces an LLM-enhanced mixture of linear experts for precise and efficient time series forecasting. This approach involves developing a mixture of linear experts with multiple lookback lengths and a new multimodal fusion mechanism. The use of a mixture of linear experts is efficient due to its simplicity, while the multimodal fusion mechanism adaptively combines multiple linear experts based on the learned features of the text modality from pre-trained large language models. In experiments, we rethink the need to align time series to LLMs by existing time-series large language models and further discuss their efficiency and effectiveness in time series forecasting. Our experimental results show that the proposed LeMoLE model presents lower prediction errors and higher computational efficiency than existing LLM models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00054">Less is More: Efficient Model Merging with Binary Task Switch</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Biqing Qi, Fangyuan Li, Zhen Wang, Junqi Gao, Dong Li, Peng Ye, Bowen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: As an effective approach to equip models with multi-task capabilities without additional training, model merging has garnered significant attention. However, existing methods face challenges of redundant parameter conflicts and the excessive storage burden of parameters. In this work, through controlled experiments, we reveal that for task vectors, only those parameters with magnitudes above a certain threshold contribute positively to the task, exhibiting a pulse-like characteristic. We then attempt leveraging this characteristic to binarize the task vectors and reduce storage overhead. Further controlled experiments show that the binarized task vectors incur almost no decrease in fine-tuning and merging performance, and even exhibit stronger performance improvements as the proportion of redundant parameters increases. Based on these insights, we propose Task Switch (T-Switch), which decomposes task vectors into three components: 1) an activation switch instantiated by a binarized mask vector, 2) a polarity switch instantiated by a binarized sign vector, and 3) a scaling knob instantiated by a scalar coefficient. By storing task vectors in a binarized form, T-Switch alleviates parameter conflicts while ensuring efficient task parameter storage. Furthermore, to enable automated switch combination in T-Switch, we further introduce Auto-Switch, which enables training-free switch combination via retrieval from a small query set. Experiments indicate that our methods achieve significant performance improvements over existing baselines, requiring only 1-3% of the storage space of full-precision parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Lin, Qingyu Song, Hong Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Tuning effective step sizes is crucial for the stability and efficiency of optimization algorithms. While adaptive coordinate-wise step sizes tuning methods have been explored in first-order methods, second-order methods still lack efficient techniques. Current approaches, including hypergradient descent and cutting plane methods, offer limited improvements or encounter difficulties in second-order contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Learning-to-Optimize (L2O) model within the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) framework, which leverages neural networks to predict optimal coordinate-wise step sizes. Our model integrates a theoretical foundation that establishes conditions for the stability and convergence of these step sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements over traditional backtracking line search and hypergradient descent-based methods, offering up to 7$\times$ faster and stable performance across diverse optimization tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuofan Wen, Shangtong Gui, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference acceleration of large language models (LLMs) has been put forward in many application scenarios and speculative decoding has shown its advantage in addressing inference acceleration. Speculative decoding usually introduces a draft model to assist the base LLM where the draft model produces drafts and the base LLM verifies the draft for acceptance or rejection. In this framework, the final inference speed is decided by the decoding speed of the draft model and the acceptance rate of the draft provided by the draft model. Currently the widely used draft models usually generate draft tokens for the next several positions in a non-autoregressive way without considering the correlations between draft tokens. Therefore, it has a high decoding speed but an unsatisfactory acceptance rate. In this paper, we focus on how to improve the performance of the draft model and aim to accelerate inference via a high acceptance rate. To this end, we propose a CTC-based draft model which strengthens the correlations between draft tokens during the draft phase, thereby generating higher-quality draft candidate sequences. Experiment results show that compared to strong baselines, the proposed method can achieve a higher acceptance rate and hence a faster inference speed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuesong Wang, Sharaf K. Magableh, Oraib Dawaghreh, Caisheng Wang, Jiaxuan Gong, Zhongyang Zhao, Michael H. Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual bidding plays an important role in two-settlement electric power markets, as it can reduce discrepancies between day-ahead and real-time markets. Renewable energy penetration increases volatility in electricity prices, making accurate forecasting critical for virtual bidders, reducing uncertainty and maximizing profits. This study presents a Transformer-based deep learning model to forecast the price spread between real-time and day-ahead electricity prices in the ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) market. The proposed model leverages various time-series features, including load forecasts, solar and wind generation forecasts, and temporal attributes. The model is trained under realistic constraints and validated using a walk-forward approach by updating the model every week. Based on the price spread prediction results, several trading strategies are proposed and the most effective strategy for maximizing cumulative profit under realistic market conditions is identified through backtesting. The results show that the strategy of trading only at the peak hour with a precision score of over 50% produces nearly consistent profit over the test period. The proposed method underscores the importance of an accurate electricity price forecasting model and introduces a new method of evaluating the price forecast model from a virtual bidder's perspective, providing valuable insights for future research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00069">Condense, Don&#x27;t Just Prune: Enhancing Efficiency and Performance in MoE Layer Pruning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Cao, Gen Li, Jie Ji, Jiaqi Zhang, Xiaolong Ma, Shiwei Liu, Lu Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) has garnered significant attention for their ability to scale up neural networks while utilizing the same or even fewer active parameters. However, MoE does not relieve the massive memory requirements of networks, which limits their practicality in real-world applications, especially in the era of large language models (LLMs). While recent work explores the possibility of removing entire layers of MoE to reduce memory, the performance degradation is still notable. In this paper, we propose Condense-MoE (CD-MoE} that, instead of dropping the entire MoE layer, condenses the big, sparse MoE layer into a small but dense layer with only a few experts that are activated for all tokens. Our approach is specifically designed for fine-grained MoE with shared experts, where Feed-Forward Networks are split into many small experts, with certain experts isolated to serve as shared experts that are always activated. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple MoE models such as DeepSeekMoE and QwenMoE on various benchmarks. Specifically, for the DeepSeekMoE-16B model, our approach maintains nearly 90% of the average accuracy while reducing memory usage by 30% and enhancing inference speed by 30%. Moreover, we show that with lightweight expert fine-tuning, the pruned model can achieve further improvements on specific tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Dang, Dianhui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recurrent stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) have shown great potential in modelling nonlinear dynamic systems with uncertainties. This paper presents an RSCN with hybrid regularization to enhance both the learning capacity and generalization performance of the network. Given a set of temporal data, the well-known least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is employed to identify the significant order variables. Subsequently, an improved RSCN with L2 regularization is introduced to approximate the residuals between the output of the target plant and the LASSO model. The output weights are updated in real-time through a projection algorithm, facilitating a rapid response to dynamic changes within the system. A theoretical analysis of the universal approximation property is provided, contributing to the understanding of the network's effectiveness in representing various complex nonlinear functions. Experimental results from a nonlinear system identification problem and two industrial predictive tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other models across all testing datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00071">COAP: Memory-Efficient Training with Correlation-Aware Gradient Projection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinqi Xiao, Shen Sang, Tiancheng Zhi, Jing Liu, Qing Yan, Linjie Luo, Bo Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large-scale neural networks in vision, and multimodal domains demands substantial memory resources, primarily due to the storage of optimizer states. While LoRA, a popular parameter-efficient method, reduces memory usage, it often suffers from suboptimal performance due to the constraints of low-rank updates. Low-rank gradient projection methods (e.g., GaLore, Flora) reduce optimizer memory by projecting gradients and moment estimates into low-rank spaces via singular value decomposition or random projection. However, they fail to account for inter-projection correlation, causing performance degradation, and their projection strategies often incur high computational costs. In this paper, we present COAP (Correlation-Aware Gradient Projection), a memory-efficient method that minimizes computational overhead while maintaining training performance. Evaluated across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks, COAP outperforms existing methods in both training speed and model performance. For LLaMA-1B, it reduces optimizer memory by 61% with only 2% additional time cost, achieving the same PPL as AdamW. With 8-bit quantization, COAP cuts optimizer memory by 81% and achieves 4x speedup over GaLore for LLaVA-v1.5-7B fine-tuning, while delivering higher accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Roberts, Ian Colwell, Clara Chew, Dallas Masters, Karl Nordstrom</p>
<p>Abstract: Muon Space (Muon) is building a constellation of small satellites, many of which will carry global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R) receivers. In preparation for the launch of this constellation, we have developed a generalized deep learning retrieval pipeline, which now produces operational GNSS-R near-surface soil moisture retrievals using data from NASA's Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission. In this article, we describe the input datasets, preprocessing methods, model architecture, development methods, and detail the soil moisture products generated from these retrievals. The performance of this product is quantified against in situ measurements and compared to both the target dataset (retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) satellite) and the v1.0 soil moisture product from the CYGNSS mission. The Muon Space product achieves improvements in spatial resolution over SMAP with comparable performance in many regions. An ubRMSE of 0.032 cm$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ for in situ soil moisture observations from SMAP core validation sites is shown, though performance is lower than SMAP's when comparing in forests and/or mountainous terrain. The Muon Space product outperforms the v1.0 CYGNSS soil moisture product in almost all aspects. This initial release serves as the foundation of our operational soil moisture product, which soon will additionally include data from Muon Space satellites.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Andrea Gargiulo, Donato Crisostomi, Maria Sofia Bucarelli, Simone Scardapane, Fabrizio Silvestri, Emanuele Rodol\`a</p>
<p>Abstract: Task Arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet effective method to merge models without additional training. However, by treating entire networks as flat parameter vectors, it overlooks key structural information and is susceptible to task interference. In this paper, we study task vectors at the layer level, focusing on task layer matrices and their singular value decomposition. In particular, we concentrate on the resulting singular vectors, which we refer to as Task Singular Vectors (TSV). Recognizing that layer task matrices are often low-rank, we propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a simple procedure that compresses them to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. We further leverage this low-rank space to define a new measure of task interference based on the interaction of singular vectors from different tasks. Building on these findings, we introduce TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that combines compression with interference reduction, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangli Li, Zhehao Zhou, Tuo Sun, Ping Tan, Li Zhang, Zhen Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: EEG signals have emerged as a powerful tool in affective brain-computer interfaces, playing a crucial role in emotion recognition. However, current deep transfer learning-based methods for EEG recognition face challenges due to the reliance of both source and target data in model learning, which significantly affect model performance and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework (PL-DCP) and introduce the concepts of feature disentanglement and prototype inference. The dual prototyping mechanism incorporates both domain and class prototypes: domain prototypes capture individual variations across subjects, while class prototypes represent the ideal class distributions within their respective domains. Importantly, the proposed PL-DCP framework operates exclusively with source data during training, meaning that target data remains completely unseen throughout the entire process. To address label noise, we employ a pairwise learning strategy that encodes proximity relationships between sample pairs, effectively reducing the influence of mislabeled data. Experimental validation on the SEED and SEED-IV datasets demonstrates that PL-DCP, despite not utilizing target data during training, achieves performance comparable to deep transfer learning methods that require both source and target data. This highlights the potential of PL-DCP as an effective and robust approach for EEG-based emotion recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching-Yi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved transformative success across a wide range of domains, revolutionizing fields such as healthcare, education, and human-computer interaction. However, the mechanisms driving AI's performance often remain opaque, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs), which have advanced at an unprecedented pace in recent years. Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o exemplify this evolution, integrating text, audio, and visual inputs to enable interaction across diverse domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, these models remain largely "black boxes," offering limited insight into how they process multi-modal information internally. This lack of transparency poses significant challenges, including systematic biases, flawed associations, and unintended behaviors, which require careful investigation. Understanding the decision-making processes of MLLMs is both beneficial and essential for mitigating these challenges and ensuring their reliable deployment in critical applications. GPT-4o was chosen as the focus of this study for its advanced multi-modal capabilities, which allow simultaneous processing of textual and visual information. These capabilities make it an ideal model for investigating the parallels and distinctions between machine-driven and human-driven visual perception. While GPT-4o performs effectively in tasks involving structured and complete data, its reliance on bottom-up processing, which involves a feature-by-feature analysis of sensory inputs, presents challenges when interpreting complex or ambiguous stimuli. This limitation contrasts with human vision, which is remarkably adept at resolving ambiguity and reconstructing incomplete information through high-level cognitive processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Physics-Informed model architecture that can be adapted to various backbone networks. The model incorporates physical information as additional input and is constrained by a Physics-Informed loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that the additional input of physical information substantially improve the model's ability with a increase in performance observed. Besides, the adoption of the Softplus activation function in the final two fully connected layers significantly enhances model performance. The incorporation of a Physics-Informed loss function has been shown to correct the model's predictions, bringing the back-projections closer to the actual inputs and reducing the errors associated with inversion algorithms. In this work, we have developed a Phantom Data Model to generate customized line integral diagnostic datasets and have also collected SXR diagnostic datasets from EAST and HL-2A.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Shi, Zheyuan Hu, Min Lin, Kenji Kawaguchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing neural networks with loss that contain high-dimensional and high-order differential operators
  is expensive to evaluate with back-propagation due to $\mathcal{O}(d^{k})$ scaling of the derivative tensor size and the $\mathcal{O}(2^{k-1}L)$ scaling in the computation graph, where $d$ is the dimension of the domain, $L$ is the number of ops in the forward computation graph, and $k$ is the derivative order. In previous works, the polynomial scaling in $d$ was addressed by amortizing the computation over the optimization process via randomization. Separately, the exponential scaling in $k$ for univariate functions ($d=1$) was addressed with high-order auto-differentiation (AD). In this work, we show how to efficiently perform arbitrary contraction of the derivative tensor of arbitrary order for multivariate functions, by properly constructing the input tangents to univariate high-order AD, which can be used to efficiently randomize any differential operator.
  When applied to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our method provides >1000$\times$ speed-up and >30$\times$ memory reduction over randomization with first-order AD, and we can now solve \emph{1-million-dimensional PDEs in 8 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU}.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuguang Li, Shaohua Wu, Liang Li, Songge Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this letter, we propose an energy-efficient split learning (SL) framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using geo-distributed personal data at the network edge, where LLMs are split and alternately across massive mobile devices and an edge server. Considering the device heterogeneity and channel dynamics in edge networks, a Cut lAyer and computing Resource Decision (CARD) algorithm is developed to minimize training delay and energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the average training delay and server's energy consumption by 70.8\% and 53.1\%, compared to the benchmarks, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrii Skliar, Ties van Rozendaal, Romain Lepert, Todor Boinovski, Mart van Baalen, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) LLMs have recently gained attention for their ability to enhance performance by selectively engaging specialized subnetworks or "experts" for each input. However, deploying MoEs on memory-constrained devices remains challenging, particularly when generating tokens sequentially with a batch size of one, as opposed to typical high-throughput settings involving long sequences or large batches. In this work, we optimize MoE on memory-constrained devices where only a subset of expert weights fit in DRAM. We introduce a novel cache-aware routing strategy that leverages expert reuse during token generation to improve cache locality. We evaluate our approach on language modeling, MMLU, and GSM8K benchmarks and present on-device results demonstrating 2$\times$ speedups on mobile devices, offering a flexible, training-free solution to extend MoE's applicability across real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Audibert, Aur\'elien Gauffre, Massih-Reza Amini</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-label classification, which involves assigning multiple labels to a single input, has emerged as a key area in both research and industry due to its wide-ranging applications. Designing effective loss functions is crucial for optimizing deep neural networks for this task, as they significantly influence model performance and efficiency. Traditional loss functions, which often maximize likelihood under the assumption of label independence, may struggle to capture complex label relationships. Recent research has turned to supervised contrastive learning, a method that aims to create a structured representation space by bringing similar instances closer together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. Although contrastive learning offers a promising approach, applying it to multi-label classification presents unique challenges, particularly in managing label interactions and data structure.
  In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of contrastive learning loss for multi-label classification across diverse settings. These include datasets with both small and large numbers of labels, datasets with varying amounts of training data, and applications in both computer vision and natural language processing.
  Our empirical results indicate that the promising outcomes of contrastive learning are attributable not only to the consideration of label interactions but also to the robust optimization scheme of the contrastive loss. Furthermore, while the supervised contrastive loss function faces challenges with datasets containing a small number of labels and ranking-based metrics, it demonstrates excellent performance, particularly in terms of Macro-F1, on datasets with a large number of labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Nguyen, Gautam Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akram Yoosoofsah</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting extubation failure in intensive care is challenging due to complex data and the severe consequences of inaccurate predictions. Machine learning shows promise in improving clinical decision-making but often fails to account for temporal patient trajectories and model interpretability, highlighting the need for innovative solutions.
  This study aimed to develop an actionable, interpretable prediction system for extubation failure using temporal modelling approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). A retrospective cohort study of 4,701 mechanically ventilated patients from the MIMIC-IV database was conducted. Data from the 6 hours before extubation, including static and dynamic features, were processed through novel techniques addressing data inconsistency and synthetic data challenges. Feature selection was guided by clinical relevance and literature benchmarks.
  Iterative experimentation involved training LSTM, TCN, and LightGBM models. Initial results showed a strong bias toward predicting extubation success, despite advanced hyperparameter tuning and static data inclusion. Data was stratified by sampling frequency to reduce synthetic data impacts, leading to a fused decision system with improved performance. However, all architectures yielded modest predictive power (AUC-ROC ~0.6; F1 <0.5) with no clear advantage in incorporating static data or additional features. Ablation analysis indicated minimal impact of individual features on model performance.
  This thesis highlights the challenges of synthetic data in extubation failure prediction and introduces strategies to mitigate bias, including clinician-informed preprocessing and novel feature subsetting. While performance was limited, the study provides a foundation for future work, emphasising the need for reliable, interpretable models to optimise ICU outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuma Kobayashi, Farid Ahmed, Syed Bahauddin Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time monitoring of critical parameters is essential for energy systems' safe and efficient operation. However, traditional sensors often fail and degrade in harsh environments where physical sensors cannot be placed (inaccessible locations). In addition, there are important parameters that cannot be directly measured by sensors. We need machine learning (ML)-based real-time monitoring in those remote locations to ensure system operations. However, traditional ML models struggle to process continuous sensor profile data to fit model requirements, leading to the loss of spatial relationships. Another challenge for real-time monitoring is ``dataset shift" and the need for frequent retraining under varying conditions, where extensive retraining prohibits real-time inference. To resolve these challenges, this study addressed the limitations of real-time monitoring methods by enabling monitoring in locations where physical sensors are impractical to deploy. Our proposed approach, utilizing Multi-Input Operator Network virtual sensors, leverages deep learning to seamlessly integrate diverse data sources and accurately predict key parameters in real-time without the need for additional physical sensors. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through thermal-hydraulic monitoring in a nuclear reactor subchannel, achieving remarkable accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00108">Act Now: A Novel Online Forecasting Framework for Large-Scale Streaming Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daojun Liang, Haixia Zhang, Jing Wang, Dongfeng Yuan, Minggao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we find that existing online forecasting methods have the following issues: 1) They do not consider the update frequency of streaming data and directly use labels (future signals) to update the model, leading to information leakage. 2) Eliminating information leakage can exacerbate concept drift and online parameter updates can damage prediction accuracy. 3) Leaving out a validation set cuts off the model's continued learning. 4) Existing GPU devices cannot support online learning of large-scale streaming data. To address the above issues, we propose a novel online learning framework, Act-Now, to improve the online prediction on large-scale streaming data. Firstly, we introduce a Random Subgraph Sampling (RSS) algorithm designed to enable efficient model training. Then, we design a Fast Stream Buffer (FSB) and a Slow Stream Buffer (SSB) to update the model online. FSB updates the model immediately with the consistent pseudo- and partial labels to avoid information leakage. SSB updates the model in parallel using complete labels from earlier times. Further, to address concept drift, we propose a Label Decomposition model (Lade) with statistical and normalization flows. Lade forecasts both the statistical variations and the normalized future values of the data, integrating them through a combiner to produce the final predictions. Finally, we propose to perform online updates on the validation set to ensure the consistency of model learning on streaming data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Act-Now framework performs well on large-scale streaming data, with an average 28.4% and 19.5% performance improvement, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Shi, Yixin Tao, Shih-Chi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of B-cell epitopes is critical for guiding vaccine development against infectious diseases, including SARS and COVID-19. This study explores the use of a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict B-cell epitopes for SARS-CoVandSARS-CoV-2,leveraging a dataset that incorporates essential protein and peptide features. Traditional sequence-based methods often struggle with large, complex datasets, but deep learning offers promising improvements in predictive accuracy. Our model employs regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping, to enhance generalization, while also analyzing key features, including isoelectric point and aromaticity, that influence epitope recognition. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 82% in predicting COVID-19 negative and positive cases, with room for improvement in detecting positive samples. This research demonstrates the applicability of deep learning in epitope mapping, suggesting that such approaches can enhance the speed and precision of vaccine design for emerging pathogens. Future work could incorporate structural data and diverse viral strains to further refine prediction capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kart-Leong Lim, Rahul Dutta, Mihai Rotaru</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional electrostatic simulation are meshed-based methods which convert partial differential equations into an algebraic system of equations and their solutions are approximated through numerical methods. These methods are time consuming and any changes in their initial or boundary conditions will require solving the numerical problem again. Newer computational methods such as the physics informed neural net (PINN) similarly require re-training when boundary conditions changes. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach to model parameter changes to the boundary conditions. The proposed method is demonstrated on the test problem of a long air-filled capacitor structure. The proposed approach is compared to plain vanilla deep learning (NN) and PINN. It is shown that our method can significantly outperform both NN and PINN under dynamic boundary condition as well as retaining its full capability as a forward model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Colombo, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) hold the potential for significantly reducing computational complexity and memory demand in machine and deep learning. However, most successful training algorithms for BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with full-precision hidden weights used during training. The binarized weights are only used at inference time, hindering the full exploitation of binary operations during the training process. In contrast to the existing literature, we introduce, for the first time, a multi-layer training algorithm for BNNs that does not require the computation of back-propagated full-precision gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is based on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity mechanism, thereby establishing it as a neurobiologically plausible algorithm. The binary-native and gradient-free algorithm proposed in this paper is capable of training binary multi-layer perceptrons (BMLPs) with binary inputs, weights, and activations, by using exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations, hence effectively paving the way for a new class of operation-optimized training algorithms. Experimental results on BMLPs fully trained in a binary-native and gradient-free manner on multi-class image classification benchmarks demonstrate an accuracy improvement of up to +13.36% compared to the fully binary state-of-the-art solution, showing minimal accuracy degradation compared to the same architecture trained with full-precision SGD and floating-point weights, activations, and inputs. The proposed algorithm is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Das, Stephan Schl\"uter, Lorenz Schneider</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid model for predicting German electricity prices. The algorithm is based on combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). While GPR is a competent model for learning the stochastic pattern within the data and interpolation, its performance for out-of-sample data is not very promising. By choosing a suitable data-dependent covariance function, we can enhance the performance of GPR for the tested German hourly power prices. However, since the out-of-sample prediction depends on the training data, the prediction is vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome this issue, a separate prediction is made using SVR, which applies margin-based optimization, having an advantage in dealing with non-linear processes and outliers, since only certain necessary points (support vectors) in the training data are responsible for regression. Both individual predictions are later combined using the performance-based weight assignment method. A test on historic German power prices shows that this approach outperforms its chosen benchmarks such as the autoregressive exogenous model, the naive approach, as well as the long short-term memory approach of prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhou, Youwen Zhu, Qiao Xue, Ji Zhang, Pengfei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the enactment of "right to be forgotten" laws and regulations has imposed new privacy requirements on federated learning (FL). Researchers aim to remove the influence of certain data from the trained model without training from scratch through federated unlearning (FU). While current FU research has shown progress in enhancing unlearning efficiency, it often results in degraded model performance upon achieving the goal of data unlearning, necessitating additional steps to recover the performance of the unlearned model. Moreover, these approaches also suffer from many shortcomings such as high consumption of computational and storage resources. To this end, we propose a streamlined federated unlearning approach (SFU) aimed at effectively removing the influence of target data while preserving the model's performance on the retained data without degradation. We design a practical multi-teacher system that achieves both target data influence removal and model performance preservation by guiding the unlearned model through several distinct teacher models. SFU is both computationally and storage-efficient, highly flexible, and generalizable. We conducted extensive experiments on both image and text benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that SFU significantly improves time and communication efficiency compared to the benchmark retraining method and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Additionally, we verified the effectiveness of SFU using the backdoor attack.</p>

<p>Abstract: For decades, researchers have developed task-specific models to address scientific challenges across diverse disciplines. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown enormous capabilities in handling general tasks; however, these models encounter difficulties in addressing real-world scientific problems, particularly in domains involving large-scale numerical data analysis, such as experimental high energy physics. This limitation is primarily due to BPE tokenization's inefficacy with numerical data. In this paper, we propose a task-agnostic architecture, BBT-Neutron, which employs a binary tokenization method to facilitate pretraining on a mixture of textual and large-scale numerical experimental data. The project code is available at https://github.com/supersymmetry-technologies/bbt-neutron. We demonstrate the application of BBT-Neutron to Jet Origin Identification (JoI), a critical categorization challenge in high-energy physics that distinguishes jets originating from various quarks or gluons. Our results indicate that BBT-Neutron achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific JoI models. Furthermore, we examine the scaling behavior of BBT-Neutron's performance with increasing data volume, suggesting the potential for BBT-Neutron to serve as a foundational model for particle physics data analysis, with possible extensions to a broad spectrum of scientific computing applications for Big Science experiments, industrial manufacturing and spacial computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennart K\"opper, Thomas Wieland</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world traffic involves diverse road users, ranging from pedestrians to heavy trucks, necessitating effective road user classification for various applications within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Traditional approaches often rely on intrusive and/or expensive external hardware sensors. These systems typically have limited spatial coverage. In response to these limitations, this work aims to investigate an unintrusive and cost-effective alternative for road user classification by using high-frequency (1-2 Hz) positional sequences. A cutting-edge solution could involve leveraging positioning data from 5G networks. However, this feature is currently only proposed in the 3GPP standard and has not yet been implemented for outdoor applications by 5G equipment vendors. Therefore, our approach relies on positional data, that is recorded under real-world conditions using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and processed on distributed edge devices. As a start-ing point, four types of road users are distinguished: pedestri-ans, cyclists, motorcycles, and passenger cars. While earlier approaches used classical statistical methods, we propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the preferred classification method, as they repre-sent state-of-the-art in processing sequential data. An RNN architecture for road user classification, based on selected motion characteristics derived from raw positional sequences is presented and the influence of sequence length on classifica-tion quality is examined. The results of the work show that RNNs are capable of efficiently classifying road users on dis-tributed devices, and can particularly differentiate between types of motorized vehicles, based on two- to four-minute se-quences.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00143">Is Oracle Pruning the True Oracle?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sicheng Feng, Keda Tao, Huan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Oracle pruning, which selects unimportant weights by minimizing the pruned train loss, has been taken as the foundation for most neural network pruning methods for over 35 years, while few (if not none) have thought about how much the foundation really holds. This paper, for the first time, attempts to examine its validity on modern deep models through empirical correlation analyses and provide reflections on the field of neural network pruning. Specifically, for a typical pruning algorithm with three stages (pertaining, pruning, and retraining), we analyze the model performance correlation before and after retraining. Extensive experiments (37K models are trained) across a wide spectrum of models (LeNet5, VGG, ResNets, ViT, MLLM) and datasets (MNIST and its variants, CIFAR10/CIFAR100, ImageNet-1K, MLLM data) are conducted. The results lead to a surprising conclusion: on modern deep learning models, the performance before retraining is barely correlated with the performance after retraining. Namely, the weights selected by oracle pruning can hardly guarantee a good performance after retraining. This further implies that existing works using oracle pruning to derive pruning criteria may be groundless from the beginning. Further studies suggest the rising task complexity is one factor that makes oracle pruning invalid nowadays. Finally, given the evidence, we argue that the retraining stage in a pruning algorithm should be accounted for when developing any pruning criterion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengbang Zou, Weisi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling the evolution of system with time-series data is a challenging and critical task in a wide range of fields, especially when the time-series data is regularly sampled and partially observable. Some methods have been proposed to estimate the hidden dynamics between intervals like Neural ODE or Exponential decay dynamic function and combine with RNN to estimate the evolution. However, it is difficult for these methods to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies existing within graph-structured time-series data and take full advantage of the available relational information to impute missing data and predict the future states. Besides, traditional RNN-based methods leverage shared RNN cell to update the hidden state which does not capture the impact of various intervals and missing state information on the reliability of estimating the hidden state. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a method embedding Graph Neural ODE with reliability and time-aware mechanism which can capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in irregularly sampled and partially observable time-series data to reconstruct the dynamics. Also, a loss function is designed considering the reliability of the augment data from the above proposed method to make further prediction. The proposed method has been validated in experiments of different networked dynamical systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, origin-destination (OD) demand prediction has gained significant attention for its profound implications in urban development. Existing data-driven deep learning methods primarily focus on the spatial or temporal dependency between regions yet neglecting regions' fundamental functional difference. Though knowledge-driven physical methods have characterised regions' functions by their radiation and attraction capacities, these functions are defined on numerical factors like population without considering regions' intrinsic nominal attributes, e.g., a region is a residential or industrial district. Moreover, the complicated relationships between two types of capacities, e.g., the radiation capacity of a residential district in the morning will be transformed into the attraction capacity in the evening, are totally missing from physical methods.
  In this paper, we not only generalize the physical radiation and attraction capacities into the deep learning framework with the extended capability to fulfil regions' functions, but also present a new model that captures the relationships between two types of capacities. Specifically, we first model regions' radiation and attraction capacities using a bilateral branch network, each equipped with regions' attribute representations. We then describe the transformation relationship of different capacities of the same region using a hypergraph-based parameter generation method. We finally unveil the competition relationship of different regions with the same attraction capacity through cluster-based adversarial learning. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the consistent improvements of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, as well as the good explainability of regions' functions using their nominal attributes.</p>

We show that MIRO supports simultaneous processing of clusters of different shapes and at multiple scales, demonstrating improved performance across varied datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MIRO's transformative potential for single-molecule localization applications, showcasing its capability to revolutionize cluster analysis and provide accurate, reliable details of molecular architecture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zong-En Chen, Cheng-Wei Chiang, Feng-Yang Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Weak supervision combines the advantages of training on real data with the ability to exploit signal properties. However, training a neural network using weak supervision often requires an excessive amount of signal data, which severely limits its practical applicability. In this study, we propose addressing this limitation through data augmentation, increasing the training data's size and diversity. Specifically, we focus on physics-inspired data augmentation methods, such as $p_{\text{T}}$ smearing and jet rotation. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of weak supervision, enabling neural networks to learn efficiently from substantially less data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> H. \c{C}a\u{g}r{\i} Bilgi, Lydia Y. Chen, Kubilay Atasu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have seen significant advances in recent years, yet their application to multigraphs, where parallel edges exist between the same pair of nodes, remains under-explored. Standard GNNs, designed for simple graphs, compute node representations by combining all connected edges at once, without distinguishing between edges from different neighbors. There are some GNN architectures proposed specifically for multigraph tasks, yet these architectures perform only node-level aggregation in their message-passing layers, which limits their expressive power. Furthermore, these approaches either lack permutation equivariance when a strict total edge ordering is absent, or fail to preserve the topological structure of the multigraph. To address all these shortcomings, we propose MEGA-GNN, a unified framework for message passing on multigraphs that can effectively perform diverse graph learning tasks. Our approach introduces a two-stage aggregation process in the message passing layers: first, parallel edges are aggregated, followed by a node-level aggregation that operates on aggregated messages from distinct neighbors. We show that MEGA-GNN supports permutation equivariance and invariance properties. We also show that MEGA-GNN is universal given a strict total order on the edges. Experiments on synthetic and real-world financial transaction datasets demonstrate that MEGA-GNN either significantly outperforms or is on par with the accuracy of state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gordon Lim, Stefan Larson, Kevin Leach</p>
<p>Abstract: In deep learning (DL) systems, label noise in training datasets often degrades model performance, as models may learn incorrect patterns from mislabeled data. The area of Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) has introduced methods to effectively train DL models in the presence of noisily-labeled datasets. Traditionally, these methods are tested using synthetic label noise, where ground truth labels are randomly (and automatically) flipped. However, recent findings highlight that models perform substantially worse under human label noise than synthetic label noise, indicating a need for more realistic test scenarios that reflect noise introduced due to imperfect human labeling. This underscores the need for generating realistic noisy labels that simulate human label noise, enabling rigorous testing of deep neural networks without the need to collect new human-labeled datasets. To address this gap, we present Cluster-Based Noise (CBN), a method for generating feature-dependent noise that simulates human-like label noise. Using insights from our case study of label memorization in the CIFAR-10N dataset, we design CBN to create more realistic tests for evaluating LNL methods. Our experiments demonstrate that current LNL methods perform worse when tested using CBN, highlighting its use as a rigorous approach to testing neural networks. Next, we propose Soft Neighbor Label Sampling (SNLS), a method designed to handle CBN, demonstrating its improvement over existing techniques in tackling this more challenging type of noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jo\~ao Mattos, Zexi Huang, Mert Kosan, Ambuj Singh, Arlei Silva</p>
<p>Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental problem in graph data. In its most realistic setting, the problem consists of predicting missing or future links between random pairs of nodes from the set of disconnected pairs. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the predominant framework for link prediction. GNN-based methods treat link prediction as a binary classification problem and handle the extreme class imbalance -- real graphs are very sparse -- by sampling (uniformly at random) a balanced number of disconnected pairs not only for training but also for evaluation. However, we show that the reported performance of GNNs for link prediction in the balanced setting does not translate to the more realistic imbalanced setting and that simpler topology-based approaches are often better at handling sparsity. These findings motivate Gelato, a similarity-based link-prediction method that applies (1) graph learning based on node attributes to enhance a topological heuristic, (2) a ranking loss for addressing class imbalance, and (3) a negative sampling scheme that efficiently selects hard training pairs via graph partitioning. Experiments show that Gelato outperforms existing GNN-based alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Sun, Sander Boht\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a standard tool to quantify the reliability of modern deep learning models, and crucial for many real-world applications. However, efficient uncertainty estimation methods for spiking neural networks, particularly for regression models, have been lacking. Here, we introduce two methods that adapt the Average-Over-Time Spiking Neural Network (AOT-SNN) framework to regression tasks, enhancing uncertainty estimation in event-driven models. The first method uses the heteroscedastic Gaussian approach, where SNNs predict both the mean and variance at each time step, thereby generating a conditional probability distribution of the target variable. The second method leverages the Regression-as-Classification (RAC) approach, reformulating regression as a classification problem to facilitate uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our approaches on both a toy dataset and several benchmark datasets, demonstrating that the proposed AOT-SNN models achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art deep neural network methods, particularly in uncertainty estimation. Our findings highlight the potential of SNNs for uncertainty estimation in regression tasks, providing an efficient and biologically inspired alternative for applications requiring both accuracy and energy efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Hosseini, Duohan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Two-sided matching markets have demonstrated significant impact in many real-world applications, including school choice, medical residency placement, electric vehicle charging, ride sharing, and recommender systems. However, traditional models often assume that preferences are known, which is not always the case in modern markets, where preferences are unknown and must be learned. For example, a company may not know its preference over all job applicants a priori in online markets. Recent research has modeled matching markets as multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and primarily focused on optimizing matching for one side of the market, while often resulting in a pessimal solution for the other side. In this paper, we adopt a welfarist approach for both sides of the market, focusing on two metrics: (1) Utilitarian welfare and (2) Rawlsian welfare, while maintaining market stability. For these metrics, we propose algorithms based on epoch Explore-Then-Commit (ETC) and analyze their regret bounds. Finally, we conduct simulated experiments to evaluate both welfare and market stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karine Karine, Susan A. Murphy, Benjamin M. Marlin</p>
<p>Abstract: In settings where the application of reinforcement learning (RL) requires running real-world trials, including the optimization of adaptive health interventions, the number of episodes available for learning can be severely limited due to cost or time constraints. In this setting, the bias-variance trade-off of contextual bandit methods can be significantly better than that of more complex full RL methods. However, Thompson sampling bandits are limited to selecting actions based on distributions of immediate rewards. In this paper, we extend the linear Thompson sampling bandit to select actions based on a state-action utility function consisting of the Thompson sampler's estimate of the expected immediate reward combined with an action bias term. We use batch Bayesian optimization over episodes to learn the action bias terms with the goal of maximizing the expected return of the extended Thompson sampler. The proposed approach is able to learn optimal policies for a strictly broader class of Markov decision processes (MDPs) than standard Thompson sampling. Using an adaptive intervention simulation environment that captures key aspects of behavioral dynamics, we show that the proposed method can significantly out-perform standard Thompson sampling in terms of total return, while requiring significantly fewer episodes than standard value function and policy gradient methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhe Liu, Haitao Mao, Zhikai Chen, Wenqi Fan, Mingxuan Ju, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to capture intricate network patterns, achieving success across different domains. However, existing GNNs require careful domain-specific architecture designs and training from scratch on each dataset, leading to an expertise-intensive process with difficulty in generalizing across graphs from different domains. Therefore, it can be hard for practitioners to infer which GNN model can generalize well to graphs from their domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-domain pretraining framework, "one model for one graph," which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches that failed to use a single GNN to capture diverse graph patterns across domains with significant gaps. Specifically, we pretrain a bank of expert models, with each one corresponding to a specific dataset. When inferring to a new graph, gating functions choose a subset of experts to effectively integrate prior model knowledge while avoiding negative transfer. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on both link prediction and node classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaohan Yu, Pan Deng, Yu Zhao, Junting Liu, Zi'ang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial-temporal forecasting has various applications in transportation, climate, and human activity domains. Current spatial-temporal forecasting models primarily adopt a macro perspective, focusing on achieving strong overall prediction performance for the entire system. However, most of these models overlook the importance of enhancing the uniformity of prediction performance across different nodes, leading to poor prediction capabilities for certain nodes and rendering some results impractical. This task is particularly challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity of spatial-temporal data. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) for fair spatial-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we design a Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN), integrated into each expert model to enhance the flexibility of the experts. To adapt to the heterogeneity of spatial-temporal data, we design a Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE). This model decouples the spatial-temporal prediction task into sub-tasks at the spatial scale, which are then assigned to different experts. To allocate these sub-tasks, we use a mean-based graph decoupling method to distinguish the graph structure for each expert. The results are then aggregated using an output gating mechanism based on a dense Mixture-of-Experts (dMoE). Additionally, fairness-aware loss and evaluation functions are proposed to train the model with uniformity and accuracy as objectives. Experiments conducted on four datasets, encompassing diverse data types and spatial scopes, validate HiMoE's ability to scale across various real-world scenarios. Furthermore, HiMoE consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving superior performance in both accuracy and uniformity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geethan Karunaratne, Michael Hersche, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi</p>
<p>Abstract: To efficiently factorize high-dimensional distributed representations to the constituent atomic vectors, one can exploit the compute-in-superposition capabilities of vector-symbolic architectures (VSA). Such factorizers however suffer from the phenomenon of limit cycles.
  Applying noise during the iterative decoding is one mechanism to address this issue. In this paper, we explore ways to further relax the noise requirement by applying noise only at the time of VSA's reconstruction codebook initialization. While the need for noise during iterations proves analog in-memory computing systems to be a natural choice as an implementation media, the adequacy of initialization noise allows digital hardware to remain equally indispensable. This broadens the implementation possibilities of factorizers. Our study finds that while the best performance shifts from initialization noise to iterative noise as the number of factors increases from 2 to 4, both extend the operational capacity by at least 50 times compared to the baseline factorizer resonator networks.

<p>Abstract: We present an optimal method for encoding cluster assignments of arbitrary data sets. Our method, Random Cycle Coding (RCC), encodes data sequentially and sends assignment information as cycles of the permutation defined by the order of encoded elements. RCC does not require any training and its worst-case complexity scales quasi-linearly with the size of the largest cluster. We characterize the achievable bit rates as a function of cluster sizes and number of elements, showing RCC consistently outperforms previous methods while requiring less compute and memory resources. Experiments show RCC can save up to 2 bytes per element when applied to vector databases, and removes the need for assigning integer ids to identify vectors, translating to savings of up to 70% in vector database systems for similarity search applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00373">Approximate Fiber Product: A Preliminary Algebraic-Geometric Perspective on Multimodal Embedding Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongfang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal tasks, such as image-text retrieval and generation, require embedding data from diverse modalities into a shared representation space. Aligning embeddings from heterogeneous sources while preserving shared and modality-specific information is a fundamental challenge. This paper provides an initial attempt to integrate algebraic geometry into multimodal representation learning, offering a foundational perspective for further exploration.
  We model image and text data as polynomials over discrete rings, \( \mathbb{Z}_{256}[x] \) and \( \mathbb{Z}_{|V|}[x] \), respectively, enabling the use of algebraic tools like fiber products to analyze alignment properties. To accommodate real-world variability, we extend the classical fiber product to an approximate fiber product with a tolerance parameter \( \epsilon \), balancing precision and noise tolerance. We study its dependence on \( \epsilon \), revealing asymptotic behavior, robustness to perturbations, and sensitivity to embedding dimensionality.
  Additionally, we propose a decomposition of the shared embedding space into orthogonal subspaces, \( Z = Z_s \oplus Z_I \oplus Z_T \), where \( Z_s \) captures shared semantics, and \( Z_I \), \( Z_T \) encode modality-specific features. This decomposition is geometrically interpreted via manifolds and fiber bundles, offering insights into embedding structure and optimization.
  This framework establishes a principled foundation for analyzing multimodal alignment, uncovering connections between robustness, dimensionality allocation, and algebraic structure. It lays the groundwork for further research on embedding spaces in multimodal learning using algebraic geometry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyu Li, Debo Cheng, Guixian Zhang, Yi Li, Shichao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph representation learning across various real-world applications. However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</p>

Our pretrained model generalizes for prediction tasks across different dynamical systems, which we validate in simulation and hardware experiments, including cart-pole and Furuta pendulum setups. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned effectively to new systems to increase performance even further. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of foundation models for dynamical systems that outperform specialist models in terms of generalization, data efficiency, and robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing datasets representative of the target domain is essential for training effective machine learning models. Active learning (AL) is a promising method that iteratively extends training data to enhance model performance while minimizing data acquisition costs. However, current AL workflows often require human intervention and lack parallelism, leading to inefficiencies and underutilization of modern computational resources. In this work, we introduce PAL, an automated, modular, and parallel active learning library that integrates AL tasks and manages their execution and communication on shared- and distributed-memory systems using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). PAL provides users with the flexibility to design and customize all components of their active learning scenarios, including machine learning models with uncertainty estimation, oracles for ground truth labeling, and strategies for exploring the target space. We demonstrate that PAL significantly reduces computational overhead and improves scalability, achieving substantial speed-ups through asynchronous parallelization on CPU and GPU hardware. Applications of PAL to several real-world scenarios - including ground-state reactions in biomolecular systems, excited-state dynamics of molecules, simulations of inorganic clusters, and thermo-fluid dynamics - illustrate its effectiveness in accelerating the development of machine learning models. Our results show that PAL enables efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources in active learning workflows, fostering advancements in scientific research and engineering applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable achievements of large models in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have sparked interest in their application to time series forecasting within industrial contexts. This paper explores the application of a pre-trained large time series model, Timer, which was initially trained on a wide range of time series data from multiple domains, in the prediction of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data collected from wind turbines. The model was fine-tuned on SCADA datasets sourced from two wind farms, which exhibited differing characteristics, and its accuracy was subsequently evaluated. Additionally, the impact of data volume was studied to evaluate the few-shot ability of the Timer. Finally, an application study on one-turbine fine-tuning for whole-plant prediction was implemented where both few-shot and cross-turbine generalization capacity is required. The results reveal that the pre-trained large model does not consistently outperform other baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy whenever the data is abundant or not, but demonstrates superior performance in the application study. This result underscores the distinctive advantages of the pre-trained large time series model in facilitating swift deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: As machine learning gets deployed more and more widely, and model sizes continue to grow, improving computational efficiency during model inference has become a key challenge. In many commonly used model architectures, including Transformers, a significant portion of the inference computation is comprised of exponential non-linearities such as Softmax. In this work, we develop QuAKE, a collection of novel operators that leverage certain properties of IEEE-754 floating point representations to quickly approximate the exponential function without requiring specialized hardware, extra memory, or precomputation. We propose optimizations that enhance the efficiency of QuAKE in commonly used exponential non-linearities such as Softmax, GELU, and the Logistic function. Our benchmarks demonstrate substantial inference speed improvements between 10% and 35% on server CPUs, and 5% and 45% on embedded and mobile-scale CPUs for a variety of model architectures and sizes. Evaluations of model performance on standard datasets and tasks from various domains show that QuAKE operators are able to provide sizable speed benefits with little to no loss of performance on downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimizing smart grid operations relies on critical decision-making informed by uncertainty quantification, making probabilistic forecasting a vital tool. Designing such forecasting models involves three key challenges: accurate and unbiased uncertainty quantification, workload reduction for data scientists during the design process, and limitation of the environmental impact of model training. In order to address these challenges, we introduce AutoPQ, a novel method designed to automate and optimize probabilistic forecasting for smart grid applications. AutoPQ enhances forecast uncertainty quantification by generating quantile forecasts from an existing point forecast by using a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN). AutoPQ also automates the selection of the underlying point forecasting method and the optimization of hyperparameters, ensuring that the best model and configuration is chosen for each application. For flexible adaptation to various performance needs and available computing power, AutoPQ comes with a default and an advanced configuration, making it suitable for a wide range of smart grid applications. Additionally, AutoPQ provides transparency regarding the electricity consumption required for performance improvements. We show that AutoPQ outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting methods while effectively limiting computational effort and hence environmental impact. Additionally and in the context of sustainability, we quantify the electricity consumption required for performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lan Feng, Fan Nie, Yuejiang Liu, Alexandre Alahi</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose TAROT, a targeted data selection framework grounded in optimal transport theory. Previous targeted data selection methods primarily rely on influence-based greedy heuristics to enhance domain-specific performance. While effective on limited, unimodal data (i.e., data following a single pattern), these methods struggle as target data complexity increases. Specifically, in multimodal distributions, these heuristics fail to account for multiple inherent patterns, leading to suboptimal data selection. This work identifies two primary factors contributing to this limitation: (i) the disproportionate impact of dominant feature components in high-dimensional influence estimation, and (ii) the restrictive linear additive assumptions inherent in greedy selection strategies. To address these challenges, TAROT incorporates whitened feature distance to mitigate dominant feature bias, providing a more reliable measure of data influence. Building on this, TAROT uses whitened feature distance to quantify and minimize the optimal transport distance between the selected data and target domains. Notably, this minimization also facilitates the estimation of optimal selection ratios. We evaluate TAROT across multiple tasks, including semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction tuning. Results consistently show that TAROT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its versatility across various deep learning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Meisenbacher, Silas Aaron Selzer, Mehdi Dado, Maximilian Beichter, Tim Martin, Markus Zdrallek, Peter Bretschneider, Veit Hagenmeyer, Ralf Mikut</p>
<p>Abstract: Renewable energies and their operation are becoming increasingly vital for the stability of electrical power grids since conventional power plants are progressively being displaced, and their contribution to redispatch interventions is thereby diminishing. In order to consider renewable energies like Wind Power (WP) for such interventions as a substitute, day-ahead forecasts are necessary to communicate their availability for redispatch planning. In this context, automated and scalable forecasting models are required for the deployment to thousands of locally-distributed onshore WP turbines. Furthermore, the irregular interventions into the WP generation capabilities due to redispatch shutdowns pose challenges in the design and operation of WP forecasting models. Since state-of-the-art forecasting methods consider past WP generation values alongside day-ahead weather forecasts, redispatch shutdowns may impact the forecast. Therefore, the present paper highlights these challenges and analyzes state-of-the-art forecasting methods on data sets with both regular and irregular shutdowns. Specifically, we compare the forecasting accuracy of three autoregressive Deep Learning (DL) methods to methods based on WP curve modeling. Interestingly, the latter achieve lower forecasting errors, have fewer requirements for data cleaning during modeling and operation while being computationally more efficient, suggesting their advantages in practical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Tian, Mouxing Yang, Yuhao Zhou, Jian Wang, Qing Ye, Tongliang Liu, Gang Niu, Jiancheng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of most federated learning (FL) methods heavily depends on label quality, which is often inaccessible in real-world scenarios, such as medicine, leading to the federated label-noise (F-LN) problem. In this study, we observe that the global model of FL memorizes the noisy labels slowly. Based on the observations, we propose a novel approach dubbed Global Reviser for Federated Learning with Noisy Labels (FedGR) to enhance the label-noise robustness of FL. In brief, FedGR employs three novel modules to achieve noisy label sniffing and refining, local knowledge revising, and local model regularization. Specifically, the global model is adopted to infer local data proxies for global sample selection and refine incorrect labels. To maximize the utilization of local knowledge, we leverage the global model to revise the local exponential moving average (EMA) model of each client and distill it into the clients' models. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local representation regularization to mitigate the overfitting of noisy labels. Extensive experiments on three F-LNL benchmarks against seven baseline methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedGR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Pedroza</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a mathematical approach that (re)defines a property of Machine Learning models named stability and determines sufficient conditions to validate it. Machine Learning models are represented as functions, and the characteristics in scope depend upon the domain of the function, what allows us to adopt topological and metric spaces theory as a basis. Finally, this work provides some equivalences useful to prove and test stability in Machine Learning models. The results suggest that whenever stability is aligned with the notion of function smoothness, then the stability of Machine Learning models primarily depends upon certain topological, measurable properties of the classification sets within the ML model domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Liu, Haipeng Li, Guangyuan Zou, Junlun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is able to construct high-resolution subsurface models by iteratively minimizing discrepancies between observed and simulated seismic data. However, its implementation can be rather involved for complex wave equations, objective functions, or regularization. Recently, automatic differentiation (AD) has proven to be effective in simplifying solutions of various inverse problems, including FWI. In this study, we present an open-source AD-based FWI framework (ADFWI), which is designed to simplify the design, development, and evaluation of novel approaches in FWI with flexibility. The AD-based framework not only includes forword modeling and associated gradient computations for wave equations in various types of media from isotropic acoustic to vertically or horizontally transverse isotropic elastic, but also incorporates a suite of objective functions, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms. By leveraging state-of-the-art AD, objective functions such as soft dynamic time warping and Wasserstein distance, which are difficult to apply in traditional FWI are also easily integrated into ADFWI. In addition, ADFWI is integrated with deep learning for implicit model reparameterization via neural networks, which not only introduces learned regularization but also allows rapid estimation of uncertainty through dropout. To manage high memory demands in large-scale inversion associated with AD, the proposed framework adopts strategies such as mini-batch and checkpointing. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the novelty, practicality and robustness of ADFWI, which can be used to address challenges in FWI and as a workbench for prompt experiments and the development of new inversion strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonid Kotyuzanskiy, Artem Klimov</p>
<p>Abstract: The transformer architecture has become an integral part of the field of modern neural networks, playing a crucial role in a variety of tasks, such as text generation, machine translation, image and audio processing, among others. There is also an alternative approach to building intelligent systems, proposed by Jeff Hawkins and inspired by the processes occurring in the neocortex. In our article we want to combine some of these ideas and to propose the use of homeostazis mechanisms, such as RFB-kWTA and "Smart" Inhibition, in the attention mechanism of the transformer and at the output of the transformer block, as well as conducting an experiment involving the introduction of sparse distributed representations of the transformer at various points. RFB-kWTA utilizes statistics of layer activations across time to adjust the entire layer, enhancing the values of rare activations while reducing those of frequent ones. "Smart" Inhibition also uses activation statistics to sample sparsity masks, with rarer activation times are more likely to be activated. Our proposed mechanisms significantly outperform the classical transformer 0.2768 BLEU and a model that only makes use of dropout in the attention mechanism and output of the transformer block 0.3007 BLEU, achieving a score of 0.3062 on the Multi30K dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Schulze Balhorn, Kevin Degens, Artur M. Schweidtmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Control structure design is an important but tedious step in P&ID development. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce P&ID development time by supporting engineers. Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Ferrini, Antonio Longa, Andrea Passerini, Manfred Jaeger</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, significant attention has been given to the idea of viewing relational databases as heterogeneous graphs, enabling the application of graph neural network (GNN) technology for predictive tasks. However, existing GNN methods struggle with the complexity of the heterogeneous graphs induced by databases with numerous tables and relations. Traditional approaches either consider all possible relational meta-paths, thus failing to scale with the number of relations, or rely on domain experts to identify relevant meta-paths. A recent solution does manage to learn informative meta-paths without expert supervision, but assumes that a node's class depends solely on the existence of a meta-path occurrence. In this work, we present a self-explainable heterogeneous GNN for relational data, that supports models in which class membership depends on aggregate information obtained from multiple occurrences of a meta-path. Experimental results show that in the context of relational databases, our approach effectively identifies informative meta-paths that faithfully capture the model's reasoning mechanisms. It significantly outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Shi, Huaxin Pei, Liang Feng, Yi Zhang, Danya Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Agent faults pose a significant threat to the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, introducing two key challenges. First, agents often struggle to extract critical information from the chaotic state space created by unexpected faults. Second, transitions recorded before and after faults in the replay buffer affect training unevenly, leading to a sample imbalance problem. To overcome these challenges, this paper enhances the fault tolerance of MARL by combining optimized model architecture with a tailored training data sampling strategy. Specifically, an attention mechanism is incorporated into the actor and critic networks to automatically detect faults and dynamically regulate the attention given to faulty agents. Additionally, a prioritization mechanism is introduced to selectively sample transitions critical to current training needs. To further support research in this area, we design and open-source a highly decoupled code platform for fault-tolerant MARL, aimed at improving the efficiency of studying related problems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in handling various types of faults, faults occurring in any agent, and faults arising at random times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahalakshmi Sabanayagam, Lukas Gosch, Stephan G\"unnemann, Debarghya Ghoshdastidar</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models are highly vulnerable to label flipping, i.e., the adversarial modification (poisoning) of training labels to compromise performance. Thus, deriving robustness certificates is important to guarantee that test predictions remain unaffected and to understand worst-case robustness behavior. However, for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the problem of certifying label flipping has so far been unsolved. We change this by introducing an exact certification method, deriving both sample-wise and collective certificates. Our method leverages the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to capture the training dynamics of wide networks enabling us to reformulate the bilevel optimization problem representing label flipping into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). We apply our method to certify a broad range of GNN architectures in node classification tasks. Thereby, concerning the worst-case robustness to label flipping: $(i)$ we establish hierarchies of GNNs on different benchmark graphs; $(ii)$ quantify the effect of architectural choices such as activations, depth and skip-connections; and surprisingly, $(iii)$ uncover a novel phenomenon of the robustness plateauing for intermediate perturbation budgets across all investigated datasets and architectures. While we focus on GNNs, our certificates are applicable to sufficiently wide NNs in general through their NTK. Thus, our work presents the first exact certificate to a poisoning attack ever derived for neural networks, which could be of independent interest.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00546">Rank It, Then Ask It: Input Reranking for Maximizing the Performance of LLMs on Symmetric Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohsen Dehghankar, Abolfazl Asudeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have quickly emerged as practical and versatile tools that provide new solutions for a wide range of domains. In this paper, we consider the application of LLMs on symmetric tasks where a query is asked on an (unordered) bag of elements. Examples of such tasks include answering aggregate queries on a database table. In general, when the bag contains a large number of elements, LLMs tend to overlook some elements, leading to challenges in generating accurate responses to the query. LLMs receive their inputs as ordered sequences. However, in this problem, we leverage the fact that the symmetric input is not ordered, and reordering should not affect the LLM's response.
  Observing that LLMs are less likely to miss elements at certain positions of the input, we introduce the problem of LLM input reranking: to find a ranking of the input that maximizes the LLM's accuracy for the given query without making explicit assumptions about the query. Finding the optimal ranking requires identifying (i) the relevance of each input element for answering the query and (ii) the importance of each rank position for the LLM's attention. We develop algorithms for estimating these values efficiently utilizing a helper LLM. We conduct comprehensive experiments on different synthetic and real datasets to validate our proposal and to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Our experiments confirm that our reranking approach improves the accuracy of the LLMs on symmetric tasks by up to $99\%$ proximity to the optimum upper bound.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00560">Friend or Foe? Harnessing Controllable Overfitting for Anomaly Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Qian, Bingke Zhu, Yingying Chen, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Overfitting has long been stigmatized as detrimental to model performance, especially in the context of anomaly detection. Our work challenges this conventional view by introducing a paradigm shift, recasting overfitting as a controllable and strategic mechanism for enhancing model discrimination capabilities. In this paper, we present Controllable Overfitting-based Anomaly Detection (COAD), a novel framework designed to leverage overfitting for optimized anomaly detection. We propose the Aberrance Retention Quotient (ARQ), a novel metric that systematically quantifies the extent of overfitting, enabling the identification of an optimal "golden overfitting interval." Within this interval, overfitting is leveraged to significantly amplify the model's sensitivity to anomalous patterns, while preserving generalization to normal samples. Additionally, we present the Relative Anomaly Distribution Index (RADI), an innovative metric designed to complement AUROC pixel by providing a more versatile and theoretically robust framework for assessing model performance. RADI leverages ARQ to track and evaluate how overfitting impacts anomaly detection, offering an integrated approach to understanding the relationship between overfitting dynamics and model efficacy. Our theoretical work also rigorously validates the use of Gaussian noise in pseudo anomaly synthesis, providing the foundation for its broader applicability across diverse domains. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our controllable overfitting method not only achieves State of the Art (SOTA) performance in both one-class and multi-class anomaly detection tasks but also redefines overfitting from a modeling challenge into a powerful tool for optimizing anomaly detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning based surrogate models offer researchers powerful tools for accelerating simulation-based workflows. However, as standard datasets in this space often cover small classes of physical behavior, it can be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the Well: a large-scale collection of datasets containing numerical simulations of a wide variety of spatiotemporal physical systems. The Well draws from domain experts and numerical software developers to provide 15TB of data across 16 datasets covering diverse domains such as biological systems, fluid dynamics, acoustic scattering, as well as magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of extra-galactic fluids or supernova explosions. These datasets can be used individually or as part of a broader benchmark suite. To facilitate usage of the Well, we provide a unified PyTorch interface for training and evaluating models. We demonstrate the function of this library by introducing example baselines that highlight the new challenges posed by the complex dynamics of the Well.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akhila Vangara, Alex Egg</p>
<p>Abstract: Uniform random exploration in decision-making systems supports off-policy learning via supervision but incurs high regret, making it impractical for many applications. Conversely, non-uniform exploration offers better immediate performance but lacks support for off-policy learning. Recent research suggests that regression oracles can bridge this gap by combining non-uniform exploration with supervised learning. In this paper, we analyze these approaches within a real-world industrial context at Adyen, a large global payments processor characterized by batch logged delayed feedback, short-term memory, and dynamic action spaces under the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework. Our analysis reveals that while regression oracles significantly improve performance, they introduce challenges due to rigid algorithmic assumptions. Specifically, we observe that as a policy improves, subsequent generations may perform worse due to shifts in the reward distribution and increased class imbalance in the training data. This degradation occurs de spite improvements in other aspects of the training data, leading to decreased performance in successive policy iterations. We further explore the long-term impact of regression oracles, identifying a potential "oscillation effect." This effect arises when regression oracles influence probability estimates and the realizability of subsequent policy models, leading to fluctuations in performance across iterations. Our findings highlight the need for more adaptable algorithms that can leverage the benefits of regression oracles without introducing instability in policy performance over time.</p>

<p>Abstract: It is well known that the usefulness of a machine learning model is due to its ability to generalize to unseen data. This study uses three popular cyberbullying datasets to explore the effects of data, how it's collected, and how it's labeled, on the resulting machine learning models. The bias introduced from differing definitions of cyberbullying and from data collection is discussed in detail. An emphasis is made on the impact of dataset expansion methods, which utilize current data points to fetch and label new ones. Furthermore, explicit testing is performed to evaluate the ability of a model to generalize to unseen datasets through cross-dataset evaluation. As hypothesized, the models have a significant drop in the Macro F1 Score, with an average drop of 0.222. As such, this study effectively highlights the importance of dataset curation and cross-dataset testing for creating models with real-world applicability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xunye Tian, Liuhua Peng, Zhijian Zhou, Mingming Gong, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning effective data representations is crucial in answering if two samples X and Y are from the same distribution (a.k.a. the non-parametric two-sample testing problem), which can be categorized into: i) learning discriminative representations (DRs) that distinguish between two samples in a supervised-learning paradigm, and ii) learning inherent representations (IRs) focusing on data's inherent features in an unsupervised-learning paradigm. However, both paradigms have issues: learning DRs reduces the data points available for the two-sample testing phase, and learning purely IRs misses discriminative cues. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel perspective to consider non-parametric two-sample testing as a semi-supervised learning (SSL) problem, introducing the SSL-based Classifier Two-Sample Test (SSL-C2ST) framework. While a straightforward implementation of SSL-C2ST might directly use existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL methods to train a classifier with labeled data (with sample indexes X or Y) and unlabeled data (the remaining ones in the two samples), conventional two-sample testing data often exhibits substantial overlap between samples and violates SSL methods' assumptions, resulting in low test power. Therefore, we propose a two-step approach: first, learn IRs using all data, then fine-tune IRs with only labelled data to learn DRs, which can both utilize information from whole dataset and adapt the discriminative power to the given data. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that SSL-C2ST outperforms traditional C2ST by effectively leveraging unlabeled data. We also offer a stronger empirically designed test achieving the SOTA performance in many two-sample testing datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Wu, Huayi Zhang, Yizheng Jiao, Lin Ma, Xiaozhong Liu, Jinhong Yu, Dongyu Zhang, Dezhi Yu, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human-controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00648">DFRot: Achieving Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free for Rotated LLMs with Refined Rotation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Xiang, Saiqian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of outliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies have shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations (W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve significantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably, the reason behind this phenomena remains unknown. In this paper, we find that these transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for common tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for the accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms can slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations while randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to the extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy, we consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a simple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating optimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes transforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the rotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens with massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving dual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning the rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity improvement of 0.25 and 0.21 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for LLaMA3-8B, a model known for its quantization challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Tang, Boyuan Wang, Chuan Wen, Jiaye Teng</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely adopted in uncertainty quantification, due to its post-hoc, distribution-free, and model-agnostic properties. In the realm of modern deep learning, researchers have proposed Feature Conformal Prediction (FCP), which deploys conformal prediction in a feature space, yielding reduced band lengths. However, the practical utility of FCP is limited due to the time-consuming non-linear operations required to transform confidence bands from feature space to output space. In this paper, we introduce Fast Feature Conformal Prediction (FFCP), which features a novel non-conformity score and is convenient for practical applications. FFCP serves as a fast version of FCP, in that it equivalently employs a Taylor expansion to approximate the aforementioned non-linear operations in FCP. Empirical validations showcase that FFCP performs comparably with FCP (both outperforming the vanilla version) while achieving a significant reduction in computational time by approximately 50x.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emile Anand, Ishani Karmarkar, Guannan Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging due to the fact that the size of the joint state and action spaces are exponentially large in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm \texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ} (\textbf{Subsample}-\textbf{M}ean-\textbf{F}ield-\textbf{Q}-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$, our algorithm system learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy in the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We validate our method empirically on Gaussian squeeze and global exploration settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Qi, Shihong Yuan, Yuyin Yuan, Linling Kuang, Yoshiyuki Kabashima, Xiangming Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performances in solving inverse problems through posterior sampling while they suffer from errors during earlier steps. To mitigate this issue, several Decoupled Posterior Sampling methods have been recently proposed. However, the reverse process in these methods ignores measurement information, leading to errors that impede effective optimization in subsequent steps. To solve this problem, we propose Guided Decoupled Posterior Sampling (GDPS) by integrating a data consistency constraint in the reverse process. The constraint performs a smoother transition within the optimization process, facilitating a more effective convergence toward the target distribution. Furthermore, we extend our method to latent diffusion models and Tweedie's formula, demonstrating its scalability. We evaluate GDPS on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets across various linear and nonlinear tasks under both standard and challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that GDPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy over existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamad Haj Fares, Ahmed Mohamed Saad Emam Saad</p>
<p>Abstract: With increasing concerns over privacy in healthcare, especially for sensitive medical data, this research introduces a federated learning framework that combines local differential privacy and secure aggregation using Secure Multi-Party Computation for medical image classification. Further, we propose DPResNet, a modified ResNet architecture optimized for differential privacy. Leveraging the BloodMNIST benchmark dataset, we simulate a realistic data-sharing environment across different hospitals, addressing the distinct privacy challenges posed by federated healthcare data. Experimental results indicate that our privacy-preserving federated model achieves accuracy levels close to non-private models, surpassing traditional approaches while maintaining strict data confidentiality. By enhancing the privacy, efficiency, and reliability of healthcare data management, our approach offers substantial benefits to patients, healthcare providers, and the broader healthcare ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruifan Huang, Haixia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We bridge fairness gaps from a statistical perspective by selectively utilizing either conditional distance covariance or distance covariance statistics as measures to assess the independence between predictions and sensitive attributes. We enhance fairness by incorporating sample (conditional) distance covariance as a manageable penalty term into the machine learning process. Additionally, we present the matrix form of empirical (conditional) distance covariance for parallel calculations to enhance computational efficiency. Theoretically, we provide a proof for the convergence between empirical and population (conditional) distance covariance, establishing necessary guarantees for batch computations. Through experiments conducted on a range of real-world datasets, we have demonstrated that our method effectively bridges the fairness gap in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ke Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: This work analyses the disparity in performance between Decision Transformer (DT) and Decision Mamba (DM) in sequence modelling reinforcement learning tasks for different Atari games. The study first observed that DM generally outperformed DT in the games Breakout and Qbert, while DT performed better in more complicated games, such as Hero and Kung Fu Master. To understand these differences, we expanded the number of games to 12 and performed a comprehensive analysis of game characteristics, including action space complexity, visual complexity, average trajectory length, and average steps to the first non-zero reward. In order to further analyse the key factors that impact the disparity in performance between DT and DM, we employ various approaches, including quantifying visual complexity, random forest regression, correlation analysis, and action space simplification strategies. The results indicate that the performance gap between DT and DM is affected by the complex interaction of multiple factors, with the complexity of the action space and visual complexity (particularly evaluated by compression ratio) being the primary determining factors. DM performs well in environments with simple action and visual elements, while DT shows an advantage in games with higher action and visual complexity. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how the game characteristics affect the performance difference in sequential modelling reinforcement learning, potentially guiding the development of future model design and applications for diverse and complex environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Naman Deep Singh, Francesco Croce, Matthias Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language models like CLIP have been shown to be highly effective at linking visual perception and natural language understanding, enabling sophisticated image-text capabilities, including strong retrieval and zero-shot classification performance. Their widespread use, as well as the fact that CLIP models are trained on image-text pairs from the web, make them both a worthwhile and relatively easy target for backdoor attacks. As training foundational models, such as CLIP, from scratch is very expensive, this paper focuses on cleaning potentially poisoned models via fine-tuning. We first show that existing cleaning techniques are not effective against simple structured triggers used in Blended or BadNet backdoor attacks, exposing a critical vulnerability for potential real-world deployment of these models. Then, we introduce PAR, Perturb and Recover, a surprisingly simple yet effective mechanism to remove backdoors from CLIP models. Through extensive experiments across different encoders and types of backdoor attacks, we show that PAR achieves high backdoor removal rate while preserving good standard performance. Finally, we illustrate that our approach is effective even only with synthetic text-image pairs, i.e. without access to real training data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Miguel Lara Rangel, Stefan Schoepf, Jack Foster, David Krueger, Usman Anwar</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is gaining increasing attention as a way to remove adversarial data poisoning attacks from already trained models and to comply with privacy and AI regulations. The objective is to unlearn the effect of undesired data from a trained model while maintaining performance on the remaining data. This paper introduces HyperForget, a novel machine unlearning framework that leverages hypernetworks - neural networks that generate parameters for other networks - to dynamically sample models that lack knowledge of targeted data while preserving essential capabilities. Leveraging diffusion models, we implement two Diffusion HyperForget Networks and used them to sample unlearned models in Proof-of-Concept experiments. The unlearned models obtained zero accuracy on the forget set, while preserving good accuracy on the retain sets, highlighting the potential of HyperForget for dynamic targeted data removal and a promising direction for developing adaptive machine unlearning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangkai Ma, Xiaobin Hong, Wenzhong Li, Sanglu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series analysis is a fundamental data mining task that supervised training methods based on empirical risk minimization have proven their effectiveness on specific tasks and datasets. However, the acquisition of well-annotated data is costly and a large amount of unlabeled series data is under-utilized. Due to distributional shifts across various domains and different patterns of interest across multiple tasks. The problem of cross-domain multi-task migration of time series remains a significant challenge. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel cross-domain pretraining method based on Wave Quantization (termed as WQ4TS), which can be combined with any advanced time series model and applied to multiple downstream tasks. Specifically, we transfer the time series data from different domains into a common spectral latent space, and enable the model to learn the temporal pattern knowledge of different domains directly from the common space and utilize it for the inference of downstream tasks, thereby mitigating the challenge of heterogeneous cross-domains migration. The establishment of spectral latent space brings at least three benefits, cross-domain migration capability thus adapting to zero- and few-shot scenarios without relying on priori knowledge of the dataset, general compatible cross-domain migration framework without changing the existing model structure, and robust modeling capability thus achieving SOTA results in multiple downstream tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments including three important tasks: forecasting, imputation, and classification. And three common real-world data scenarios are simulated: full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot. The proposed WQ4TS achieves the best performance on 87.5% of all tasks, and the average improvement of the metrics on all the tasks is up to 34.7%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongyang Zhao, Dong Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to efficiently learn and accumulate knowledge from a data stream with different distributions. By formulating CL as a sequence prediction task, meta-continual learning (MCL) enables to meta-learn an efficient continual learner based on the recent advanced sequence models, e.g., Transformers. Although attention-free models (e.g., Linear Transformers) can ideally match CL's essential objective and efficiency requirements, they usually perform not well in MCL. Considering that the attention-free Mamba achieves excellent performances matching Transformers' on general sequence modeling tasks, in this paper, we aim to answer a question -- Can attention-free Mamba perform well on MCL? By formulating Mamba with a selective state space model (SSM) for MCL tasks, we propose to meta-learn Mamba as a continual learner, referred to as MambaCL. By incorporating a selectivity regularization, we can effectively train MambaCL. Through comprehensive experiments across various CL tasks, we also explore how Mamba and other models perform in different MCL scenarios. Our experiments and analyses highlight the promising performance and generalization capabilities of Mamba in MCL.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00785">Proper Latent Decomposition</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Kelshaw, Luca Magri</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the proper latent decomposition (PLD) as a generalization of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) on manifolds. PLD is a nonlinear reduced-order modeling technique for compressing high-dimensional data into nonlinear coordinates. First, we compute a reduced set of intrinsic coordinates (latent space) to accurately describe a flow with fewer degrees of freedom than the numerical discretization. The latent space, which is geometrically a manifold, is inferred by an autoencoder. Second, we leverage tools from differential geometry to develop numerical methods for operating directly on the latent space; namely, a metric-constrained Eikonal solver for distance computations. With this proposed numerical framework, we propose an algorithm to perform PLD on the manifold. Third, we demonstrate results for a laminar flow case and the turbulent Kolmogorov flow. For the laminar flow case, we are able to identify a semi-analytical expression for the solution of Navier-Stokes; in the Kolmogorov flow case, we are able to identify a dominant mode that exhibits physical structures, which are compared with POD. This work opens opportunities for analyzing autoencoders and latent spaces, nonlinear reduced-order modeling and scientific insights into the structure of high-dimensional data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Varshita Kolipaka, Akshit Sinha, Debangan Mishra, Sumit Kumar, Arvindh Arun, Shashwat Goel, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly being used for a variety of ML applications on graph data. As graph data does not follow the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption, adversarial manipulations or incorrect data can propagate to other data points through message passing, deteriorating the model's performance. To allow model developers to remove the adverse effects of manipulated entities from a trained GNN, we study the recently formulated problem of Corrective Unlearning. We find that current graph unlearning methods fail to unlearn the effect of manipulations even when the whole manipulated set is known. We introduce a new graph unlearning method, Cognac, which can unlearn the effect of the manipulation set even when only 5% of it is identified. It recovers most of the performance of a strong oracle with fully corrected training data, even beating retraining from scratch without the deletion set while being 8x more efficient. We hope our work guides GNN developers in fixing harmful effects due to issues in real-world data post-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianhui Li, Bokang Zhang, Junfeng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes an online environment poisoning algorithm tailored for reinforcement learning agents operating in a black-box setting, where an adversary deliberately manipulates training data to lead the agent toward a mischievous policy. In contrast to prior studies that primarily investigate white-box settings, we focus on a scenario characterized by \textit{unknown} environment dynamics to the attacker and a \textit{flexible} reinforcement learning algorithm employed by the targeted agent. We first propose an attack scheme that is capable of poisoning the reward functions and state transitions. The poisoning task is formalized as a constrained optimization problem, following the framework of \cite{ma2019policy}. Given the transition probabilities are unknown to the attacker in a black-box environment, we apply a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, where the exact gradients are approximated using sample-based estimates. A penalty-based method along with a bilevel reformulation is then employed to transform the problem into an unconstrained counterpart and to circumvent the double-sampling issue. The algorithm's effectiveness is validated through a maze environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seockbean Song, Youngsik Yoon, Siwei Wang, Wei Chen, Jungseul Ok</p>
<p>Abstract: Combinatorial online learning is a fundamental task to decide the optimal combination of base arms in sequential interactions with systems providing uncertain rewards, which is applicable to diverse domains such as robotics, social advertising, network routing and recommendation systems. In real-world scenarios, we often observe rising rewards, where the selection of a base arm not only provides an instantaneous reward but also contributes to the enhancement of future rewards, {\it e.g.}, robots enhancing proficiency through practice and social influence strengthening in the history of successful recommendations. To address this, we introduce the problem of combinatorial rising bandit to minimize policy regret and propose a provably efficient algorithm, called Combinatorial Rising Upper Confidence Bound (CRUCB), of which regret upper bound is close to a regret lower bound. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies do not provide a sub-linear regret lower bound, making it impossible to assess the efficiency of their algorithms. However, we provide the sub-linear regret lower bound for combinatorial rising bandit and show that CRUCB is provably efficient by showing that the regret upper bound is close to the regret lower bound. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CRUCB not only in synthetic environments but also in realistic applications of deep reinforcement learning.</p>

While traditional methods for designing new ionizable lipids are typically time-consuming, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful solution, significantly accelerating the molecular discovery process. However, a practical challenge arises as the molecular structures generated can often be difficult or infeasible to synthesize. This project explores Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based generative models for synthesizable ionizable lipids. Leveraging a synthetically accessible lipid building block dataset and two specialized predictors to guide the search through chemical space, we introduce a policy network guided MCTS generative model capable of producing new ionizable lipids with available synthesis pathways.</p>

<p>Abstract: The aim of this paper is to formalise the task of continual semi-supervised anomaly detection (CSAD), with the aim of highlighting the importance of such a problem formulation which assumes as close to real-world conditions as possible. After an overview of the relevant definitions of continual semi-supervised learning, its components, anomaly detection extension, and the training protocols; the paper introduces a baseline model of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to work with semi-supervised data along with a continual learning method of deep generative replay with outlier rejection. The results show that such a use of extreme value theory (EVT) applied to anomaly detection can provide promising results even in comparison to an upper baseline of joint training. The results explore the effects of how much labelled and unlabelled data is present, of which class, and where it is located in the data stream. Outlier rejection shows promising initial results where it often surpasses a baseline method of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). A baseline for CSAD is put forward along with the specific dataset setups used for reproducability and testability for other practitioners. Future research directions include other CSAD settings and further research into efficient continual hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of quantifying how an input perturbation impacts the outputs of large language models (LLMs), a fundamental task for model reliability and post-hoc interpretability. A key obstacle in this domain is disentangling the meaningful changes in model responses from the intrinsic stochasticity of LLM outputs. To overcome this, we introduce Distribution-Based Perturbation Analysis (DBPA), a framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist hypothesis testing problem. DBPA constructs empirical null and alternative output distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte Carlo sampling. Comparisons of Monte Carlo estimates in the reduced dimensionality space enables tractable frequentist inference without relying on restrictive distributional assumptions. The framework is model-agnostic, supports the evaluation of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, yields interpretable p-values, supports multiple perturbation testing via controlled error rates, and provides scalar effect sizes for any chosen similarity or distance metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DBPA in evaluating perturbation impacts, showing its versatility for perturbation analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emily Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural collapse is a phenomenon observed during the terminal phase of neural network training, characterized by the convergence of network activations, class means, and linear classifier weights to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF), a configuration of vectors that maximizes mutual distance within a subspace. This phenomenon has been linked to improved interpretability, robustness, and generalization in neural networks. However, its potential to guide neural network training and regularization remains underexplored. Previous research has demonstrated that constraining the final layer of a neural network to a simplex ETF can reduce the number of trainable parameters without sacrificing model accuracy. Furthermore, deep fully connected networks exhibit neural collapse not only in the final layer but across all layers beyond a specific effective depth. Using these insights, we propose two novel training approaches: Adaptive-ETF, a generalized framework that enforces simplex ETF constraints on all layers beyond the effective depth, and ETF-Transformer, which applies simplex ETF constraints to the feedforward layers within transformer blocks. We show that these approaches achieve training and testing performance comparable to those of their baseline counterparts while significantly reducing the number of learnable parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are vital in modern biomedicine, enabling the effective delivery of mRNA for vaccines and therapies by protecting it from rapid degradation. Among the components of LNPs, ionizable lipids play a key role in RNA protection and facilitate its delivery into the cytoplasm. However, designing ionizable lipids is complex. Deep generative models can accelerate this process and explore a larger candidate space compared to traditional methods. Due to the structural differences between lipids and small molecules, existing generative models used for small molecule generation are unsuitable for lipid generation. To address this, we developed a deep generative model specifically tailored for the discovery of ionizable lipids. Our model generates novel ionizable lipid structures and provides synthesis paths using synthetically accessible building blocks, addressing synthesizability. This advancement holds promise for streamlining the development of lipid-based delivery systems, potentially accelerating the deployment of new therapeutic agents, including mRNA vaccines and gene therapies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Calibration is a frequently invoked concept when useful label probability estimates are required on top of classification accuracy. A calibrated model is a function whose values correctly reflect underlying label probabilities. Calibration in itself however does not imply classification accuracy, nor human interpretable estimates, nor is it straightforward to verify calibration from finite data. There is a plethora of evaluation metrics (and loss functions) that each assess a specific aspect of a calibration model. In this work, we initiate an axiomatic study of the notion of calibration. We catalogue desirable properties of calibrated models as well as corresponding evaluation metrics and analyze their feasibility and correspondences. We complement this analysis with an empirical evaluation, comparing common calibration methods to employing a simple, interpretable decision tree.</p>

This work proposes replacing nonlinearities in convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with bilinear variants, to produce a class of models for which these limitations can be addressed. We show bilinear model variants perform comparably in model-free reinforcement learning settings, and give a side by side comparison on ProcGen environments. Bilinear layers' analytic structure enables weight-based decomposition. Previous work has shown bilinearity enables quantifying functional importance through eigendecomposition, to identify interpretable low rank structure. We show how to adapt the decomposition to convolution layers by applying singular value decomposition to vectors of interest, to separate the channel and spatial dimensions. Finally, we propose a methodology for causally validating concept-based probes, and illustrate its utility by studying a maze-solving agent's ability to track a cheese object.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Lenzen, Amogh Raut, Andrew Melnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the STEVE-1 approach has been introduced as a method for training generative agents to follow instructions in the form of latent CLIP embeddings. In this work, we present a methodology to extend the control modalities by learning a mapping from new input modalities to the latent goal space of the agent. We apply our approach to the challenging Minecraft domain, and extend the goal conditioning to include the audio modality. The resulting audio-conditioned agent is able to perform on a comparable level to the original text-conditioned and visual-conditioned agents. Specifically, we create an Audio-Video CLIP foundation model for Minecraft and an audio prior network which together map audio samples to the latent goal space of the STEVE-1 policy. Additionally, we highlight the tradeoffs that occur when conditioning on different modalities. Our training code, evaluation code, and Audio-Video CLIP foundation model for Minecraft are made open-source to help foster further research into multi-modal generalist sequential decision-making agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Aliakbarpour, Piotr Indyk, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Sandeep Silwal</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of hypothesis testing for discrete distributions. In the standard model, where we have sample access to an underlying distribution $p$, extensive research has established optimal bounds for uniformity testing, identity testing (goodness of fit), and closeness testing (equivalence or two-sample testing). We explore these problems in a setting where a predicted data distribution, possibly derived from historical data or predictive machine learning models, is available. We demonstrate that such a predictor can indeed reduce the number of samples required for all three property testing tasks. The reduction in sample complexity depends directly on the predictor's quality, measured by its total variation distance from $p$. A key advantage of our algorithms is their adaptability to the precision of the prediction. Specifically, our algorithms can self-adjust their sample complexity based on the accuracy of the available prediction, operating without any prior knowledge of the estimation's accuracy (i.e. they are consistent). Additionally, we never use more samples than the standard approaches require, even if the predictions provide no meaningful information (i.e. they are also robust). We provide lower bounds to indicate that the improvements in sample complexity achieved by our algorithms are information-theoretically optimal. Furthermore, experimental results show that the performance of our algorithms on real data significantly exceeds our worst-case guarantees for sample complexity, demonstrating the practicality of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Wang, Haozhu Wang, Yanjun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision transformers recast reinforcement learning as a conditional sequence generation problem, offering a simple but effective alternative to traditional value or policy-based methods. A recent key development in this area is the integration of prompting in decision transformers to facilitate few-shot policy generalization. However, current methods mainly use static prompt segments to guide rollouts, limiting their ability to provide context-specific guidance. Addressing this, we introduce a hierarchical prompting approach enabled by retrieval augmentation. Our method learns two layers of soft tokens as guiding prompts: (1) global tokens encapsulating task-level information about trajectories, and (2) adaptive tokens that deliver focused, timestep-specific instructions. The adaptive tokens are dynamically retrieved from a curated set of demonstration segments, ensuring context-aware guidance. Experiments across seven benchmark tasks in the MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments demonstrate the proposed approach consistently outperforms all baseline methods, suggesting that hierarchical prompting for decision transformers is an effective strategy to enable few-shot policy generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: It is well-known that Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to manipulated updates from clients. In this work we study the impact of data heterogeneity on clients' incentives to manipulate their updates. We formulate a game in which clients may upscale their gradient updates in order to ``steer'' the server model to their advantage. We develop a payment rule that disincentivizes sending large gradient updates, and steers the clients towards truthfully reporting their gradients. We also derive explicit bounds on the clients' payments and the convergence rate of the global model, which allows us to study the trade-off between heterogeneity, payments and convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kay Liu, Jiahao Ding, MohamadAli Torkamani, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: While Transformers have revolutionized machine learning on various data, existing Transformers for temporal graphs face limitations in (1) restricted receptive fields, (2) overhead of subgraph extraction, and (3) suboptimal generalization capability beyond link prediction. In this paper, we rethink temporal graph Transformers and propose TGTOD, a novel end-to-end Temporal Graph Transformer for Outlier Detection. TGTOD employs global attention to model both structural and temporal dependencies within temporal graphs. To tackle scalability, our approach divides large temporal graphs into spatiotemporal patches, which are then processed by a hierarchical Transformer architecture comprising Patch Transformer, Cluster Transformer, and Temporal Transformer. We evaluate TGTOD on three public datasets under two settings, comparing with a wide range of baselines. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TGTOD, achieving AP improvement of 61% on Elliptic. Furthermore, our efficiency evaluation shows that TGTOD reduces training time by 44x compared to existing Transformers for temporal graphs. To foster reproducibility, we make our implementation publicly available at https://github.com/kayzliu/tgtod.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Cai, Xiangyu Liu, Argyris Oikonomou, Kaiqing Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Partial observability of the underlying states generally presents significant challenges for reinforcement learning (RL). In practice, certain \emph{privileged information}, e.g., the access to states from simulators, has been exploited in training and has achieved prominent empirical successes. To better understand the benefits of privileged information, we revisit and examine several simple and practically used paradigms in this setting. Specifically, we first formalize the empirical paradigm of \emph{expert distillation} (also known as \emph{teacher-student} learning), demonstrating its pitfall in finding near-optimal policies. We then identify a condition of the partially observable environment, the \emph{deterministic filter condition}, under which expert distillation achieves sample and computational complexities that are \emph{both} polynomial. Furthermore, we investigate another useful empirical paradigm of \emph{asymmetric actor-critic}, and focus on the more challenging setting of observable partially observable Markov decision processes. We develop a belief-weighted asymmetric actor-critic algorithm with polynomial sample and quasi-polynomial computational complexities, in which one key component is a new provable oracle for learning belief states that preserve \emph{filter stability} under a misspecified model, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we also investigate the provable efficiency of partially observable multi-agent RL (MARL) with privileged information. We develop algorithms featuring \emph{centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution}, a popular framework in empirical MARL, with polynomial sample and (quasi-)polynomial computational complexities in both paradigms above. Compared with a few recent related theoretical studies, our focus is on understanding practically inspired algorithmic paradigms, without computationally intractable oracles.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00994">DSSRNN: Decomposition-Enhanced State-Space Recurrent Neural Network for Time-Series Analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Mohammadshirazi, Ali Nosratifiroozsalari, Rajiv Ramnath</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is a crucial yet challenging task in machine learning, requiring domain-specific knowledge due to its wide-ranging applications. While recent Transformer models have improved forecasting capabilities, they come with high computational costs. Linear-based models have shown better accuracy than Transformers but still fall short of ideal performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Decomposition State-Space Recurrent Neural Network (DSSRNN), a novel framework designed for both long-term and short-term time series forecasting. DSSRNN uniquely combines decomposition analysis to capture seasonal and trend components with state-space models and physics-based equations. We evaluate DSSRNN's performance on indoor air quality datasets, focusing on CO2 concentration prediction across various forecasting horizons. Results demonstrate that DSSRNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, including transformer-based architectures, in terms of both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). For example, at the shortest horizon (T=96) in Office 1, DSSRNN achieved an MSE of 0.378 and an MAE of 0.401, significantly lower than competing models. Additionally, DSSRNN exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to more complex models. While not as lightweight as the DLinear model, DSSRNN achieves a balance between performance and efficiency, with only 0.11G MACs and 437MiB memory usage, and an inference time of 0.58ms for long-term forecasting. This work not only showcases DSSRNN's success but also establishes a new benchmark for physics-informed machine learning in environmental forecasting and potentially other domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01003">Competition Dynamics Shape Algorithmic Phases of In-Context Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Core Francisco Park, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Itamar Pres, Hidenori Tanaka</p>
<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.</p>

<p>Abstract: To combat the rising energy consumption of recommender systems we implement a novel alternative for k-fold cross validation. This alternative, named e-fold cross validation, aims to minimize the number of folds to achieve a reduction in power usage while keeping the reliability and robustness of the test results high. We tested our method on 5 recommender system algorithms across 6 datasets and compared it with 10-fold cross validation. On average e-fold cross validation only needed 41.5% of the energy that 10-fold cross validation would need, while it's results only differed by 1.81%. We conclude that e-fold cross validation is a promising approach that has the potential to be an energy efficient but still reliable alternative to k-fold cross validation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01013">Jacobian-Enforced Neural Networks (JENN) for Improved Data Assimilation Consistency in Dynamical Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxu Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning-based weather models have shown great promise in producing accurate forecasts but have struggled when applied to data assimilation tasks, unlike traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This study introduces the Jacobian-Enforced Neural Network (JENN) framework, designed to enhance DA consistency in neural network (NN)-emulated dynamical systems. Using the Lorenz 96 model as an example, the approach demonstrates improved applicability of NNs in DA through explicit enforcement of Jacobian relationships. The NN architecture includes an input layer of 40 neurons, two hidden layers with 256 units each employing hyperbolic tangent activation functions, and an output layer of 40 neurons without activation.
  The JENN framework employs a two-step training process: an initial phase using standard prediction-label pairs to establish baseline forecast capability, followed by a secondary phase incorporating a customized loss function to enforce accurate Jacobian relationships. This loss function combines root mean square error (RMSE) between predicted and true state values with additional RMSE terms for tangent linear (TL) and adjoint (AD) emulation results, weighted to balance forecast accuracy and Jacobian sensitivity. To ensure consistency, the secondary training phase uses additional pairs of TL/AD inputs and labels calculated from the physical models. Notably, this approach does not require starting from scratch or structural modifications to the NN, making it readily applicable to pretrained models such as GraphCast, NeuralGCM, Pangu, or FuXi, facilitating their adaptation for DA tasks with minimal reconfiguration. Experimental results demonstrate that the JENN framework preserves nonlinear forecast performance while significantly reducing noise in the TL and AD components, as well as in the overall Jacobian matrix.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01014">Detecting Memorization in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Slonski</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural language processing but are prone to memorizing portions of their training data, which can compromise evaluation metrics, raise privacy concerns, and limit generalization. Traditional methods for detecting memorization rely on output probabilities or loss functions, often lacking precision due to confounding factors like common language patterns. In this paper, we introduce an analytical method that precisely detects memorization by examining neuron activations within the LLM. By identifying specific activation patterns that differentiate between memorized and not memorized tokens, we train classification probes that achieve near-perfect accuracy. The approach can also be applied to other mechanisms, such as repetition, as demonstrated in this study, highlighting its versatility. Intervening on these activations allows us to suppress memorization without degrading overall performance, enhancing evaluation integrity by ensuring metrics reflect genuine generalization. Additionally, our method supports large-scale labeling of tokens and sequences, crucial for next-generation AI models, improving training efficiency and results. Our findings contribute to model interpretability and offer practical tools for analyzing and controlling internal mechanisms in LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01023">Learning Structured Representations with Hyperbolic Embeddings</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Sinha, Siqi Zeng, Makoto Yamada, Han Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Most real-world datasets consist of a natural hierarchy between classes or an inherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed cheaply. However, most existing representation learning methods ignore this hierarchy, treating labels as permutation invariant. Recent work [Zeng et al., 2022] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of Euclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [Chen et al., 2013]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in modeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure: a Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label hierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a simple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based representation loss along with a centering loss, and can be combined with any standard task loss to learn hierarchy-informed features. Extensive experiments on several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance especially under low dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of structured representation, we perform eigenvalue analysis that links the representation geometry to improved Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection performance seen empirically.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupeng Tan, Sheng Xu, Chengyue Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent streetlight systems divide the streetlight network into multiple sectors, activating only the streetlights in the corresponding sectors when traffic elements pass by, rather than all streetlights, effectively reducing energy waste. This strategy requires streetlights to understand their neighbor relationships to illuminate only the streetlights in their respective sectors. However, manually configuring the neighbor relationships for a large number of streetlights in complex large-scale road streetlight networks is cumbersome and prone to errors. Due to the crisscrossing nature of roads, it is also difficult to determine the neighbor relationships using GPS or communication positioning. In response to these issues, this article proposes a systematic approach to model the streetlight network as a social network and construct a neighbor relationship probabilistic graph using IoT event records of streetlights detecting traffic elements. Based on this, a multi-objective genetic algorithm based probabilistic graph clustering method is designed to discover the neighbor relationships of streetlights. Considering the characteristic that pedestrians and vehicles usually move at a constant speed on a section of a road, speed consistency is introduced as an optimization objective, which, together with traditional similarity measures, forms a multi-objective function, enhancing the accuracy of neighbor relationship discovery. Extensive experiments on simulation datasets were conducted, comparing the proposed algorithm with other probabilistic graph clustering algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can more accurately identify the neighbor relationships of streetlights compared to other algorithms, effectively achieving adaptive streetlight control for traffic elements.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) represents a pivotal and intensely competitive domain within the financial markets. The velocity and accuracy of data processing exert a direct influence on profitability, underscoring the significance of this field. The objective of this work is to optimise the real-time processing of data in high-frequency trading algorithms. The dynamic feature selection mechanism is responsible for monitoring and analysing market data in real time through clustering and feature weight analysis, with the objective of automatically selecting the most relevant features. This process employs an adaptive feature extraction method, which enables the system to respond and adjust its feature set in a timely manner when the data input changes, thus ensuring the efficient utilisation of data. The lightweight neural networks are designed in a modular fashion, comprising fast convolutional layers and pruning techniques that facilitate the expeditious completion of data processing and output prediction. In contrast to conventional deep learning models, the neural network architecture has been specifically designed to minimise the number of parameters and computational complexity, thereby markedly reducing the inference time. The experimental results demonstrate that the model is capable of maintaining consistent performance in the context of varying market conditions, thereby illustrating its advantages in terms of processing speed and revenue enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexi Liu, Meng Cao, Songcan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Irregularly sampled multivariate time series (ISMTS) are prevalent in reality. Most existing methods treat ISMTS as synchronized regularly sampled time series with missing values, neglecting that the irregularities are primarily attributed to variations in sampling rates. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective that irregularity is essentially relative in some senses. With sampling rates artificially determined from low to high, an irregularly sampled time series can be transformed into a hierarchical set of relatively regular time series from coarse to fine. We observe that additional coarse-grained relatively regular series not only mitigate the irregularly sampled challenges to some extent but also incorporate broad-view temporal information, thereby serving as a valuable asset for representation learning. Therefore, following the philosophy of learning that Seeing the big picture first, then delving into the details, we present the Multi-Scale and Multi-Correlation Attention Network (MuSiCNet) combining multiple scales to iteratively refine the ISMTS representation. Specifically, within each scale, we explore time attention and frequency correlation matrices to aggregate intra- and inter-series information, naturally enhancing the representation quality with richer and more intrinsic details. While across adjacent scales, we employ a representation rectification method containing contrastive learning and reconstruction results adjustment to further improve representation consistency. MuSiCNet is an ISMTS analysis framework that competitive with SOTA in three mainstream tasks consistently, including classification, interpolation, and forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqun Zuo, Tian Xie, Xuwei Tan, Xueru Zhang, Mohammad Mahdi Khalili</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are used in applications that involve humans, concerns have arisen that these algorithms may be biased against certain social groups. \textit{Counterfactual fairness} (CF) is a fairness notion proposed in Kusner et al. (2017) that measures the unfairness of ML predictions; it requires that the prediction perceived by an individual in the real world has the same marginal distribution as it would be in a counterfactual world, in which the individual belongs to a different group. Although CF ensures fair ML predictions, it fails to consider the downstream effects of ML predictions on individuals. Since humans are strategic and often adapt their behaviors in response to the ML system, predictions that satisfy CF may not lead to a fair future outcome for the individuals. In this paper, we introduce \textit{lookahead counterfactual fairness} (LCF), a fairness notion accounting for the downstream effects of ML models which requires the individual \textit{future status} to be counterfactually fair. We theoretically identify conditions under which LCF can be satisfied and propose an algorithm based on the theorems. We also extend the concept to path-dependent fairness. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Truck platooning technology enables a group of trucks to travel closely together, with which the platoon can save fuel, improve traffic flow efficiency, and improve safety. In this paper, we consider the platoon coordination problem in a large-scale transportation network, to promote cooperation among trucks and optimize the overall efficiency. Involving the regulation of both speed and departure times at hubs, we formulate the coordination problem as a complicated dynamic stochastic integer programming under network and information constraints. To get an autonomous, distributed, and robust platoon coordination policy, we formulate the problem into a model of the Decentralized-Partial Observable Markov Decision Process. Then, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning framework named Trcuk Attention-QMIX (TA-QMIX) to train an efficient online decision policy. TA-QMIX utilizes the attention mechanism to enhance the representation of truck fuel gains and delay times, and provides explicit truck cooperation information during the training process, promoting trucks' willingness to cooperate. The training framework adopts centralized training and distributed execution, thus training a policy for trucks to make decisions online using only nearby information. Hence, the policy can be autonomously executed on a large-scale network. Finally, we perform comparison experiments and ablation experiments in the transportation network of the Yangtze River Delta region in China to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In a repeated comparative experiment with 5,000 trucks, our method average saves 19.17\% of fuel with an average delay of only 9.57 minutes per truck and a decision time of 0.001 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianwang Jia, Lubin Meng, Siyang Li, Jiajing Liu, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Training an accurate classifier for EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) requires EEG data from a large number of users, whereas protecting their data privacy is a critical consideration. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution to this challenge. This paper proposes Federated classification with local Batch-specific batch normalization and Sharpness-aware minimization (FedBS) for privacy protection in EEG-based motor imagery (MI) classification. FedBS utilizes local batch-specific batch normalization to reduce data discrepancies among different clients, and sharpness-aware minimization optimizer in local training to improve model generalization. Experiments on three public MI datasets using three popular deep learning models demonstrated that FedBS outperformed six state-of-the-art FL approaches. Remarkably, it also outperformed centralized training, which does not consider privacy protection at all. In summary, FedBS protects user EEG data privacy, enabling multiple BCI users to participate in large-scale machine learning model training, which in turn improves the BCI decoding accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wang, Herui Zhang, Siyang Li, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to simulate real neural networks in the human brain with biologically plausible neurons. The leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron is one of the most widely studied SNN architectures. However, it has the vanishing gradient problem when trained with backpropagation. Additionally, its neuronal parameters are often manually specified and fixed, in contrast to the heterogeneity of real neurons in the human brain. This paper proposes a gated parametric neuron (GPN) to process spatio-temporal information effectively with the gating mechanism. Compared with the LIF neuron, the GPN has two distinguishing advantages: 1) it copes well with the vanishing gradients by improving the flow of gradient propagation; and, 2) it learns spatio-temporal heterogeneous neuronal parameters automatically. Additionally, we use the same gate structure to eliminate initial neuronal parameter selection and design a hybrid recurrent neural network-SNN structure. Experiments on two spike-based audio datasets demonstrated that the GPN network outperformed several state-of-the-art SNNs, could mitigate vanishing gradients, and had spatio-temporal heterogeneous parameters. Our work shows the ability of SNNs to handle long-term dependencies and achieve high performance simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ricardo Augusto Borsoi, Konstantin Usevich, David Brie, T\"ulay Adali</p>
<p>Abstract: Coupled tensor decompositions (CTDs) perform data fusion by linking factors from different datasets. Although many CTDs have been already proposed, current works do not address important challenges of data fusion, where: 1) the datasets are often heterogeneous, constituting different "views" of a given phenomena (multimodality); and 2) each dataset can contain personalized or dataset-specific information, constituting distinct factors that are not coupled with other datasets. In this work, we introduce a personalized CTD framework tackling these challenges. A flexible model is proposed where each dataset is represented as the sum of two components, one related to a common tensor through a multilinear measurement model, and another specific to each dataset. Both the common and distinct components are assumed to admit a polyadic decomposition. This generalizes several existing CTD models. We provide conditions for specific and generic uniqueness of the decomposition that are easy to interpret. These conditions employ uni-mode uniqueness of different individual datasets and properties of the measurement model. Two algorithms are proposed to compute the common and distinct components: a semi-algebraic one and a coordinate-descent optimization method. Experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed framework compared with the state of the art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zuobai Zhang, Pascal Notin, Yining Huang, Aur\'elie Lozano, Vijil Chenthamarakshan, Debora Marks, Payel Das, Jian Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing novel functional proteins crucially depends on accurately modeling their fitness landscape. Given the limited availability of functional annotations from wet-lab experiments, previous methods have primarily relied on self-supervised models trained on vast, unlabeled protein sequence or structure datasets. While initial protein representation learning studies solely focused on either sequence or structural features, recent hybrid architectures have sought to merge these modalities to harness their respective strengths. However, these sequence-structure models have so far achieved only incremental improvements when compared to the leading sequence-only approaches, highlighting unresolved challenges effectively leveraging these modalities together. Moreover, the function of certain proteins is highly dependent on the granular aspects of their surface topology, which have been overlooked by prior models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Sequence-Structure-Surface Fitness (S3F) model - a novel multimodal representation learning framework that integrates protein features across several scales. Our approach combines sequence representations from a protein language model with Geometric Vector Perceptron networks encoding protein backbone and detailed surface topology. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art fitness prediction on the ProteinGym benchmark encompassing 217 substitution deep mutational scanning assays, and provides insights into the determinants of protein function.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cevahir Koprulu, Po-han Li, Tianyu Qiu, Ruihan Zhao, Tyler Westenbroek, David Fridovich-Keil, Sandeep Chinchali, Ufuk Topcu</p>
<p>Abstract: Many continuous control problems can be formulated as sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. In principle, online RL methods can automatically explore the state space to solve each new task. However, discovering sequences of actions that lead to a non-zero reward becomes exponentially more difficult as the task horizon increases. Manually shaping rewards can accelerate learning for a fixed task, but it is an arduous process that must be repeated for each new environment. We introduce a systematic reward-shaping framework that distills the information contained in 1) a task-agnostic prior data set and 2) a small number of task-specific expert demonstrations, and then uses these priors to synthesize dense dynamics-aware rewards for the given task. This supervision substantially accelerates learning in our experiments, and we provide analysis demonstrating how the approach can effectively guide online learning agents to faraway goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingtian Zhu, Yumin Zheng, Yuling Sang, Yifan Zhan, Ziyan Zhu, Jun Ding, Yinqiang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a method that captures spatial gene expression profiles within histological sections. The discrete spatial distribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data challenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in a continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the great approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that can improve both the spatial resolution and the gene expression. Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods for ST super-resolution regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geonho Lee, Janghwan Lee, Sukjin Hong, Minsoo Kim, Euijai Ahn, Du-Seong Chang, Jungwook Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the dominant method for parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning, with LoRA-based quantization error compensation (LQEC) emerging as a powerful tool for recovering accuracy in compressed LLMs. However, LQEC has underperformed in sub-4-bit scenarios, with no prior investigation into understanding this limitation. We propose RILQ (Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation) to understand fundamental limitation and boost 2-bit LLM accuracy. Based on rank analysis revealing model-wise activation discrepancy loss's rank-insensitive nature, RILQ employs this loss to adjust adapters cooperatively across layers, enabling robust error compensation with low-rank adapters. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 demonstrate RILQ's consistent improvements in 2-bit quantized inference across various state-of-the-art quantizers and enhanced accuracy in task-specific fine-tuning. RILQ maintains computational efficiency comparable to existing LoRA methods, enabling adapter-merged weight-quantized LLM inference with significantly enhanced accuracy, making it a promising approach for boosting 2-bit LLM performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung-Hieu Hoang, Duc Minh Vo, Minh N. Do</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle the continual domain shift in machine learning by allowing model parameters to change at test time, via self-supervised learning on unlabeled testing data. At the same time, it unfortunately opens the door to unforeseen vulnerabilities for degradation over time. Through a simple theoretical continual TTA model, we successfully identify a risk in the sampling process of testing data that could easily degrade the performance of a continual TTA model. We name this risk as Reusing of Incorrect Prediction (RIP) that TTA attackers can employ or as a result of the unintended query from general TTA users. The risk posed by RIP is also highly realistic, as it does not require prior knowledge of model parameters or modification of testing samples. This simple requirement makes RIP as the first black-box TTA attack algorithm that stands out from existing white-box attempts. We extensively benchmark the performance of the most recent continual TTA approaches when facing the RIP attack, providing insights on its success, and laying out potential roadmaps that could enhance the resilience of future continual TTA systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shintaro Fukushima, Kenji Yamanishi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the issue of graph generation with generative models. In particular, we are concerned with graph community augmentation problem, which refers to the problem of generating unseen or unfamiliar graphs with a new community out of the probability distribution estimated with a given graph dataset. The graph community augmentation means that the generated graphs have a new community. There is a chance of discovering an unseen but important structure of graphs with a new community, for example, in a social network such as a purchaser network. Graph community augmentation may also be helpful for generalization of data mining models in a case where it is difficult to collect real graph data enough. In fact, there are many ways to generate a new community in an existing graph. It is desirable to discover a new graph with a new community beyond the given graph while we keep the structure of the original graphs to some extent for the generated graphs to be realistic. To this end, we propose an algorithm called the graph community augmentation (GCA). The key ideas of GCA are (i) to fit Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to data points in the latent space into which the nodes in the original graph are embedded, and (ii) to add data points in the new cluster in the latent space for generating a new community based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of GCA for generating graphs with a new community structure on synthetic and real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pamely Zantou, Blessed Guda, Bereket Retta, Gladys Inabeza, Carlee Joe-Wong, Assane Gueye</p>
<p>Abstract: Birth Apshyxia (BA) is a severe condition characterized by insufficient supply of oxygen to a newborn during the delivery. BA is one of the primary causes of neonatal death in the world. Although there has been a decline in neonatal deaths over the past two decades, the developing world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, continues to experience the highest under-five (<5) mortality rates. While evidence-based methods are commonly used to detect BA in African healthcare settings, they can be subject to physician errors or delays in diagnosis, preventing timely interventions. Centralized Machine Learning (ML) methods demonstrated good performance in early detection of BA but require sensitive health data to leave their premises before training, which does not guarantee privacy and security. Healthcare institutions are therefore reluctant to adopt such solutions in Africa. To address this challenge, we suggest a federated learning (FL)-based software architecture, a distributed learning method that prioritizes privacy and security by design. We have developed a user-friendly and cost-effective mobile application embedding the FL pipeline for early detection of BA. Our Federated SVM model outperformed centralized SVM pipelines and Neural Networks (NN)-based methods in the existing literature</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Xu, Xue Jiang, Dongrui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition is a critical component of affective computing. Training accurate machine learning models for emotion recognition typically requires a large amount of labeled data. Due to the subtleness and complexity of emotions, multiple evaluators are usually needed for each affective sample to obtain its ground-truth label, which is expensive. To save the labeling cost, this paper proposes an inconsistency-based active learning approach for cross-task transfer between emotion classification and estimation. Affective norms are utilized as prior knowledge to connect the label spaces of categorical and dimensional emotions. Then, the prediction inconsistency on the two tasks for the unlabeled samples is used to guide sample selection in active learning for the target task. Experiments on within-corpus and cross-corpus transfers demonstrated that cross-task inconsistency could be a very valuable metric in active learning. To our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes prior knowledge on affective norms and data in a different task to facilitate active learning for a new task, even the two tasks are from different datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep generative models have achieved tremendous success in structure-based drug design in recent years, especially for generating 3D ligand molecules that bind to specific protein pocket. Notably, diffusion models have transformed ligand generation by providing exceptional quality and creativity. However, traditional diffusion models are restricted by their conventional learning objectives, which limit their broader applicability. In this work, we propose a new framework FlowSBDD, which is based on rectified flow model, allows us to flexibly incorporate additional loss to optimize specific target and introduce additional condition either as an extra input condition or replacing the initial Gaussian distribution. Extensive experiments on CrossDocked2020 show that our approach could achieve state-of-the-art performance on generating high-affinity molecules while maintaining proper molecular properties without specifically designing binding site, with up to -8.50 Avg.

<p>Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in improving predictive performance and estimating uncertainty in neural networks. However, conventional ensemble methods often suffer from redundant parameter usage and computational inefficiencies due to entirely independent network training. To address these challenges, we propose the Divergent Ensemble Network (DEN), a novel architecture that combines shared representation learning with independent branching. DEN employs a shared input layer to capture common features across all branches, followed by divergent, independently trainable layers that form an ensemble. This shared-to-branching structure reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining ensemble diversity, enabling efficient and scalable learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songjie Xie, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to the practical demands of the ``right to be forgotten" and the removal of undesired data, machine unlearning emerges as an essential technique to remove the learned knowledge of a fraction of data points from trained models. However, existing methods suffer from limitations such as insufficient methodological support, high computational complexity, and significant memory demands. In this work, we propose the concepts of knowledge vaporization and concentration to selectively erase learned knowledge from specific data points while maintaining representations for the remaining data. Utilizing the Siamese networks, we exemplify the proposed concepts and develop an efficient method for machine unlearning. Our proposed Siamese unlearning method does not require additional memory overhead and full access to the remaining dataset. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple unlearning scenarios showcase the superiority of Siamese unlearning over baseline methods, illustrating its ability to effectively remove knowledge from forgetting data, enhance model utility on remaining data, and reduce susceptibility to membership inference attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ling Huang, Yucheng Xing, Qika Lin, Su Ruan, Mengling Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal survival analysis aims to combine heterogeneous data sources (e.g., clinical, imaging, text, genomics) to improve the prediction quality of survival outcomes. However, this task is particularly challenging due to high heterogeneity and noise across data sources, which vary in structure, distribution, and context. Additionally, the ground truth is often censored (uncertain) due to incomplete follow-up data. In this paper, we propose a novel evidential multimodal survival fusion model, EsurvFusion, designed to combine multimodal data at the decision level through an evidence-based decision fusion layer that jointly addresses both data and model uncertainty while incorporating modality-level reliability. Specifically, EsurvFusion first models unimodal data with newly introduced Gaussian random fuzzy numbers, producing unimodal survival predictions along with corresponding aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. It then estimates modality-level reliability through a reliability discounting layer to correct the misleading impact of noisy data modalities. Finally, a multimodal evidence-based fusion layer is introduced to combine the discounted predictions to form a unified, interpretable multimodal survival analysis model, revealing each modality's influence based on the learned reliability coefficients. This is the first work that studies multimodal survival analysis with both uncertainty and reliability. Extensive experiments on four multimodal survival datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in handling high heterogeneity data, establishing new state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel architecture, the Quantum Pointwise Convolution, which incorporates pointwise convolution within a quantum neural network framework. Our approach leverages the strengths of pointwise convolution to efficiently integrate information across feature channels while adjusting channel outputs. By using quantum circuits, we map data to a higher-dimensional space, capturing more complex feature relationships. To address the current limitations of quantum machine learning in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, we implement several design optimizations. These include amplitude encoding for data embedding, allowing more information to be processed with fewer qubits, and a weight-sharing mechanism that accelerates quantum pointwise convolution operations, reducing the need to retrain for each input pixels. In our experiments, we applied the quantum pointwise convolution layer to classification tasks on the FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, where our model demonstrated competitive performance compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, these optimizations not only improve the efficiency of the quantum pointwise convolutional layer but also make it more readily deployable in various CNN-based or deep learning models, broadening its potential applications across different architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models, particularly diffusion models, have achieved remarkable success in density estimation for multimodal data, drawing significant interest from the reinforcement learning (RL) community, especially in policy modeling in continuous action spaces. However, existing works exhibit significant variations in training schemes and RL optimization objectives, and some methods are only applicable to diffusion models. In this study, we compare and analyze various generative policy training and deployment techniques, identifying and validating effective designs for generative policy algorithms. Specifically, we revisit existing training objectives and classify them into two categories, each linked to a simpler approach. The first approach, Generative Model Policy Optimization (GMPO), employs a native advantage-weighted regression formulation as the training objective, which is significantly simpler than previous methods. The second approach, Generative Model Policy Gradient (GMPG), offers a numerically stable implementation of the native policy gradient method. We introduce a standardized experimental framework named GenerativeRL. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on various offline-RL datasets, offering a unified and practical guideline for training and deploying generative policies.</p>

<p>Abstract: An important factor in the practical implementation of optimization models is the acceptance by the intended users. This is influenced among other factors by the interpretability of the solution process. Decision rules that meet this requirement can be generated using the framework for inherently interpretable optimization models. In practice, there is often uncertainty about the parameters of an optimization problem. An established way to deal with this challenge is the concept of robust optimization. The goal of our work is to combine both concepts: to create decision trees as surrogates for the optimization process that are more robust to perturbations and still inherently interpretable. For this purpose we present suitable models based on different variants to model uncertainty, and solution methods. Furthermore, the applicability of heuristic methods to perform this task is evaluated. Both approaches are compared with the existing framework for inherently interpretable optimization models.</p>

We establish formal guarantees on the query complexity required to learn smooth, but otherwise general, distance functions under two notions of approximation: $\omega$-additive approximation and $(1 + \omega)$-multiplicative approximation. For the additive approximation, we propose a global method whose query complexity is quadratic in the size of a finite cover of the sample space. For the (stronger) multiplicative approximation, we introduce a method that combines global and local approaches, utilizing multiple Mahalanobis distance functions to capture local geometry. This method has a query complexity that scales quadratically with both the size of the cover and the ambient space dimension of the sample space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengzhan Zhou, Yuepeng He, Yijun Zhai, Kaixin Gao, Chao Chen, Zhida Qin, Chong Zhang, Songtao Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained popularity for its privacy-preserving and collaborative learning capabilities. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), building upon FL, aims to address the issue of statistical heterogeneity and achieve personalization. Personalized-head-based PFL is a common and effective PFL method that splits the model into a feature extractor and a head, where the feature extractor is collaboratively trained and shared, while the head is locally trained and not shared. However, retaining the head locally, although achieving personalization, prevents the model from learning global knowledge in the head, thus affecting the performance of the personalized model. To solve this problem, we propose a novel PFL method called Federated Learning with Aggregated Head (FedAH), which initializes the head with an Aggregated Head at each iteration. The key feature of FedAH is to perform element-level aggregation between the local model head and the global model head to introduce global information from the global model head. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedAH, we conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. FedAH outperforms ten state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of test accuracy by 2.87%. Additionally, FedAH maintains its advantage even in scenarios where some clients drop out unexpectedly.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Spyros Rigas, Michalis Papachristou, Ioannis Sotiropoulos, Georgios Alexandridis</p>
<p>Abstract: Rolling element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, with their performance directly influencing the efficiency and reliability of industrial systems. At the same time, bearing faults are a leading cause of machinery failures, often resulting in costly downtime, reduced productivity, and, in extreme cases, catastrophic damage. This study presents a methodology that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to address these challenges through automatic feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and interpretable fault analysis within a unified framework. By training shallow network architectures and minimizing the number of selected features, the framework produces lightweight models that deliver explainable results through feature attribution and symbolic representations of their activation functions. Validated on two widely recognized datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, the framework achieved perfect F1-Scores for fault detection and high performance in fault and severity classification tasks, including 100\% F1-Scores in most cases. Notably, it demonstrated adaptability by handling diverse fault types, such as imbalance and misalignment, within the same dataset. The symbolic representations enhanced model interpretability, while feature attribution offered insights into the optimal feature types or signals for each studied task. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical applications, such as real-time machinery monitoring, and for scientific research requiring efficient and explainable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth Remfry, Rafael Henkin, Michael R Barnes, Aakanksha Naik</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic healthcare records (EHR) contain a huge wealth of data that can support the prediction of clinical outcomes. EHR data is often stored and analysed using clinical codes (ICD10, SNOMED), however these can differ across registries and healthcare providers. Integrating data across systems involves mapping between different clinical ontologies requiring domain expertise, and at times resulting in data loss. To overcome this, code-agnostic models have been proposed. We assess the effectiveness of a code-agnostic representation approach on the task of long-term microvascular complication prediction for individuals living with Type 2 Diabetes. Our method encodes individual EHRs as text using fine-tuned, pretrained clinical language models. Leveraging large-scale EHR data from the UK, we employ a multi-label approach to simultaneously predict the risk of microvascular complications across 1-, 5-, and 10-year windows. We demonstrate that a code-agnostic approach outperforms a code-based model and illustrate that performance is better with longer prediction windows but is biased to the first occurring complication. Overall, we highlight that context length is vitally important for model performance. This study highlights the possibility of including data from across different clinical ontologies and is a starting point for generalisable clinical models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei Deng, Weijing Tang, Jiaqi W. Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Influence function, a technique rooted in robust statistics, has been adapted in modern machine learning for a novel application: data attribution -- quantifying how individual training data points affect a model's predictions. However, the common derivation of influence functions in the data attribution literature is limited to loss functions that can be decomposed into a sum of individual data point losses, with the most prominent examples known as M-estimators. This restricts the application of influence functions to more complex learning objectives, which we refer to as non-decomposable losses, such as contrastive or ranking losses, where a unit loss term depends on multiple data points and cannot be decomposed further. In this work, we bridge this gap by revisiting the general formulation of influence function from robust statistics, which extends beyond M-estimators. Based on this formulation, we propose a novel method, the Versatile Influence Function (VIF), that can be straightforwardly applied to machine learning models trained with any non-decomposable loss. In comparison to the classical approach in statistics, the proposed VIF is designed to fully leverage the power of auto-differentiation, hereby eliminating the need for case-specific derivations of each loss function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VIF across three examples: Cox regression for survival analysis, node embedding for network analysis, and listwise learning-to-rank for information retrieval. In all cases, the influence estimated by VIF closely resembles the results obtained by brute-force leave-one-out retraining, while being up to $10^3$ times faster to compute. We believe VIF represents a significant advancement in data attribution, enabling efficient influence-function-based attribution across a wide range of machine learning paradigms, with broad potential for practical use cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyi Chen, Ying Chen, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the performative policy learning problem, where agents adjust their features in response to a released policy to improve their potential outcomes, inducing an endogenous distribution shift. There has been growing interest in training machine learning models in strategic environments, including strategic classification and performative prediction. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions: micro-level utility models in strategic classification and macro-level data distribution maps in performative prediction, severely limiting scalability and generalizability. We approach this problem as a complex causal inference task, relaxing parametric assumptions on both micro-level agent behavior and macro-level data distribution. Leveraging bounded rationality, we uncover a practical low-dimensional structure in distribution shifts and construct an effective mediator in the causal path from the deployed model to the shifted data. We then propose a gradient-based policy optimization algorithm with a differentiable classifier as a substitute for the high-dimensional distribution map. Our algorithm efficiently utilizes batch feedback and limited manipulation patterns. Our approach achieves high sample efficiency compared to methods reliant on bandit feedback or zero-order optimization. We also provide theoretical guarantees for algorithmic convergence. Extensive and challenging experiments on high-dimensional settings demonstrate our method's practical efficacy.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present an online planning framework for solving multi-object rearrangement problems in partially observable, multi-room environments. Current object rearrangement solutions, primarily based on Reinforcement Learning or hand-coded planning methods, often lack adaptability to diverse challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Object-Oriented Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (HOO-POMDP) planning approach. This approach comprises of (a) an object-oriented POMDP planner generating sub-goals, (b) a set of low-level policies for sub-goal achievement, and (c) an abstraction system converting the continuous low-level world into a representation suitable for abstract planning. We evaluate our system on varying numbers of objects, rooms, and problem types in AI2-THOR simulated environments with promising results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen-Dong Jiang, Chih-Yung Chang, Show-Jane Yen, Diptendu Sinha Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in processing and managing unstructured data. However, its "black box" nature imposes significant limitations, particularly in sensitive application domains. While existing interpretable machine learning methods address some of these issues, they often fail to adequately consider feature correlations and provide insufficient evaluation of model decision paths. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Real Explainer (RealExp), an interpretability computation method that decouples the Shapley Value into individual feature importance and feature correlation importance. By incorporating feature similarity computations, RealExp enhances interpretability by precisely quantifying both individual feature contributions and their interactions, leading to more reliable and nuanced explanations. Additionally, this paper proposes a novel interpretability evaluation criterion focused on elucidating the decision paths of deep learning models, going beyond traditional accuracy-based metrics. Experimental validations on two unstructured data tasks -- image classification and text sentiment analysis -- demonstrate that RealExp significantly outperforms existing methods in interpretability. Case studies further illustrate its practical value: in image classification, RealExp aids in selecting suitable pre-trained models for specific tasks from an interpretability perspective; in text classification, it enables the optimization of models and approximates the performance of a fine-tuned GPT-Ada model using traditional bag-of-words approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiakai Wang, Pengfei Zhang, Renshuai Tao, Jian Yang, Hao Liu, Xianglong Liu, Yunchao Wei, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: The various post-processing methods for deep-learning-based models, such as quantification, pruning, and fine-tuning, play an increasingly important role in artificial intelligence technology, with pre-train large models as one of the main development directions. However, this popular series of post-processing behaviors targeting pre-training deep models has become a breeding ground for new adversarial security issues. In this study, we take the first step towards ``behavioral backdoor'' attack, which is defined as a behavior-triggered backdoor model training procedure, to reveal a new paradigm of backdoor attacks. In practice, we propose the first pipeline of implementing behavior backdoor, i.e., the Quantification Backdoor (QB) attack, upon exploiting model quantification method as the set trigger. Specifically, to adapt the optimization goal of behavior backdoor, we introduce the behavior-driven backdoor object optimizing method by a bi-target behavior backdoor training loss, thus we could guide the poisoned model optimization direction. To update the parameters across multiple models, we adopt the address-shared backdoor model training, thereby the gradient information could be utilized for multimodel collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments have been conducted on different models, datasets, and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel backdoor attack and its potential application threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Federici, Davide Belli, Mart van Baalen, Amir Jalalirad, Andrii Skliar, Bence Major, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough</p>
<p>Abstract: While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katarzyna Janocha, Annabel Ling, Alice Godson, Yulia Lampi, Simon Bornschein, Nils Y. Hammerla</p>
<p>Abstract: Cell and immunotherapy offer transformative potential for treating diseases like cancer and autoimmune disorders by modulating the immune system. The development of these therapies is resource-intensive, with the majority of drug candidates failing to progress beyond laboratory testing. While recent advances in machine learning have revolutionised areas such as protein engineering, applications in immunotherapy remain limited due to the scarcity of large-scale, standardised datasets and the complexity of cellular systems. In this work, we address these challenges by leveraging a high-throughput experimental platform to generate data suitable for fine-tuning protein language models. We demonstrate how models fine-tuned using a preference task show surprising correlations to biological assays, and how they can be leveraged for few-shot hit maturation in CARs. This proof-of-concept presents a novel pathway for applying ML to immunotherapy and could generalise to other therapeutic modalities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancements in machine learning have made its application to anomalous diffusion analysis both essential and inevitable. This review systematically introduces the integration of machine learning techniques for enhanced analysis of anomalous diffusion, focusing on two pivotal aspects: single trajectory characterization via machine learning and representation learning of anomalous diffusion. We extensively compare various machine learning methods, including both classical machine learning and deep learning, used for the inference of diffusion parameters and trajectory segmentation. Additionally, platforms such as the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge that serve as benchmarks for evaluating these methods are highlighted. On the other hand, we outline three primary strategies for representing anomalous diffusion: the combination of predefined features, the feature vector from the penultimate layer of neural network, and the latent representation from the autoencoder, analyzing their applicability across various scenarios. This investigation paves the way for future research, offering valuable perspectives that can further enrich the study of anomalous diffusion and advance the application of artificial intelligence in statistical physics and biophysics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Pang, Sibo Cheng, Yuhan Huang, Yufang Jin, Yike Guo, I. Colin Prentice, Sandy P. Harrison, Rossella Arcucci</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the extent of massive wildfires once ignited is essential to reduce the subsequent socioeconomic losses and environmental damage, but challenging because of the complexity of fire behaviour. Existing physics-based models are limited in predicting large or long-duration wildfire events. Here, we develop a deep-learning-based predictive model, Fire-Image-DenseNet (FIDN), that uses spatial features derived from both near real-time and reanalysis data on the environmental and meteorological drivers of wildfire. We trained and tested this model using more than 300 individual wildfires that occurred between 2012 and 2019 in the western US. In contrast to existing models, the performance of FIDN does not degrade with fire size or duration. Furthermore, it predicts final burnt area accurately even in very heterogeneous landscapes in terms of fuel density and flammability. The FIDN model showed higher accuracy, with a mean squared error (MSE) about 82% and 67% lower than those of the predictive models based on cellular automata (CA) and the minimum travel time (MTT) approaches, respectively. Its structural similarity index measure (SSIM) averages 97%, outperforming the CA and FlamMap MTT models by 6% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, FIDN is approximately three orders of magnitude faster than both CA and MTT models. The enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy advancements offer vital insights for strategic planning and resource allocation for firefighting operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Wang, Chengcheng Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate origin-destination (OD) passenger flow prediction is crucial for enhancing metro system efficiency, optimizing scheduling, and improving passenger experiences. However, current models often fail to effectively capture the asynchronous departure characteristics of OD flows and underutilize the inflow and outflow data, which limits their prediction accuracy. To address these issues, we propose CSP-AIT-Net, a novel spatiotemporal graph attention framework designed to enhance OD flow prediction by incorporating asynchronous inflow tracking and advanced station semantics representation. Our framework restructures the OD flow prediction paradigm by first predicting outflows and then decomposing OD flows using a spatiotemporal graph attention mechanism. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a masking mechanism and propose asynchronous passenger flow graphs that integrate inflow and OD flow with conservation constraints. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning to extract high-dimensional land use semantics of metro stations, enriching the contextual understanding of passenger mobility patterns. Validation of the Shanghai metro system demonstrates improvement in short-term OD flow prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes to enhancing metro operational efficiency, scheduling precision, and overall system safety.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, a novel paradigm has been proposed for reinforcement learning-based NAS agents, that revolves around the incremental improvement of a given architecture. We assess the abilities of such reinforcement learning agents to transfer between different tasks. We perform our evaluation using the Trans-NASBench-101 benchmark, and consider the efficacy of the transferred agents, as well as how quickly they can be trained. We find that pretraining an agent on one task benefits the performance of the agent in another task in all but 1 task when considering final performance. We also show that the training procedure for an agent can be shortened significantly by pretraining it on another task. Our results indicate that these effects occur regardless of the source or target task, although they are more pronounced for some tasks than for others. Our results show that transfer learning can be an effective tool in mitigating the computational cost of the initial training procedure for reinforcement learning-based NAS agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> RuiZhe Jiang, Haotian Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Over-parameterized neural networks often exhibit a notable gap in performance between the training and test sets, a phenomenon known as overfitting. To mitigate this, various regularization techniques have been proposed, each tailored to specific tasks and model architectures. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective on overfitting: models tend to learn different representations from distinct i.i.d. datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Sameloss}, an adaptive method that regularizes models by constraining the feature differences across random subsets of the same training set. Due to its minimal prior assumptions, this approach is broadly applicable across different architectures and tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that \textbf{Sameloss} effectively reduces overfitting with low sensitivity to hyperparameters and minimal computational cost. It exhibits particularly strong memory suppression and fosters normal convergence, even when the model is beginning to overfit. \textbf{Even in the absence of significant overfitting, our method consistently improves accuracy and lowers validation loss.}</p>

To this end, this paper proposes hyperbolic alternatives to the commonly used FGM and PGD adversarial attacks. Through interpretable synthetic benchmarks and experiments on existing datasets, we show how the existing and newly proposed attacks differ. Moreover, we investigate the differences in adversarial robustness between Euclidean and fully hyperbolic networks. We find that these networks suffer from different types of vulnerabilities and that the newly proposed hyperbolic attacks cannot address these differences. Therefore, we conclude that the shifts in adversarial robustness are due to the models learning distinct patterns resulting from their different geometries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomer Borreda, Daniel Freedman, Or Litany</p>
<p>Abstract: We present ReHub, a novel graph transformer architecture that achieves linear complexity through an efficient reassignment technique between nodes and virtual nodes. Graph transformers have become increasingly important in graph learning for their ability to utilize long-range node communication explicitly, addressing limitations such as oversmoothing and oversquashing found in message-passing graph networks. However, their dense attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of nodes, limiting their applicability to large-scale graphs. ReHub draws inspiration from the airline industry's hub-and-spoke model, where flights are assigned to optimize operational efficiency. In our approach, graph nodes (spokes) are dynamically reassigned to a fixed number of virtual nodes (hubs) at each model layer. Recent work, Neural Atoms (Li et al., 2024), has demonstrated impressive and consistent improvements over GNN baselines by utilizing such virtual nodes; their findings suggest that the number of hubs strongly influences performance. However, increasing the number of hubs typically raises complexity, requiring a trade-off to maintain linear complexity. Our key insight is that each node only needs to interact with a small subset of hubs to achieve linear complexity, even when the total number of hubs is large. To leverage all hubs without incurring additional computational costs, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive reassignment technique based on hub-hub similarity scores, eliminating the need for expensive node-hub computations. Our experiments on LRGB indicate a consistent improvement in results over the base method, Neural Atoms, while maintaining a linear complexity. Remarkably, our sparse model achieves performance on par with its non-sparse counterpart. Furthermore, ReHub outperforms competitive baselines and consistently ranks among top performers across various benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning as a service have become the status quo for many industries, leading to the widespread deployment of models that handle sensitive data. Well-performing models, the industry seeks, usually rely on a large volume of training data. However, the use of such data raises serious privacy concerns due to the potential risks of leaks of highly sensitive information. One prominent threat is the Membership Inference Attack, where adversaries attempt to deduce whether a specific data point was used in a model's training process. An adversary's ability to determine an individual's presence represents a significant privacy threat, especially when related to a group of users sharing sensitive information. Hence, well-designed privacy-preserving machine learning solutions are critically needed in the industry. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of L2 regularization and differential privacy in mitigating Membership Inference Attack risks. Even though regularization techniques like L2 regularization are commonly employed to reduce overfitting, a condition that enhances the effectiveness of Membership Inference Attacks, their impact on mitigating these attacks has not been systematically explored.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaolv Zeng, Yuan Tian, Guanjie Zheng, Yunjun Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) have primarily focused on capturing cross-time and cross-variate (channel) dependencies within historical data. However, a critical aspect often overlooked by many existing methods is the explicit incorporation of \textbf{time-related features} (e.g., season, month, day of the week, hour, minute), which are essential components of time series data. The absence of this explicit time-related encoding limits the ability of current models to capture cyclical or seasonal trends and long-term dependencies, especially with limited historical input. To address this gap, we introduce a simple yet highly efficient module designed to encode time-related features, Time Stamp Forecaster (TimeSter), thereby enhancing the backbone's forecasting performance. By integrating TimeSter with a linear backbone, our model, TimeLinear, significantly improves the performance of a single linear projector, reducing MSE by an average of 23\% on benchmark datasets such as Electricity and Traffic. Notably, TimeLinear achieves these gains while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency, delivering results that are on par with or exceed state-of-the-art models, despite using a fraction of the parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyuan Gao, Yusong Wang, Haoxiang Guan, Zun Wang, Qizhi Pei, John E. Hopcroft, Kun He, Lijun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of language models (LMs) to molecular structure generation using line notations such as SMILES and SELFIES has been well-established in the field of cheminformatics. However, extending these models to generate 3D molecular structures presents significant challenges. Two primary obstacles emerge: (1) the difficulty in designing a 3D line notation that ensures SE(3)-invariant atomic coordinates, and (2) the non-trivial task of tokenizing continuous coordinates for use in LMs, which inherently require discrete inputs. To address these challenges, we propose Mol-StrucTok, a novel method for tokenizing 3D molecular structures. Our approach comprises two key innovations: (1) We design a line notation for 3D molecules by extracting local atomic coordinates in a spherical coordinate system. This notation builds upon existing 2D line notations and remains agnostic to their specific forms, ensuring compatibility with various molecular representation schemes. (2) We employ a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to tokenize these coordinates, treating them as generation descriptors. To further enhance the representation, we incorporate neighborhood bond lengths and bond angles as understanding descriptors. Leveraging this tokenization framework, we train a GPT-2 style model for 3D molecular generation tasks. Results demonstrate strong performance with significantly faster generation speeds and competitive chemical stability compared to previous methods. Further, by integrating our learned discrete representations into Graphormer model for property prediction on QM9 dataset, Mol-StrucTok reveals consistent improvements across various molecular properties, underscoring the versatility and robustness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Peitz, Sedjro Salomon Hotegni</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneously considering multiple objectives in machine learning has been a popular approach for several decades, with various benefits for multi-task learning, the consideration of secondary goals such as sparsity, or multicriteria hyperparameter tuning. However - as multi-objective optimization is significantly more costly than single-objective optimization - the recent focus on deep learning architectures poses considerable additional challenges due to the very large number of parameters, strong nonlinearities and stochasticity. This survey covers recent advancements in the area of multi-objective deep learning. We introduce a taxonomy of existing methods - based on the type of training algorithm as well as the decision maker's needs - before listing recent advancements, and also successful applications. All three main learning paradigms supervised learning, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning are covered, and we also address the recently very popular area of generative modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Pablo Burgard, Jo\~ao Vitor Pamplona</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose FairML.jl, a Julia package providing a framework for fair classification in machine learning. In this framework, the fair learning process is divided into three stages. Each stage aims to reduce unfairness, such as disparate impact and disparate mistreatment, in the final prediction. For the preprocessing stage, we present a resampling method that addresses unfairness coming from data imbalances. The in-processing phase consist of a classification method. This can be either one coming from the MLJ.jl package, or a user defined one. For this phase, we incorporate fair ML methods that can handle unfairness to a certain degree through their optimization process. In the post-processing, we discuss the choice of the cut-off value for fair prediction. With simulations, we show the performance of the single phases and their combinations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kang Liu, Enrique Zuazua</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we address three non-convex optimization problems associated with the training of shallow neural networks (NNs) for exact and approximate representation, as well as for regression tasks. Through a mean-field approach, we convexify these problems and, applying a representer theorem, prove the absence of relaxation gaps. We establish generalization bounds for the resulting NN solutions, assessing their predictive performance on test datasets and, analyzing the impact of key hyperparameters on these bounds, propose optimal choices.
  On the computational side, we examine the discretization of the convexified problems and derive convergence rates. For low-dimensional datasets, these discretized problems are efficiently solvable using the simplex method. For high-dimensional datasets, we propose a sparsification algorithm that, combined with gradient descent for over-parameterized shallow NNs, yields effective solutions to the primal problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been becoming a popular interdisciplinary research area in both applied mathematics and information sciences. Mathematically, FL aims to collaboratively optimize aggregate objective functions over distributed datasets while satisfying a variety of privacy and system constraints.Different from conventional distributed optimization methods, FL needs to address several specific issues (e.g., non-i.i.d. data distributions and differential private noises), which pose a set of new challenges in the problem formulation, algorithm design, and convergence analysis. In this paper, we will systematically review existing FL optimization research including their assumptions, formulations, methods, and theoretical results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengnan Li, Haoxuan Li, Hao Wang, Jun Fang, Duoyin Li Yunxiao Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a crucial role in various domains, including web data analysis, energy consumption prediction, and weather forecasting. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are lightweight and effective for capturing temporal dependencies, they are prone to overfitting when used to model inter-channel dependencies. In this paper, we investigate the overfitting problem in channel-wise MLPs using Rademacher complexity theory, revealing that extreme values in time series data exacerbate this issue. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel Simplex-MLP layer, where the weights are constrained within a standard simplex. This strategy encourages the model to learn simpler patterns and thereby reducing overfitting to extreme values. Based on the Simplex-MLP layer, we propose a novel \textbf{F}requency \textbf{S}implex \textbf{MLP} (FSMLP) framework for time series forecasting, comprising of two kinds of modules: \textbf{S}implex \textbf{C}hannel-\textbf{W}ise MLP (SCWM) and \textbf{F}requency \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}LP (FTM). The SCWM effectively leverages the Simplex-MLP to capture inter-channel dependencies, while the FTM is a simple yet efficient temporal MLP designed to extract temporal information from the data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahindra Rautela, Alan Williams, Alexander Scheinker</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, such as particle accelerators, often require complicated and time-consuming tuning procedures for optimal performance. It may also be required that these procedures estimate the optimal system parameters, which govern the dynamics of a spatiotemporal beam -- this can be a high-dimensional optimization problem. To address this, we propose a Classifier-pruned Bayesian Optimization-based Latent space Tuner (CBOL-Tuner), a framework for efficient exploration within a temporally-structured latent space. The CBOL-Tuner integrates a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) for latent space representation, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for temporal dynamics, a dense neural network (DNN) for parameter estimation, and a classifier-pruned Bayesian optimizer (C-BO) to adaptively search and filter the latent space for optimal solutions. CBOL-Tuner demonstrates superior performance in identifying multiple optimal settings and outperforms alternative global optimization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor M. Tenorio, Madeline Navarro, Samuel Rey, Santiago Segarra, Antonio G. Marques</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising tool to handle data exhibiting an irregular structure. However, most GNN architectures perform well on homophilic datasets, where the labels of neighboring nodes are likely to be the same. In recent years, an increasing body of work has been devoted to the development of GNN architectures for heterophilic datasets, where labels do not exhibit this low-pass behavior. In this work, we create a new graph in which nodes are connected if they share structural characteristics, meaning a higher chance of sharing their labels, and then use this new graph in the GNN architecture. To do this, we compute the k-nearest neighbors graph according to distances between structural features, which are either (i) role-based, such as degree, or (ii) global, such as centrality measures. Experiments show that the labels are smoother in this newly defined graph and that the performance of GNN architectures improves when using this alternative structure.</p>

<p>Abstract: One significant challenge in research is to collect a large amount of data and learn the underlying relationship between the input and the output variables. This paper outlines the process of collecting and validating a dataset designed to determine the angle of arrival (AoA) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology. The data, collected in a laboratory setting, is intended to approximate real-world industrial scenarios. This paper discusses the data collection process, the structure of the dataset, and the methodology adopted for automating sample labeling for supervised learning. The collected samples and the process of generating ground truth (GT) labels were validated using the Texas Instruments (TI) phase difference of arrival (PDoA) implementation on the data, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) at one of the heights without obstacles of $25.71^\circ$. The distance estimation on BLE was implemented using a Gaussian Process Regression algorithm, yielding an MAE of $0.174$m.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisha Chen, AFM Saif, Yanning Shen, Tianyi Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding specific preference-guided Pareto solutions that represent different trade-offs among multiple objectives is critical yet challenging in multi-objective problems. Existing methods are restrictive in preference definitions and/or their theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce a Flexible framEwork for pREfeRence-guided multi-Objective learning (FERERO) by casting it as a constrained vector optimization problem. Specifically, two types of preferences are incorporated into this formulation -- the relative preference defined by the partial ordering induced by a polyhedral cone, and the absolute preference defined by constraints that are linear functions of the objectives. To solve this problem, convergent algorithms are developed with both single-loop and stochastic variants. Notably, this is the first single-loop primal algorithm for constrained vector optimization to our knowledge. The proposed algorithms adaptively adjust to both constraint and objective values, eliminating the need to solve different subproblems at different stages of constraint satisfaction. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method is very competitive in finding preference-guided optimal solutions. Code is available at https://github.com/lisha-chen/FERERO/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoran Cheng, Boran Han, Danielle C. Maddix, Abdul Fatir Ansari, Andrew Stuart, Michael W. Mahoney, Yuyang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models that satisfy hard constraints are crucial in many scientific and engineering applications where physical laws or system requirements must be strictly respected. However, many existing constrained generative models, especially those developed for computer vision, rely heavily on gradient information, often sparse or computationally expensive in fields like partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we introduce a novel framework for adapting pre-trained, unconstrained flow-matching models to satisfy constraints exactly in a zero-shot manner without requiring expensive gradient computations or fine-tuning. Our framework, ECI sampling, alternates between extrapolation (E), correction (C), and interpolation (I) stages during each iterative sampling step of flow matching sampling to ensure accurate integration of constraint information while preserving the validity of the generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various PDE systems, showing that ECI-guided generation strictly adheres to physical constraints and accurately captures complex distribution shifts induced by these constraints. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baseline approaches in various zero-shot constrained generation tasks and also achieves competitive results in the regression tasks without additional fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhang, Min-Te Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Spectral Graph Convolutional Networks (SpecGCNs) have led to state-of-the-art performance in various graph representation learning tasks. To exploit the potential of SpecGCNs, we analyze corresponding graph filters via polynomial interpolation, the cornerstone of graph signal processing. Different polynomial bases, such as Bernstein, Chebyshev, and monomial basis, have various convergence rates that will affect the error in polynomial interpolation. Although adopting Chebyshev basis for interpolation can minimize maximum error, the performance of ChebNet is still weaker than GPR-GNN and BernNet. \textbf{We point out it is caused by the Gibbs phenomenon, which occurs when the graph frequency response function approximates the target function.} It reduces the approximation ability of a truncated polynomial interpolation. In order to mitigate the Gibbs phenomenon, we propose to add the Gibbs damping factor with each term of Chebyshev polynomials on ChebNet. As a result, our lightweight approach leads to a significant performance boost. Afterwards, we reorganize ChebNet via decoupling feature propagation and transformation. We name this variant as \textbf{ChebGibbsNet}. Our experiments indicate that ChebGibbsNet is superior to other advanced SpecGCNs, such as GPR-GNN and BernNet, in both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matin Mortaheb, Mohammad A. Amir Khojastepour, Sennur Ulukus</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers, known for their attention mechanisms, have proven highly effective in focusing on critical elements within complex data. This feature can effectively be used to address the time-varying channels in wireless communication systems. In this work, we introduce a channel-aware adaptive framework for semantic communication, where different regions of the image are encoded and compressed based on their semantic content. By employing vision transformers, we interpret the attention mask as a measure of the semantic contents of the patches and dynamically categorize the patches to be compressed at various rates as a function of the instantaneous channel bandwidth. Our method enhances communication efficiency by adapting the encoding resolution to the content's relevance, ensuring that even in highly constrained environments, critical information is preserved. We evaluate the proposed adaptive transmission framework using the TinyImageNet dataset, measuring both reconstruction quality and accuracy. The results demonstrate that our approach maintains high semantic fidelity while optimizing bandwidth, providing an effective solution for transmitting multi-resolution data in limited bandwidth conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> J. S. Muthmaina</p>
<p>Abstract: This study addresses the persistent challenges of Workplace Gender Equality (WGE) in Indonesia, examining regional disparities in gender empowerment and inequality through the Gender Empowerment Index (IDG) and Gender Inequality Index (IKG). Despite Indonesia's economic growth and incremental progress in gender equality, as indicated by improvements in the IDG and IKG scores from 2018 to 2023, substantial regional differences remain. Utilizing k-means clustering, the study identifies two distinct clusters of regions with contrasting gender profiles. Cluster 0 includes regions like DKI Jakarta and Central Java, characterized by higher gender empowerment and lower inequality, while Cluster 1 comprises areas such as Papua and North Maluku, where gender disparities are more pronounced. The analysis reveals that local socio-economic conditions and governance frameworks play a critical role in shaping regional gender dynamics. Correlation analyses further demonstrate that higher empowerment is generally associated with lower inequality and greater female representation in professional roles. These findings underscore the importance of targeted, region-specific interventions to promote WGE, addressing both structural and cultural barriers. The insights provided by this study aim to guide policymakers in developing tailored strategies to foster gender equality and enhance women's participation in the workforce across Indonesia's diverse regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhuo, Zemin Liu, Bryan Hooi, Bingsheng He, Guang Tan, Rizal Fathony, Jia Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Label imbalance and homophily-heterophily mixture are the fundamental problems encountered when applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) tasks. Existing GNN-based GFD models are designed to augment graph structure to accommodate the inductive bias of GNNs towards homophily, by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. In our work, we argue that the key to applying GNNs for GFD is not to exclude but to {\em distinguish} neighbors with different labels. Grounded in this perspective, we introduce Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), an intuitive yet effective message passing paradigm expressly crafted for GFD. Specifically, in the neighbor aggregation stage of PMP, neighbors with different classes are aggregated with distinct node-specific aggregation functions. By this means, the center node can adaptively adjust the information aggregated from its heterophilic and homophilic neighbors, thus avoiding the model gradient being dominated by benign nodes which occupy the majority of the population. We theoretically establish a connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and spectral analysis to characterize that PMP operates an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter, which demonstrates the capability of PMP to handle heterophily-homophily mixed graphs. Extensive experimental results show that PMP can significantly boost the performance on GFD tasks.</p>

It can be found that the proposed solution is better than the existing feature extraction technique with improvement to the classification accuracy by 30% to 37%.

<p>Abstract: Waterways shape earth system processes and human societies, and a better understanding of their distribution can assist in a range of applications from earth system modeling to human development and disaster response. Most efforts to date to map the world's waterways have required extensive modeling and contextual expert input, and are costly to repeat. Many gaps remain, particularly in geographies with lower economic development. Here we present a computer vision model that can draw waterways based on 10m Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and the 30m GLO-30 Copernicus digital elevation model, trained using high fidelity waterways data from the United States. We couple this model with a vectorization process to map waterways worldwide. For widespread utility and downstream modelling efforts, we scaffold this new data on the backbone of existing mapped basins and waterways from another dataset, TDX-Hydro. In total, we add 124 million kilometers of waterways to the 54 million kilometers already in the TDX-Hydro dataset, more than tripling the extent of waterways mapped globally.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhan Zhang, Benjamin Zi Hao Zhao, Hassan Asghar, Dali Kaafar</p>
<p>Abstract: Users may inadvertently upload personally identifiable information (PII) to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) providers. When users no longer want their PII on these services, regulations like GDPR and COPPA mandate a right to forget for these users. As such, these services seek efficient methods to remove the influence of specific data points. Thus the introduction of machine unlearning. Traditionally, unlearning is performed with the removal of entire data samples (sample unlearning) or whole features across the dataset (feature unlearning). However, these approaches are not equipped to handle the more granular and challenging task of unlearning specific objects within a sample. To address this gap, we propose a scene graph-based object unlearning framework. This framework utilizes scene graphs, rich in semantic representation, transparently translate unlearning requests into actionable steps. The result, is the preservation of the overall semantic integrity of the generated image, bar the unlearned object. Further, we manage high computational overheads with influence functions to approximate the unlearning process. For validation, we evaluate the unlearned object's fidelity in outputs under the tasks of image reconstruction and image synthesis. Our proposed framework demonstrates improved object unlearning outcomes, with the preservation of unrequested samples in contrast to sample and feature learning methods. This work addresses critical privacy issues by increasing the granularity of targeted machine unlearning through forgetting specific object-level details without sacrificing the utility of the whole data sample or dataset feature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by the scarcity of proper labels in an astrophysical application, we have developed a novel technique, called Selfish Evolution, which allows for the detection and correction of corrupted labels in a weakly supervised fashion. Unlike methods based on early stopping, we let the model train on the noisy dataset. Only then do we intervene and allow the model to overfit to individual samples. The ``evolution'' of the model during this process reveals patterns with enough information about the noisiness of the label, as well as its correct version. We train a secondary network on these spatiotemporal ``evolution cubes'' to correct potentially corrupted labels. We incorporate the technique in a closed-loop fashion, allowing for automatic convergence towards a mostly clean dataset, without presumptions about the state of the network in which we intervene. We evaluate on the main task of the Supernova-hunting dataset but also demonstrate efficiency on the more standard MNIST dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of teaching a robot manipulator to perform dynamic non-prehensile object transport, also known as the `robot waiter' task, from a limited set of real-world demonstrations. We propose an approach that combines batch reinforcement learning (RL) with model-predictive control (MPC) by pretraining an ensemble of value functions from demonstration data, and utilizing them online within an uncertainty-aware MPC scheme to ensure robustness to limited data coverage. Our approach is straightforward to integrate with off-the-shelf MPC frameworks and enables learning solely from task space demonstrations with sparsely labeled transitions, while leveraging MPC to ensure smooth joint space motions and constraint satisfaction. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulated and real-world experiments on a Franka Panda robot performing the robot waiter task and demonstrate robust deployment of value functions learned from 50-100 demonstrations. Furthermore, our approach enables generalization to novel objects not seen during training and can improve upon suboptimal demonstrations. We believe that such a framework can reduce the burden of providing extensive demonstrations and facilitate rapid training of robot manipulators to perform non-prehensile manipulation tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Waheed Rehman</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of steganography has long been focused on developing methods to securely embed information within various digital media while ensuring imperceptibility and robustness. However, the growing sophistication of detection tools and the demand for increased data hiding capacity have revealed limitations in traditional techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image steganography that leverages the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to address these challenges. By employing a carefully designed GAN architecture, our method ensures the creation of stego-images that are visually indistinguishable from their original counterparts, effectively thwarting detection by advanced steganalysis tools. Additionally, the adversarial training paradigm optimizes the balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robustness, enabling more efficient and secure data hiding. We evaluate our proposed method through a series of experiments on benchmark datasets and compare its performance against baseline techniques, including least significant bit (LSB) substitution and discrete cosine transform (DCT)-based methods. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and robustness against detection. This work not only contributes to the advancement of image steganography but also provides a foundation for exploring GAN-based approaches for secure digital communication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in photorealism, image editing, and solving inverse problems, aided by classifier-free guidance and image inversion techniques. However, rectified flow models (RFMs) remain underexplored for these tasks. Existing DM-based methods often require additional training, lack generalization to pretrained latent models, underperform, and demand significant computational resources due to extensive backpropagation through ODE solvers and inversion processes. In this work, we first develop a theoretical and empirical understanding of the vector field dynamics of RFMs in efficiently guiding the denoising trajectory. Our findings reveal that we can navigate the vector field in a deterministic and gradient-free manner. Utilizing this property, we propose FlowChef, which leverages the vector field to steer the denoising trajectory for controlled image generation tasks, facilitated by gradient skipping. FlowChef is a unified framework for controlled image generation that, for the first time, simultaneously addresses classifier guidance, linear inverse problems, and image editing without the need for extra training, inversion, or intensive backpropagation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations and show that FlowChef significantly outperforms baselines in terms of performance, memory, and time requirements, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram, Swetha Karthikeyan,  Bhavya, Suma Bhat</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to process multi-modal data, providing enhanced contextual understanding of complex problems. MLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA); however, they often struggle with fundamental engineering problems, and there is a scarcity of specialized datasets for training on topics like digital electronics. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark dataset called ElectroVizQA specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' performance on digital electronic circuit problems commonly found in undergraduate curricula. This dataset, the first of its kind tailored for the VQA task in digital electronics, comprises approximately 626 visual questions, offering a comprehensive overview of digital electronics topics. This paper rigorously assesses the extent to which MLLMs can understand and solve digital electronic circuit questions, providing insights into their capabilities and limitations within this specialized domain. By introducing this benchmark dataset, we aim to motivate further research and development in the application of MLLMs to engineering education, ultimately bridging the performance gap and enhancing the efficacy of these models in technical fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angus Fung, Aaron Hao Tan, Haitong Wang, Beno Benhabib, Goldie Nejat</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic search of people in human-centered environments, including healthcare settings, is challenging as autonomous robots need to locate people without complete or any prior knowledge of their schedules, plans or locations. Furthermore, robots need to be able to adapt to real-time events that can influence a person's plan in an environment. In this paper, we present MLLM-Search, a novel zero-shot person search architecture that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLM) to address the mobile robot problem of searching for a person under event-driven scenarios with varying user schedules. Our approach introduces a novel visual prompting method to provide robots with spatial understanding of the environment by generating a spatially grounded waypoint map, representing navigable waypoints by a topological graph and regions by semantic labels. This is incorporated into a MLLM with a region planner that selects the next search region based on the semantic relevance to the search scenario, and a waypoint planner which generates a search path by considering the semantically relevant objects and the local spatial context through our unique spatial chain-of-thought prompting approach. Extensive 3D photorealistic experiments were conducted to validate the performance of MLLM-Search in searching for a person with a changing schedule in different environments. An ablation study was also conducted to validate the main design choices of MLLM-Search. Furthermore, a comparison study with state-of-the art search methods demonstrated that MLLM-Search outperforms existing methods with respect to search efficiency. Real-world experiments with a mobile robot in a multi-room floor of a building showed that MLLM-Search was able to generalize to finding a person in a new unseen environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyao Zheng, Michael A. Jacobs, Vishwa S. Parekh</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised foundation models have recently been successfully extended to encode three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images, with excellent performance across several downstream tasks, such as intracranial hemorrhage detection and lung cancer risk forecasting. However, as self-supervised models learn from complex data distributions, questions arise concerning whether these embeddings capture demographic information, such as age, sex, or race. Using the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, which contains 3D CT images and demographic data, we evaluated a range of classifiers: softmax regression, linear regression, linear support vector machine, random forest, and decision tree, to predict sex, race, and age of the patients in the images. Our results indicate that the embeddings effectively encoded age and sex information, with a linear regression model achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.8 years for age prediction and a softmax regression model attaining an AUC of 0.998 for sex classification. Race prediction was less effective, with an AUC of 0.878. These findings suggest a detailed exploration into the information encoded in self-supervised learning frameworks is needed to help ensure fair, responsible, and patient privacy-protected healthcare AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Friedhelm Hamann, Daniel Gehrig, Filbert Febryanto, Kostas Daniilidis, Guillermo Gallego</p>
<p>Abstract: Tracking any point (TAP) recently shifted the motion estimation paradigm from focusing on individual salient points with local templates to tracking arbitrary points with global image contexts. However, while research has mostly focused on driving the accuracy of models in nominal settings, addressing scenarios with difficult lighting conditions and high-speed motions remains out of reach due to the limitations of the sensor. This work addresses this challenge with the first event camera-based TAP method. It leverages the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras for robust high-speed tracking, and the global contexts in TAP methods to handle asynchronous and sparse event measurements. We further extend the TAP framework to handle event feature variations induced by motion - thereby addressing an open challenge in purely event-based tracking - with a novel feature alignment loss which ensures the learning of motion-robust features. Our method is trained with data from a new data generation pipeline and systematically ablated across all design decisions. Our method shows strong cross-dataset generalization and performs 135% better on the average Jaccard metric than the baselines. Moreover, on an established feature tracking benchmark, it achieves a 19% improvement over the previous best event-only method and even surpasses the previous best events-and-frames method by 3.7%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Shi, Yiren Song, Dengming Zhang, Jiaming Liu, Xingxing Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual text images are prevalent in various applications, requiring careful font selection and typographic choices. Recent advances in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based text-to-image (T2I) models show promise in automating these processes. However, these methods still face challenges such as inconsistent fonts, style variation, and limited fine-grained control, particularly at the word level. This paper proposes a two-stage DiT-based pipeline to address these issues by enhancing controllability over typography and style in text rendering. We introduce Typography Control (TC) finetuning, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, and enclosing typography control tokens (ETC-tokens), which enable precise word-level application of typographic features. To further enhance style control, we present a Style Control Adapter (SCA) that injects style information through image inputs independent of text prompts. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior word-level typographic control, font consistency, and style consistency in Basic and Artistic Text Rendering (BTR and ATR) tasks. Our results mark a significant advancement in the precision and adaptability of T2I models, presenting new possibilities for creative applications and design-oriented tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihang Li, Siqi Tan, Bowen Chang, Jing Zhang, Chen Feng, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual localization, which estimates a camera's pose within a known scene, is a long-standing challenge in vision and robotics. Recent end-to-end methods that directly regress camera poses from query images have gained attention for fast inference. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize to unseen views. In this work, we aim to unleash the power of data synthesis to promote the generalizability of pose regression. Specifically, we lift real 2D images into 3D Gaussian Splats with varying appearance and deblurring abilities, which are then used as a data engine to synthesize more posed images. To fully leverage the synthetic data, we build a two-branch joint training pipeline, with an adversarial discriminator to bridge the syn-to-real gap. Experiments on established benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end approaches, reducing translation and rotation errors by 50% and 21.6% on indoor datasets, and 35.56% and 38.7% on outdoor datasets. We also validate the effectiveness of our method in dynamic driving scenarios under varying weather conditions. Notably, as data synthesis scales up, our method exhibits a growing ability to interpolate and extrapolate training data for localizing unseen views. Project Page: https://ai4ce.github.io/RAP/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rocco Manz Maruzzelli, Basile Lewandowski, Lydia Y. Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) generate remarkable high quality images via the stochastic denoising process, which unfortunately incurs high sampling time. Post-quantizing the trained diffusion models in fixed bit-widths, e.g., 4 bits on weights and 8 bits on activation, is shown effective in accelerating sampling time while maintaining the image quality. Motivated by the observation that the cross-layer dependency of DMs vary across layers and sampling steps, we propose a mixed precision quantization scheme, MPQ-Diff, which allocates different bit-width to the weights and activation of the layers. We advocate to use the cross-layer correlation of a given layer, termed network orthogonality metric, as a proxy to measure the relative importance of a layer per sampling step. We further adopt a uniform sampling scheme to avoid the excessive profiling overhead of estimating orthogonality across all time steps. We evaluate the proposed mixed-precision on LSUN and ImageNet, showing a significant improvement in FID from 65.73 to 15.39, and 52.66 to 14.93, compared to their fixed precision quantization, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emily Liu, Michael Noseworthy, Nicholas Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: The scarcity of labeled action data poses a considerable challenge for developing machine learning algorithms for robotic object manipulation. It is expensive and often infeasible for a robot to interact with many objects. Conversely, visual data of objects, without interaction, is abundantly available and can be leveraged for pretraining and feature extraction. However, current methods that rely on image data for pretraining do not easily adapt to task-specific predictions, since the learned features are not guaranteed to be relevant. This paper introduces the Semi-Supervised Neural Process (SSNP): an adaptive reward-prediction model designed for scenarios in which only a small subset of objects have labeled interaction data. In addition to predicting reward labels, the latent-space of the SSNP is jointly trained with an autoencoding objective using passive data from a much larger set of objects. Jointly training with both types of data allows the model to focus more effectively on generalizable features and minimizes the need for extensive retraining, thereby reducing computational demands. The efficacy of SSNP is demonstrated through a door-opening task, leading to better performance than other semi-supervised methods, and only using a fraction of the data compared to other adaptive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quentin Houbre, Roel Pieters</p>
<p>Abstract: The autonomous learning of new goals in robotics remains a complex issue to address. Here, we propose a model where curiosity influence learning flexibility. To do so, this paper proposes to root curiosity and attention together by taking inspiration from the Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine system along with various cognitive processes such as cognitive persistence and visual habituation. We apply our approach by experimenting with a simulated robotic arm on a set of objects with varying difficulty. The robot first discovers new goals via bottom-up attention through motor babbling with an inhibition of return mechanism, then engage to the learning of goals due to neural activity arising within the curiosity mechanism. The architecture is modelled with dynamic neural fields and the learning of goals such as pushing the objects in diverse directions is supported by the use of forward and inverse models implemented by multi-layer perceptrons. The adoption of dynamic neural fields to model curiosity, habituation and persistence allows the robot to demonstrate various learning trajectories depending on the object. In addition, the approach exhibits interesting properties regarding the learning of similar goals as well as the continuous switch between exploration and exploitation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kunyang Han, Yibo Hu, Mengxue Qu, Hailin Shi, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled open-vocabulary and free-text segmentation, yet existing models still require predefined category prompts, limiting free-form category self-generation. Most segmentation LMMs also remain confined to sparse predictions, restricting their applicability in open-set environments. In contrast, we propose ROSE, a Revolutionary Open-set dense SEgmentation LMM, which enables dense mask prediction and open-category generation through patch-wise perception. Our method treats each image patch as an independent region of interest candidate, enabling the model to predict both dense and sparse masks simultaneously. Additionally, a newly designed instruction-response paradigm takes full advantage of the generation and generalization capabilities of LMMs, achieving category prediction independent of closed-set constraints or predefined categories. To further enhance mask detail and category precision, we introduce a conversation-based refinement paradigm, integrating the prediction result from previous step with textual prompt for revision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROSE achieves competitive performance across various segmentation tasks in a unified framework. Code will be released.</p>

We also propose a simple and effective strategy to track objects in the input video forward and backward in time. Our results show an improvement over the current state of the art in existing sparsely captured datasets and significant improvements in a newly proposed densely captured (video) dataset.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present batch-consistent inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement frame. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 2.5 minutes on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.

<p>Abstract: High-quality 3D urban reconstruction is essential for applications in urban planning, navigation, and AR/VR. However, capturing detailed ground-level data across cities is both labor-intensive and raises significant privacy concerns related to sensitive information, such as vehicle plates, faces, and other personal identifiers. To address these challenges, we propose AerialGo, a novel framework that generates realistic walking-through city views from aerial images, leveraging multi-view diffusion models to achieve scalable, photorealistic urban reconstructions without direct ground-level data collection. By conditioning ground-view synthesis on accessible aerial data, AerialGo bypasses the privacy risks inherent in ground-level imagery. To support the model training, we introduce AerialGo dataset, a large-scale dataset containing diverse aerial and ground-view images, paired with camera and depth information, designed to support generative urban reconstruction. Experiments show that AerialGo significantly enhances ground-level realism and structural coherence, providing a privacy-conscious, scalable solution for city-scale 3D modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiyi Qiu, Minghe Gao, Long Qian, Kaihang Pan, Qifan Yu, Juncheng Li, Wenjie Wang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Chen, Ruiguo Zhong, Kehua Chen, Zhiwei Shang, Meixin Zhu, Edward Chung</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety in such complex scenarios. Existing approaches often struggle to provide reliable safety mechanisms in dynamic and learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in signal-free intersections. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task driving in signal-free intersections. Our approach incorporates a goal-oriented, task-guided diffusion model, enabling the model to learn multiple driving tasks simultaneously from real-world data. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Performance evaluations across various scenes confirm that DSC-Diffuser provides realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, equipping it with the flexibility to adapt to diverse driving tasks.</p>

Specifically, SOLAMI builds 3D autonomous characters from three aspects: (1) Social VLA Architecture: We propose a unified social VLA framework to generate multimodal response (speech and motion) based on the user's multimodal input to drive the character for social interaction. (2) Interactive Multimodal Data: We present SynMSI, a synthetic multimodal social interaction dataset generated by an automatic pipeline using only existing motion datasets to address the issue of data scarcity. (3) Immersive VR Interface: We develop a VR interface that enables users to immersively interact with these characters driven by various architectures. Extensive quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that our framework leads to more precise and natural character responses (in both speech and motion) that align with user expectations with lower latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyan Xing, Konrad Groh, Sezer Karagolu, Theo Gevers, Anand Bhattad</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LumiNet, a novel architecture that leverages generative models and latent intrinsic representations for effective lighting transfer. Given a source image and a target lighting image, LumiNet synthesizes a relit version of the source scene that captures the target's lighting. Our approach makes two key contributions: a data curation strategy from the StyleGAN-based relighting model for our training, and a modified diffusion-based ControlNet that processes both latent intrinsic properties from the source image and latent extrinsic properties from the target image. We further improve lighting transfer through a learned adaptor (MLP) that injects the target's latent extrinsic properties via cross-attention and fine-tuning.
  Unlike traditional ControlNet, which generates images with conditional maps from a single scene, LumiNet processes latent representations from two different images - preserving geometry and albedo from the source while transferring lighting characteristics from the target. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully transfers complex lighting phenomena including specular highlights and indirect illumination across scenes with varying spatial layouts and materials, outperforming existing approaches on challenging indoor scenes using only images as input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Bulgarelli, Elia Cellini, Alessandro Nada</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele De Vita, Vasileios Belagiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in generative modelling, current diffusion models lack a quantitative approach to assess image quality. To address this limitation, we propose to estimate the pixel-wise aleatoric uncertainty during the sampling phase of diffusion models and utilise the uncertainty to improve the sample generation quality. The uncertainty is computed as the variance of the denoising scores with a perturbation scheme that is specifically designed for diffusion models. We then show that the aleatoric uncertainty estimates are related to the second-order derivative of the diffusion noise distribution. We evaluate our uncertainty estimation algorithm and the uncertainty-guided sampling on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. In our comparisons with the related work, we demonstrate promising results in filtering out low quality samples. Furthermore, we show that our guided approach leads to better sample generation in terms of FID scores.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivory Yang, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi</p>
<p>Abstract: The preservation and revitalization of endangered and extinct languages is a meaningful endeavor, conserving cultural heritage while enriching fields like linguistics and anthropology. However, these languages are typically low-resource, making their reconstruction labor-intensive and costly. This challenge is exemplified by N\"ushu, a rare script historically used by Yao women in China for self-expression within a patriarchal society. To address this challenge, we introduce N\"ushuRescue, an AI-driven framework designed to train large language models (LLMs) on endangered languages with minimal data. N\"ushuRescue automates evaluation and expands target corpora to accelerate linguistic revitalization. As a foundational component, we developed NCGold, a 500-sentence N\"ushu-Chinese parallel corpus, the first publicly available dataset of its kind. Leveraging GPT-4-Turbo, with no prior exposure to N\"ushu and only 35 short examples from NCGold, N\"ushuRescue achieved 48.69\% translation accuracy on 50 withheld sentences and generated NCSilver, a set of 98 newly translated modern Chinese sentences of varying lengths. A sample of both NCGold and NCSilver is included in the Supplementary Materials. Additionally, we developed FastText-based and Seq2Seq models to further support research on N\"ushu. N\"ushuRescue provides a versatile and scalable tool for the revitalization of endangered languages, minimizing the need for extensive human input.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianqi Shang, Weiqing He, Tianlong Chen, Ying Ding, Huanmei Wu, Kaixiong Zhou, Li Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a crucial role in patient health outcomes, yet their integration into biomedical knowledge graphs remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by constructing an SDoH-enriched knowledge graph using the MIMIC-III dataset and PrimeKG. We introduce a novel fairness formulation for graph embeddings, focusing on invariance with respect to sensitive SDoH information. Via employing a heterogeneous-GCN model for drug-disease link prediction, we detect biases related to various SDoH factors. To mitigate these biases, we propose a post-processing method that strategically reweights edges connected to SDoHs, balancing their influence on graph representations. This approach represents one of the first comprehensive investigations into fairness issues within biomedical knowledge graphs incorporating SDoH. Our work not only highlights the importance of considering SDoH in medical informatics but also provides a concrete method for reducing SDoH-related biases in link prediction tasks, paving the way for more equitable healthcare recommendations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advances in learning-based behavioral planning for autonomous systems, decision-making in multi-task missions remains a challenging problem. For instance, a mission might require a robot to explore an unknown environment, locate the goals, and navigate to them, even if there are obstacles along the way. Such problems are difficult to solve due to: a) sparse rewards, meaning a reward signal is available only once all the tasks in a mission have been satisfied, and b) the agent having to perform tasks at run-time that are not covered in the training data, e.g., demonstrations only from an environment where all doors were unlocked. Consequently, state-of-the-art decision-making methods in such settings are limited to missions where the required tasks are well-represented in the training demonstrations and can be solved within a short planning horizon. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptformer, a stochastic and adaptive planner that utilizes sequence models for sample-efficient exploration and exploitation. This framework relies on learning an energy-based heuristic, which needs to be minimized over a sequence of high-level decisions. To generate successful action sequences for long-horizon missions, Adaptformer aims to achieve shorter sub-goals, which are proposed through an intrinsic sub-goal curriculum. Through these two key components, Adaptformer allows for generalization to out-of-distribution tasks and environments, i.e., missions that were not a part of the training data. Empirical results in multiple simulation environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, Adaptformer not only outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to 25% in multi-goal maze reachability tasks but also successfully adapts to multi-task missions that the state-of-the-art method could not complete, leveraging demonstrations from single-goal-reaching tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daomin Ji, Hui Luo, Zhifeng Bao, Shane Culpepper</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenge of integrating tables from data lakes, focusing on three core tasks: 1) pairwise integrability judgment, which determines whether a tuple pair in a table is integrable, accounting for any occurrences of semantic equivalence or typographical errors; 2) integrable set discovery, which aims to identify all integrable sets in a table based on pairwise integrability judgments established in the first task; 3) multi-tuple conflict resolution, which resolves conflicts among multiple tuples during integration. We train a binary classifier to address the task of pairwise integrability judgment. Given the scarcity of labeled data, we propose a self-supervised adversarial contrastive learning algorithm to perform classification, which incorporates data augmentation methods and adversarial examples to autonomously generate new training data. Upon the output of pairwise integrability judgment, each integrable set is considered as a community, a densely connected sub-graph where nodes and edges correspond to tuples in the table and their pairwise integrability, respectively. We proceed to investigate various community detection algorithms to address the integrable set discovery objective. Moving forward to tackle multi-tuple conflict resolution, we introduce an novel in-context learning methodology. This approach capitalizes on the knowledge embedded within pretrained large language models to effectively resolve conflicts that arise when integrating multiple tuples. Notably, our method minimizes the need for annotated data. Since no suitable test collections are available for our tasks, we develop our own benchmarks using two real-word dataset repositories: Real and Join. We conduct extensive experiments on these benchmarks to validate the robustness and applicability of our methodologies in the context of integrating tables within data lakes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Corlay, Tatsuya Nakazato, Kanako Yamaguchi, Akinori Nakajima</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of deep learning and recurrent neural networks revolutionized the field of time-series processing. Therefore, recent research on spectrum prediction has focused on the use of these tools. However, spectrum prediction, which involves forecasting wireless spectrum availability, is an older field where many "classical" tools were considered around the 2010s, such as Markov models. This work revisits high-order Markov models for spectrum prediction in dynamic wireless environments. We introduce a framework to address mismatches between sensing length and model order as well as state-space complexity arising with large order. Furthermore, we extend this Markov framework by enabling fine-tuning of the probability transition matrix through gradient-based supervised learning, offering a hybrid approach that bridges probabilistic modeling and modern machine learning. Simulations on real-world Wi-Fi traffic demonstrate the competitive performance of high-order Markov models compared to deep learning methods, particularly in scenarios with constrained datasets containing outliers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jackson Kulik, Keith A. LeGrand</p>
<p>Abstract: Many problems in navigation and tracking require increasingly accurate characterizations of the evolution of uncertainty in nonlinear systems. Nonlinear uncertainty propagation approaches based on Gaussian mixture density approximations offer distinct advantages over sampling based methods in their computational cost and continuous representation. State-of-the-art Gaussian mixture approaches are adaptive in that individual Gaussian mixands are selectively split into mixtures to yield better approximations of the true propagated distribution. Despite the importance of the splitting process to accuracy and computational efficiency, relatively little work has been devoted to mixand selection and splitting direction optimization. The first part of this work presents splitting methods that preserve the mean and covariance of the original distribution. Then, we present and compare a number of novel heuristics for selecting the splitting direction. The choice of splitting direction is informed by the initial uncertainty distribution, properties of the nonlinear function through which the original distribution is propagated, and a whitening based natural scaling method to avoid dependence of the splitting direction on the scaling of coordinates. We compare these novel heuristics to existing techniques in three distinct examples involving Cartesian to polar coordinate transformation, Keplerian orbital element propagation, and uncertainty propagation in the circular restricted three-body problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takayuki Osogami, Hirota Kinoshita, Segev Wasserkrug</p>
<p>Abstract: A popular approach of automated mechanism design is to formulate a linear program (LP) whose solution gives a mechanism with desired properties. We analytically derive a class of optimal solutions for such an LP that gives mechanisms achieving standard properties of efficiency, incentive compatibility, strong budget balance (SBB), and individual rationality (IR), where SBB and IR are satisfied in expectation. Notably, our solutions are represented by an exponentially smaller number of essential variables than the original variables of LP. Our solutions, however, involve a term whose exact evaluation requires solving a certain optimization problem exponentially many times as the number of players, $N$, grows. We thus evaluate this term by modeling it as the problem of estimating the mean reward of the best arm in multi-armed bandit (MAB), propose a Probably and Approximately Correct estimator, and prove its asymptotic optimality by establishing a lower bound on its sample complexity. This MAB approach reduces the number of times the optimization problem is solved from exponential to $O(N\,\log N)$. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach finds mechanisms that are guaranteed to achieve desired properties with high probability for environments with up to 128 players, which substantially improves upon the prior work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huadong Tang, Youpeng Zhao, Yan Huang, Min Xu, Jun Wang, Qiang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: It is widely agreed that open-vocabulary-based approaches outperform classical closed-set training solutions for recognizing unseen objects in images for semantic segmentation. Existing open-vocabulary approaches leverage vision-language models, such as CLIP, to align visual features with rich semantic features acquired through pre-training on large-scale vision-language datasets. However, the text prompts employed in these methods are short phrases based on fixed templates, failing to capture comprehensive object attributes. Moreover, while the CLIP model excels at exploiting image-level features, it is less effective at pixel-level representation, which is crucial for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above-mentioned issues by leveraging multiple large-scale models to enhance the alignment between fine-grained visual features and enriched linguistic features. Specifically, our method employs large language models (LLMs) to generate enriched language prompts with diverse visual attributes for each category, including color, shape/size, and texture/material. Additionally, for enhanced visual feature extraction, the SAM model is adopted as a supplement to the CLIP visual encoder through a proposed learnable weighted fusion strategy. Built upon these techniques, our method, termed LMSeg, achieves state-of-the-art performance across all major open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. The code will be made available soon.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities across a variety of tasks. Fine-tuning these models for specific domains, particularly through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies like LoRA, has become a prevalent practice due to its efficiency. However, this raises significant privacy and security concerns, as models may inadvertently retain and disseminate sensitive or undesirable information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel instance-wise unlearning framework, LLMEraser, which systematically categorizes unlearning tasks and applies precise parameter adjustments using influence functions. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that are often limited in scope and require extensive retraining, LLMEraser is designed to handle a broad spectrum of unlearning tasks without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LLMEraser excels in efficiently managing various unlearning scenarios while maintaining the overall integrity and efficacy of the models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots have significant gaps in their sensing and perception, making it hard to perform motion planning in dense environments. To address this, we introduce ARMOR, a novel egocentric perception system that integrates both hardware and software, specifically incorporating wearable-like depth sensors for humanoid robots. Our distributed perception approach enhances the robot's spatial awareness, and facilitates more agile motion planning. We also train a transformer-based imitation learning (IL) policy in simulation to perform dynamic collision avoidance, by leveraging around 86 hours worth of human realistic motions from the AMASS dataset. We show that our ARMOR perception is superior against a setup with multiple dense head-mounted, and externally mounted depth cameras, with a 63.7% reduction in collisions, and 78.7% improvement on success rate. We also compare our IL policy against a sampling-based motion planning expert cuRobo, showing 31.6% less collisions, 16.9% higher success rate, and 26x reduction in computational latency. Lastly, we deploy our ARMOR perception on our real-world GR1 humanoid from Fourier Intelligence. We are going to update the link to the source code, HW description, and 3D CAD files in the arXiv version of this text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ramin Mousa, Saeed Chamani, Mohammad Morsali, Mohammad Kazzazi, Parsa Hatami, Soroush Sarabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Skin cancer (SC) stands out as one of the most life-threatening forms of cancer, with its danger amplified if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early intervention is critical, as it allows for more effective treatment approaches. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool in the early detection and skin cancer diagnosis (SCD). Although the DL seems promising for the diagnosis of skin cancer, still ample scope exists for improving model efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach to skin cancer detection, utilizing optimization techniques in conjunction with pre-trained networks and wavelet transformations. First, normalized images will undergo pre-trained networks such as Densenet-121, Inception, Xception, and MobileNet to extract hierarchical features from input images. After feature extraction, the feature maps are passed through a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) layer to capture low and high-frequency components. Then the self-attention module is integrated to learn global dependencies between features and focus on the most relevant parts of the feature maps. The number of neurons and optimization of the weight vectors are performed using three new swarm-based optimization techniques, such as Modified Gorilla Troops Optimizer (MGTO), Improved Gray Wolf Optimization (IGWO), and Fox optimization algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that optimizing weight vectors using optimization algorithms can enhance diagnostic accuracy and make it a highly effective approach for SCD. The proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy, achieving top rates of 98.11% with the MobileNet + Wavelet + FOX and DenseNet + Wavelet + Fox combination on the ISIC-2016 dataset and 97.95% with the Inception + Wavelet + MGTO combination on the ISIC-2017 dataset, which improves accuracy by at least 1% compared to other methods.</p>

While previous work has explored decoding and cleaning up these vectors under the noise that arises during computation, existing methods are limited. Cleanup methods are essential for robust computation within a VSA. However, cleanup methods for continuous-value encodings are not as effective. In this paper, we present an iterative optimization method to decode and clean up Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) vectors that are encoding continuous values. We combine composite likelihood estimation (CLE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to ensure convergence to the global optimum. We also demonstrate that this method can effectively decode FHRR vectors under different noise conditions, and show that it outperforms existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ismail Lotfi, Nouf Alabbasi, Omar Alhussein</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in designing strategic mechanisms -- including auctions, contracts, and games -- for specific purposes in communication networks. Traditionally, strategic mechanism design in telecommunications has relied on human expertise to craft solutions based on game theory, auction theory, and contract theory. However, the evolving landscape of telecom networks, characterized by increasing abstraction, emerging use cases, and novel value creation opportunities, calls for more adaptive and efficient approaches. We propose leveraging LLMs to automate or semi-automate the process of strategic mechanism design, from intent specification to final formulation. This paradigm shift introduces both semi-automated and fully-automated design pipelines, raising crucial questions about faithfulness to intents, incentive compatibility, algorithmic stability, and the balance between human oversight and artificial intelligence (AI) autonomy. The paper discusses potential frameworks, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems, to implement LLM-driven mechanism design in communication networks contexts. We examine key challenges, including LLM limitations in capturing domain-specific constraints, ensuring strategy proofness, and integrating with evolving telecom standards. By providing an in-depth analysis of the synergies and tensions between LLMs and strategic mechanism design within the IoT ecosystem, this work aims to stimulate discussion on the future of AI-driven information economic mechanisms in telecommunications and their potential to address complex, dynamic network management scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jakob Burkhardt, Hannah Keller, Claudio Orlandi, Chris Schwiegelshohn</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the use of distributed differentially private computations across multiple servers, balancing the tradeoff between the error introduced by the differentially private mechanism and the computational efficiency of the resulting distributed algorithm.
  We introduce the linear-transformation model, where clients have access to a trusted platform capable of applying a public matrix to their inputs. Such computations can be securely distributed across multiple servers using simple and efficient secure multiparty computation techniques.
  The linear-transformation model serves as an intermediate model between the highly expressive central model and the minimal local model. In the central model, clients have access to a trusted platform capable of applying any function to their inputs. However, this expressiveness comes at a cost, as it is often expensive to distribute such computations, leading to the central model typically being implemented by a single trusted server. In contrast, the local model assumes no trusted platform, which forces clients to add significant noise to their data. The linear-transformation model avoids the single point of failure for privacy present in the central model, while also mitigating the high noise required in the local model.
  We demonstrate that linear transformations are very useful for differential privacy, allowing for the computation of linear sketches of input data. These sketches largely preserve utility for tasks such as private low-rank approximation and private ridge regression, while introducing only minimal error, critically independent of the number of clients. Previously, such accuracy had only been achieved in the more expressive central model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edith Haim, Natalie Fischer, Salvatore Citraro, Giulio Rossetti, Massimo Stella</p>
<p>Abstract: Creativity is a fundamental skill of human cognition. We use textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) to extract network (semantic/syntactic associations) and emotional features from approximately one thousand human- and GPT3.5-generated stories. Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we test whether features relative to Mednick's associative theory of creativity can explain creativity ratings assigned by humans and GPT-3.5. Using XGBoost, we examine three scenarios: (i) human ratings of human stories, (ii) GPT-3.5 ratings of human stories, and (iii) GPT-3.5 ratings of GPT-generated stories. Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5 ratings differ significantly from human ratings not only in terms of correlations but also because of feature patterns identified with XAI methods. GPT-3.5 favours 'its own' stories and rates human stories differently from humans. Feature importance analysis with SHAP scores shows that: (i) network features are more predictive for human creativity ratings but also for GPT-3.5's ratings of human stories; (ii) emotional features played a greater role than semantic/syntactic network structure in GPT-3.5 rating its own stories. These quantitative results underscore key limitations in GPT-3.5's ability to align with human assessments of creativity. We emphasise the need for caution when using GPT-3.5 to assess and generate creative content, as it does not yet capture the nuanced complexity that characterises human creativity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robotic manipulators are critical in many applications but are known to degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches -- (1) a novel closed-form expression for Remaining Lifetime Distribution (RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a higher proportion of high-severity tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Negin Amirshirzad, Mehmet Arda Eren, Erhan Oztop</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight learning from demonstration (LfD) model based on reservoir computing that can learn and generate multiple movement trajectories with prediction intervals, which we call as Context-based Echo State Network with prediction confidence (CESN+). CESN+ can generate movement trajectories that may go beyond the initial LfD training based on a desired set of conditions while providing confidence on its generated output. To assess the abilities of CESN+, we first evaluate its performance against Conditional Neural Movement Primitives (CNMP), a comparable framework that uses a conditional neural process to generate movement primitives. Our findings indicate that CESN+ not only outperforms CNMP but is also faster to train and demonstrates impressive performance in generating trajectories for extrapolation cases. In human-robot shared control applications, the confidence of the machine generated trajectory is a key indicator of how to arbitrate control sharing. To show the usability of the CESN+ for human-robot adaptive shared control, we have designed a proof-of-concept human-robot shared control task and tested its efficacy in adapting the sharing weight between the human and the robot by comparing it to a fixed-weight control scheme. The simulation experiments show that with CESN+ based adaptive sharing the total human load in shared control can be significantly reduced. Overall, the developed CESN+ model is a strong lightweight LfD system with desirable properties such fast training and ability to extrapolate to the new task parameters while producing robust prediction intervals for its output.</p>

<p>Abstract: Space debris presents a critical challenge for the sustainability of future space missions, emphasizing the need for robust and standardized identification methods. However, a comprehensive benchmark for rocket body classification remains absent. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the RoBo6 dataset for rocket body classification based on light curves. The dataset, derived from the Mini Mega Tortora database, includes light curves for six rocket body classes: CZ-3B, Atlas 5 Centaur, Falcon 9, H-2A, Ariane 5, and Delta 4. With 5,676 training and 1,404 test samples, it addresses data inconsistencies using resampling, normalization, and filtering techniques. Several machine learning models were evaluated, including CNN and transformer-based approaches, with Astroconformer reporting the best performance. The dataset establishes a common benchmark for future comparisons and advancements in rocket body classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Mohasel Afshar, Gilad Francis, Sally Cripps</p>
<p>Abstract: Particle-based methods include a variety of techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), for approximating a probabilistic target distribution with a set of weighted particles. In this paper, we prove that for any set of particles, there is a unique weighting mechanism that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the (particle-based) approximation from the target distribution, when that distribution is discrete -- any other weighting mechanism (e.g. MCMC weighting that is based on particles' repetitions in the Markov chain) is sub-optimal with respect to this divergence measure. Our proof does not require any restrictions either on the target distribution, or the process by which the particles are generated, other than the discreteness of the target. We show that the optimal weights can be determined based on values that any existing particle-based method already computes; As such, with minimal modifications and no extra computational costs, the performance of any particle-based method can be improved. Our empirical evaluations are carried out on important applications of discrete distributions including Bayesian Variable Selection and Bayesian Structure Learning. The results illustrate that our proposed reweighting of the particles improves any particle-based approximation to the target distribution consistently and often substantially.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michail Dontas, Yutong He, Naoki Murata, Yuki Mitsufuji, J. Zico Kolter, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p>
<p>Abstract: Blind inverse problems, where both the target data and forward operator are unknown, are crucial to many computer vision applications. Existing methods often depend on restrictive assumptions such as additional training, operator linearity, or narrow image distributions, thus limiting their generalizability. In this work, we present LADiBI, a training-free framework that uses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems with minimal assumptions. By leveraging natural language prompts, LADiBI jointly models priors for both the target image and operator, allowing for flexible adaptation across a variety of tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel posterior sampling approach that combines effective operator initialization with iterative refinement, enabling LADiBI to operate without predefined operator forms. Our experiments show that LADiBI is capable of solving a broad range of image restoration tasks, including both linear and nonlinear problems, on diverse target image distributions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Liquid composites moulding is an important manufacturing technology for fibre reinforced composites, due to its cost-effectiveness. Challenges lie in the optimisation of the process due to the lack of understanding of key characteristic of textile fabrics - permeability. The problem of computing the permeability coefficient can be modelled as the well-known Stokes-Brinkman equation, which introduces a heterogeneous parameter $\beta$ distinguishing macropore regions and fibre-bundle regions. In the present work, we train a Fourier neural operator to learn the nonlinear map from the heterogeneous coefficient $\beta$ to the velocity field $u$, and recover the corresponding macroscopic permeability $K$. This is a challenging inverse problem since both the input and output fields span several order of magnitudes, we introduce different regularization techniques for the loss function and perform a quantitative comparison between them.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonah Botvinick-Greenhouse, Robert Martin, Yunan Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariant measures are widely used to compare chaotic dynamical systems, as they offer robustness to noisy data, uncertain initial conditions, and irregular sampling. However, large classes of systems with distinct transient dynamics can still exhibit the same asymptotic statistical behavior, which poses challenges when invariant measures alone are used to perform system identification. Motivated by Takens' seminal embedding theory, we propose studying invariant measures in time-delay coordinates, which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the underlying dynamics. Our first result demonstrates that a single invariant measure in time-delay coordinates can be used to perform system identification up to a topological conjugacy. This result already surpasses the capabilities of invariant measures in the original state coordinate. Continuing to explore the power of delay-coordinates, we eliminate all ambiguity from the conjugacy relation by showing that unique system identification can be achieved using additional invariant measures in time-delay coordinates constructed from different observables. Our findings improve the effectiveness of invariant measures in system identification and broaden the scope of measure-theoretic approaches to modeling dynamical systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shing-Hei Ho, Bao Thach, Minghan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a framework to edit real-world Lidar scans with novel object layouts while preserving a realistic background environment. Compared to the synthetic data generation frameworks where Lidar point clouds are generated from scratch, our framework focuses on new scenario generation in a given background environment, and our method also provides labels for the generated data. This approach ensures the generated data remains relevant to the specific environment, aiding both the development and the evaluation of algorithms in real-world scenarios. Compared with novel view synthesis, our framework allows the creation of counterfactual scenarios with significant changes in the object layout and does not rely on multi-frame optimization. In our framework, the object removal and insertion are supported by generative background inpainting and object point cloud completion, and the entire pipeline is built upon spherical voxelization, which realizes the correct Lidar projective geometry by construction. Experiments show that our framework generates realistic Lidar scans with object layout changes and benefits the development of Lidar-based self-driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Heitor R. Medeiros, Atif Belal, Srikanth Muralidharan, Eric Granger, Marco Pedersoli</p>
<p>Abstract: The zero-shot performance of object detectors degrades when tested on different modalities, such as infrared and depth. While recent work has explored image translation techniques to adapt detectors to new modalities, these methods are limited to a single modality and apply only to traditional detectors. Recently, vision-language detectors, such as YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, have shown promising zero-shot capabilities, however, they have not yet been adapted for other visual modalities. Traditional fine-tuning approaches tend to compromise the zero-shot capabilities of the detectors. The visual prompt strategies commonly used for classification with vision-language models apply the same linear prompt translation to each image making them less effective. To address these limitations, we propose ModPrompt, a visual prompt strategy to adapt vision-language detectors to new modalities without degrading zero-shot performance. In particular, an encoder-decoder visual prompt strategy is proposed, further enhanced by the integration of inference-friendly task residuals, facilitating more robust adaptation. Empirically, we benchmark our method for modality adaptation on two vision-language detectors, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, and on challenging infrared (LLVIP, FLIR) and depth (NYUv2) data, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning while preserving the model's zero-shot capability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zilin Du, Haoxin Li, Jianfei Yu, Boyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grounding aims to localize the image regions based on a textual query. Given the difficulty of large-scale data curation, we investigate how to effectively learn visual grounding under data-scarce settings in this paper. To address data scarcity, we propose a novel framework, POBF (Paint Outside the Box, then Filter). POBF synthesizes images by inpainting outside the box, tackling a label misalignment issue encountered in previous works. Furthermore, POBF leverages an innovative filtering scheme to identify the most effective training data. This scheme combines a hardness score and an overfitting score, balanced by a penalty term. Experimental results show that POBF achieves superior performance across four datasets, delivering an average improvement of 5.83% and outperforming leading baselines by 2.29% to 3.85% in accuracy. Additionally, we validate the robustness and generalizability of POBF across various generative models, data ratios, and model architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Huang, Qingyu Huang, Jiayang Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing reliance on deep computer vision models that process sensitive data has raised significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the exposure of intermediate results in hidden layers. While traditional privacy risk assessment techniques focus on protecting overall model outputs, they often overlook vulnerabilities within these intermediate representations. Current privacy risk assessment techniques typically rely on specific attack simulations to assess risk, which can be computationally expensive and incomplete. This paper introduces a novel approach to measuring privacy risks in deep computer vision models based on the Degrees of Freedom (DoF) and sensitivity of intermediate outputs, without requiring adversarial attack simulations. We propose a framework that leverages DoF to evaluate the amount of information retained in each layer and combines this with the rank of the Jacobian matrix to assess sensitivity to input variations. This dual analysis enables systematic measurement of privacy risks at various model layers. Our experimental validation on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in providing deeper insights into privacy risks associated with intermediate representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Well log analysis is crucial for hydrocarbon exploration, providing detailed insights into subsurface geological formations. However, gaps and inaccuracies in well log data, often due to equipment limitations, operational challenges, and harsh subsurface conditions, can introduce significant uncertainties in reservoir evaluation. Addressing these challenges requires effective methods for both synthetic data generation and precise imputation of missing data, ensuring data completeness and reliability. This study introduces a novel framework utilizing sequence-based generative adversarial networks (GANs) specifically designed for well log data generation and imputation. The framework integrates two distinct sequence-based GAN models: Time Series GAN (TSGAN) for generating synthetic well log data and Sequence GAN (SeqGAN) for imputing missing data. Both models were tested on a dataset from the North Sea, Netherlands region, focusing on different sections of 5, 10, and 50 data points. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior accuracy in filling data gaps compared to other deep learning models for spatial series analysis. The method yielded R^2 values of 0.921, 0.899, and 0.594, with corresponding mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 8.320, 0.005, and 151.154, and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.012, 0.005, and 0.032, respectively. These results set a new benchmark for data integrity and utility in geosciences, particularly in well log data analysis.</p>

Over the last decade, several papers have been written on generating documentation for source code using neural network architectures. With the recent advancements in LLM technology, some open-source applications have been developed to address this problem. However, these applications typically rely on the OpenAI APIs, which incur substantial financial costs, particularly for large repositories. Moreover, none of these open-source applications offer a fine-tuned model or features to enable users to fine-tune. Additionally, finding suitable data for fine-tuning is often challenging.

<p>Abstract: Existing methodologies for animating portrait images face significant challenges, particularly in handling non-frontal perspectives, rendering dynamic objects around the portrait, and generating immersive, realistic backgrounds. In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes.

<p>Abstract: This work introduces the first framework for reconstructing surgical dialogue from unstructured real-world recordings, which is crucial for characterizing teaching tasks. In surgical training, the formative verbal feedback that trainers provide to trainees during live surgeries is crucial for ensuring safety, correcting behavior immediately, and facilitating long-term skill acquisition. However, analyzing and quantifying this feedback is challenging due to its unstructured and specialized nature. Automated systems are essential to manage these complexities at scale, allowing for the creation of structured datasets that enhance feedback analysis and improve surgical education. Our framework integrates voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and automated speech recaognition, with a novel enhancement that 1) removes hallucinations (non-existent utterances generated during speech recognition fueled by noise in the operating room) and 2) separates speech from trainers and trainees using few-shot voice samples. These aspects are vital for reconstructing accurate surgical dialogues and understanding the roles of operating room participants. Using data from 33 real-world surgeries, we demonstrated the system's capability to reconstruct surgical teaching dialogues and detect feedback instances effectively (F1 score of 0.79+/-0.07). Moreover, our hallucination removal step improves feedback detection performance by ~14%. Evaluation on downstream clinically relevant tasks of predicting Behavioral Adjustment of trainees and classifying Technical feedback, showed performances comparable to manual annotations with F1 scores of 0.82+/0.03 and 0.81+/0.03 respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in supporting clinically relevant tasks and improving over manual methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhai Zhuo, Zheng Wang, Yuqian Fu, Tianwen Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: The source-free cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) task aims to transfer pretrained models to target domains utilizing minimal samples, eliminating the need for source domain data. Addressing this issue requires models to have robust generalization abilities and strong feature representation, aligning with the characteristics of large-scale pretrained models. However, large-scale models tend to lose representational ability in cross-domain scenarios due to limited sample diversity. \zlh{Given the abundant diversity provided by semantic modality, this paper leverages textual modality to enhance training sample diversity with CLP model}, meanwhile improving model transfer efficiency. Specifically, we propose the SeGD-VPT framework, which is divided into two phases. The first step aims to increase feature diversity by adding diversity prompts to each support sample, thereby generating varying input and enhancing sample diversity. Furthermore, we use diversity descriptions of classes to guide semantically meaningful learning of diversity prompts, proposing random combinations and selections of texts to increase textual diversity. Additionally, deep prompt tuning is introduced to enhance the model's transfer capability. After training of the first step, support samples with different diversity prompts are input into the CLIP backbone to generate enhanced features. After generation, the second phase trains classifiers using the generated features. Extensive experimental results across several benchmarks verify our method is comparable to SOTA source-utilized models and attain the best performance under the source-free CD-FSL setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyad Algahtani</p>
<p>Abstract: We present High-Throughput Hypothesis Evaluation in Description Logic (HT-HEDL). HT-HEDL is a high-performance hypothesis evaluation engine that accelerates hypothesis evaluation computations for inductive logic programming (ILP) learners using description logic (DL) for their knowledge representation; in particular, HT-HEDL targets accelerating computations for the $\mathcal{ALCQI}^{\mathcal{(D)}}$ DL language. HT-HEDL aggregates the computing power of multi-core CPUs with multi-GPUs to improve hypothesis computations at two levels: 1) the evaluation of a single hypothesis and 2) the evaluation of multiple hypotheses (i.e., batch of hypotheses). In the first level, HT-HEDL uses a single GPU or a vectorized multi-threaded CPU to evaluate a single hypothesis. In vectorized multi-threaded CPU evaluation, classical (scalar) CPU multi-threading is combined with CPU's extended vector instructions set to extract more CPU-based performance. The experimental results revealed that HT-HEDL increased performance using CPU-based evaluation (on a single hypothesis): from 20.4 folds using classical multi-threading to $\sim85$ folds using vectorized multi-threading. In the GPU-based evaluation, HT-HEDL achieved speedups of up to $\sim38$ folds for single hypothesis evaluation using a single GPU. To accelerate the evaluation of multiple hypotheses, HT-HEDL combines, in parallel, GPUs with multi-core CPUs to increase evaluation throughput (number of evaluated hypotheses per second). The experimental results revealed that HT-HEDL increased evaluation throughput by up to 29.3 folds using two GPUs and up to $\sim44$ folds using two GPUs combined with a CPU's vectorized multi-threaded evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SPILDL, a Scalable and Parallel Inductive Learner in Description Logic (DL). SPILDL is based on the DL-Learner (the state of the art in DL-based ILP learning). As a DL-based ILP learner, SPILDL targets the $\mathcal{ALCQI}^{\mathcal{(D)}}$ DL language, and can learn DL hypotheses expressed as disjunctions of conjunctions (using the $\sqcup$ operator). Moreover, SPILDL's hypothesis language also incorporates the use of string concrete roles (also known as string data properties in the Web Ontology Language, OWL); As a result, this incorporation of powerful DL constructs, enables SPILDL to learn powerful DL-based hypotheses for describing many real-world complex concepts. SPILDL employs a hybrid parallel approach which combines both shared-memory and distributed-memory approaches, to accelerates ILP learning (for both hypothesis search and evaluation). According to experimental results, SPILDL's parallel search improved performance by up to $\sim$27.3 folds (best case). For hypothesis evaluation, SPILDL improved evaluation performance through HT-HEDL (our multi-core CPU + multi-GPU hypothesis evaluation engine), by up to 38 folds (best case). By combining both parallel search and evaluation, SPILDL improved performance by up to $\sim$560 folds (best case). In terms of worst case scenario, SPILDL's parallel search doesn't provide consistent speedups on all datasets, and is highly dependent on the search space nature of the ILP dataset. For some datasets, increasing the number of parallel search threads result in reduced performance, similar or worse than baseline. Some ILP datasets benefit from parallel search, while others don't (or the performance gains are negligible). In terms of parallel evaluation, on small datasets, parallel evaluation provide similar or worse performance than baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arijit Samal, Haroon R Lone</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-invasive temperature monitoring of individuals plays a crucial role in identifying and isolating symptomatic individuals. Temperature monitoring becomes particularly vital in settings characterized by close human proximity, often referred to as dense settings. However, existing research on non-invasive temperature estimation using thermal cameras has predominantly focused on sparse settings. Unfortunately, the risk of disease transmission is significantly higher in dense settings like movie theaters or classrooms. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop robust temperature estimation methods tailored explicitly for dense settings.
  Our study proposes a non-invasive temperature estimation system that combines a thermal camera with an edge device. Our system employs YOLO models for face detection and utilizes a regression framework for temperature estimation. We evaluated the system on a diverse dataset collected in dense and sparse settings. Our proposed face detection model achieves an impressive mAP score of over 84 in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Furthermore, the regression framework demonstrates remarkable performance with a mean square error of 0.18$^{\circ}$C and an impressive $R^2$ score of 0.96. Our experiments' results highlight the developed system's effectiveness, positioning it as a promising solution for continuous temperature monitoring in real-world applications. With this paper, we release our dataset and programming code publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyriakos Flouris, Anna Volokitin, Gustav Bredell, Ender Konukoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant, approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence. To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows, where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/k-flouris/gfe}.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaoshen Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

<p>Abstract: The semi-supervised learning (SSL) strategy in lightweight models requires reducing annotated samples and facilitating cost-effective inference. However, the constraint on model parameters, imposed by the scarcity of training labels, limits the SSL performance. In this paper, we introduce PS-NET, a novel framework tailored for semi-supervised text mining with lightweight models. PS-NET incorporates online distillation to train lightweight student models by imitating the Teacher model. It also integrates an ensemble of student peers that collaboratively instruct each other. Additionally, PS-NET implements a constant adversarial perturbation schema to further self-augmentation by progressive generalizing. Our PS-NET, equipped with a 2-layer distilled BERT, exhibits notable performance enhancements over SOTA lightweight SSL frameworks of FLiText and DisCo in SSL text classification with extremely rare labelled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Balazs, Michael Multerer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, samplets have been introduced as localized discrete signed measures which are tailored to an underlying data set. Samplets exhibit vanishing moments, i.e., their measure integrals vanish for all polynomials up to a certain degree, which allows for feature detection and data compression. In the present article, we extend the different construction steps of samplets to functionals in Banach spaces more general than point evaluations. To obtain stable representations, we assume that these functionals form frames with square-summable coefficients or even Riesz bases with square-summable coefficients. In either case, the corresponding analysis operator is injective and we obtain samplet bases with the desired properties by means of constructing an isometry of the analysis operator's image. Making the assumption that the dual of the Banach space under consideration is imbedded into the space of compactly supported distributions, the multilevel hierarchy for the generalized samplet construction is obtained by spectral clustering of a similarity graph for the functionals' supports. Based on this multilevel hierarchy, generalized samplets exhibit vanishing moments with respect to a given set of primitives within the Banach space. We derive an abstract localization result for the generalized samplet coefficients with respect to the samplets' support sizes and the approximability of the Banach space elements by the chosen primitives. Finally, we present three examples showcasing the generalized samplet framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Bergner, Christoph Lippert, Aravindh Mahendran</p>
<p>Abstract: The adoption of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in resource-constrained applications necessitates improvements in inference throughput. To this end several token pruning and merging approaches have been proposed that improve efficiency by successively reducing the number of tokens. However, it remains an open problem to design a token reduction method that is fast, maintains high performance, and is applicable to various vision tasks. In this work, we present a token pruner that uses auxiliary prediction heads that learn to select tokens end-to-end based on task relevance. These auxiliary heads can be removed after training, leading to throughput close to that of a random pruner. We evaluate our method on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation, and show speedups of 1.5 to 4x with small drops in performance. As a best case, on the ADE20k semantic segmentation benchmark, we observe a 2x speedup relative to the no-pruning baseline, with a negligible performance penalty of 0.1 median mIoU across 5 seeds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Marashian, Enora Rice, Luke Gessler, Alexis Palmer, Katharina von der Wense</p>
<p>Abstract: Many of the world's languages have insufficient data to train high-performing general neural machine translation (NMT) models, let alone domain-specific models, and often the only available parallel data are small amounts of religious texts. Hence, domain adaptation (DA) is a crucial issue faced by contemporary NMT and has, so far, been underexplored for low-resource languages. In this paper, we evaluate a set of methods from both low-resource NMT and DA in a realistic setting, in which we aim to translate between a high-resource and a low-resource language with access to only: a) parallel Bible data, b) a bilingual dictionary, and c) a monolingual target-domain corpus in the high-resource language. Our results show that the effectiveness of the tested methods varies, with the simplest one, DALI, being most effective. We follow up with a small human evaluation of DALI, which shows that there is still a need for more careful investigation of how to accomplish DA for low-resource NMT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Schr\"oder, Zijing Ou, Yingzhen Li, Andrew B. Duncan</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for probabilistic modelling across various data domains. However, training EBMs on data in discrete or mixed state spaces poses significant challenges due to the lack of robust and fast sampling methods. In this work, we propose to train discrete EBMs with Energy Discrepancy, a loss function which only requires the evaluation of the energy function at data points and their perturbed counterparts, thus eliminating the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo. We introduce perturbations of the data distribution by simulating a diffusion process on the discrete state space endowed with a graph structure. This allows us to inform the choice of perturbation from the structure of the modelled discrete variable, while the continuous time parameter enables fine-grained control of the perturbation. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches in a wide range of applications, including the estimation of discrete densities with non-binary vocabulary and binary image modelling. Finally, we train EBMs on tabular data sets with applications in synthetic data generation and calibrated classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: The predominant success of diffusion models in generative modeling has spurred significant interest in understanding their theoretical foundations. In this work, we propose a feature learning framework aimed at analyzing and comparing the training dynamics of diffusion models with those of traditional classification models. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under identical settings, diffusion models, due to the denoising objective, are encouraged to learn more balanced and comprehensive representations of the data. In contrast, neural networks with a similar architecture trained for classification tend to prioritize learning specific patterns in the data, often focusing on easy-to-learn components. To support these theoretical insights, we conduct several experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which empirically validate our findings and highlight the distinct feature learning dynamics in diffusion models compared to classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into multistep agent systems enable complex decision-making processes across various applications. However, their outputs often lack reliability, making uncertainty estimation crucial. Existing uncertainty estimation methods primarily focus on final-step outputs, which fail to account for cumulative uncertainty over the multistep decision-making process and the dynamic interactions between agents and their environments. To address these limitations, we propose SAUP (Situation Awareness Uncertainty Propagation), a novel framework that propagates uncertainty through each step of an LLM-based agent's reasoning process. SAUP incorporates situational awareness by assigning situational weights to each step's uncertainty during the propagation. Our method, compatible with various one-step uncertainty estimation techniques, provides a comprehensive and accurate uncertainty measure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAUP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 20% improvement in AUROC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based policy models like vision-language-action (VLA) models are transformative in automating complex decision-making across applications by interpreting multi-modal data. However, scaling these models greatly increases computational costs, which presents challenges in fields like robot manipulation and autonomous driving that require quick, accurate responses. To address the need for deployment on resource-limited hardware, we propose a new quantization framework for IL-based policy models that fine-tunes parameters to enhance robustness against low-bit precision errors during training, thereby maintaining efficiency and reliability under constrained conditions. Our evaluations with representative robot manipulation for 4-bit weight-quantization on a real edge GPU demonstrate that our framework achieves up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings while preserving accuracy. For 4-bit weight and activation quantized self-driving models, the framework achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 3.1x energy saving on a low-end GPU. These results highlight the practical potential of deploying IL-based policy models on resource-constrained devices.</p>

<p>Abstract: Private inference (PI) serves an important role in guaranteeing the privacy of user data when interfacing with proprietary machine learning models such as LLMs. However, PI remains practically intractable due to the massive latency costs associated with nonlinear functions present in LLMs. Existing works have focused on improving latency of specific LLM nonlinearities (such as the Softmax, or the GeLU) via approximations. However, new types of nonlinearities are regularly introduced with new LLM architectures, and this has led to a constant game of catch-up where PI researchers attempt to optimize the newest nonlinear function. We introduce TruncFormer, a framework for taking any LLM and transforming it into a plaintext emulation of PI. Our framework leverages the fact that nonlinearities in LLMs are differentiable and can be accurately approximated with a sequence of additions, multiplications, and truncations. Further, we decouple the add/multiply and truncation operations, and statically determine where truncations should be inserted based on a given field size and input representation size. This leads to latency improvements over existing cryptographic protocols that enforce truncation after every multiplication operation. We open source our code for community use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linxin Yang, Bingheng Li, Tian Ding, Jianghua Wu, Akang Wang, Yuyi Wang, Jiliang Tang, Ruoyu Sun, Xiaodong Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Quadratic programs (QPs) arise in various domains such as machine learning, finance, and control. Recently, learning-enhanced primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) methods have shown great potential in addressing large-scale linear programs; however, this approach has not been extended to QPs. In this work, we focus on unrolling "PDQP", a PDHG algorithm specialized for convex QPs. Specifically, we propose a neural network model called "PDQP-net" to learn optimal QP solutions. Theoretically, we demonstrate that a PDQP-net of polynomial size can align with the PDQP algorithm, returning optimal primal-dual solution pairs. We propose an unsupervised method that incorporates KKT conditions into the loss function. Unlike the standard learning-to-optimize framework that requires optimization solutions generated by solvers, our unsupervised method adjusts the network weights directly from the evaluation of the primal-dual gap. This method has two benefits over supervised learning: first, it helps generate better primal-dual gap since the primal-dual gap is in the objective function; second, it does not require solvers. We show that PDQP-net trained in this unsupervised manner can effectively approximate optimal QP solutions. Extensive numerical experiments confirm our findings, indicating that using PDQP-net predictions to warm-start PDQP can achieve up to 45% acceleration on QP instances. Moreover, it achieves 14% to 31% acceleration on out-of-distribution instances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Homa Nikbakht (Shitz), Mich\`ele Wigger (Shitz), Shlomo Shamai (Shitz), H. Vincent Poor</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider a point-to-point integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a transmitter conveys a message to a receiver over a channel with memory and simultaneously estimates the state of the channel through the backscattered signals from the emitted waveform. Using Massey's concept of directed information for channels with memory, we formulate the capacity-distortion tradeoff for the ISAC problem when sensing is performed in an online fashion. Optimizing the transmit waveform for this system to simultaneously achieve good communication and sensing performance is a complicated task, and thus we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to find a solution. The proposed approach enables the agent to optimize the ISAC performance by learning a reward that reflects the difference between the communication gain and the sensing loss. Since the state-space in our RL model is \`a priori unbounded, we employ deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). Our numerical results suggest a significant performance improvement when one considers unbounded state-space as opposed to a simpler RL problem with reduced state-space. In the extreme case of degenerate state-space only memoryless signaling strategies are possible. Our results thus emphasize the necessity of well exploiting the memory inherent in ISAC systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muchao Ye, Weiyang Liu, Pan He</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Jiang, Yao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification at unobserved spatial locations, especially in the presence of complex and heterogeneous datasets, remains a core challenge in spatial statistics. Traditional approaches like Kriging rely heavily on assumptions such as normality, which often break down in large-scale, diverse datasets, leading to unreliable prediction intervals. While machine learning methods have emerged as powerful alternatives, they primarily focus on point predictions and provide limited mechanisms for uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction, a distribution-free framework, offers valid prediction intervals without relying on parametric assumptions. However, existing conformal prediction methods are either not tailored for spatial settings, or existing ones for spatial data have relied on rather restrictive i.i.d. assumptions. In this paper, we propose Localized Spatial Conformal Prediction (LSCP), a conformal prediction method designed specifically for spatial data. LSCP leverages localized quantile regression to construct prediction intervals. Instead of i.i.d. assumptions, our theoretical analysis builds on weaker conditions of stationarity and spatial mixing, which is natural for spatial data, providing finite-sample bounds on the conditional coverage gap and establishing asymptotic guarantees for conditional coverage. We present experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that LSCP achieves accurate coverage with significantly tighter and more consistent prediction intervals across the spatial domain compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexuan Sun, Garvesh Raskutti</p>
<p>Abstract: As opaque black-box predictive models become more prevalent, the need to develop interpretations for these models is of great interest. The concept of variable importance and Shapley values are interpretability measures that applies to any predictive model and assesses how much a variable or set of variables improves prediction performance. When the number of variables is large, estimating variable importance presents a significant computational challenge because re-training neural networks or other black-box algorithms requires significant additional computation. In this paper, we address this challenge for algorithms using gradient descent and gradient boosting (e.g. neural networks, gradient-boosted decision trees). By using the ideas of early stopping of gradient-based methods in combination with warm-start using the dropout method, we develop a scalable method to estimate variable importance for any algorithm that can be expressed as an iterative kernel update equation. Importantly, we provide theoretical guarantees by using the theory for early stopping of kernel-based methods for neural networks with sufficiently large (but not necessarily infinite) width and gradient-boosting decision trees that use symmetric trees as a weaker learner. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through simulations and a real data example which illustrates the computational benefit of early stopping rather than fully re-training the model as well as the increased accuracy of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Dillmann, Rafael Mart\'inez-Galarza, Roberto Soria, Rosanne Di Stefano, Vinay L. Kashyap</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and unsupervised transient classification in high-energy datasets. This approach enabled the discovery of a new fast X-ray transient (FXT) in the Chandra archive, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous breakthroughs in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t Maps and E-t-dt Cubes, designed to capture both temporal and spectral information, effectively addressing the challenges posed by variable-length event file time series in machine learning applications. Our pipeline extracts low-dimensional, informative features from these representations using principal component analysis or sparse autoencoders, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbor searches around known transients, producing a catalog of 3,539 candidates (3,427 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard <10 s initial burst followed by spectral softening in an ~800 s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint LMXB in the LMC. Our method extends to datasets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takaaki Fujita</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional graphs by allowing edges to connect multiple nodes, while superhypergraphs further generalize this concept to represent even more complex relationships. Neural networks, inspired by biological systems, are widely used for tasks such as pattern recognition, data classification, and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a well-established framework, have recently been extended to Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), with their properties and applications being actively studied. The Plithogenic Graph framework enhances graph representations by integrating multi-valued attributes, as well as membership and contradiction functions, enabling the detailed modeling of complex relationships. In the context of handling uncertainty, concepts such as Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs have gained prominence. It is well established that Plithogenic Graphs serve as a generalization of both Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Graph Neural Network has been proposed and is an active area of research. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the development of SuperHyperGraph Neural Networks (SHGNNs) and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks, expanding the applicability of neural networks to these advanced graph structures. While mathematical generalizations and proofs are presented, future computational experiments are anticipated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Colby Fronk, Linda Petzold</p>
<p>Abstract: Stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are common in many science and engineering fields, but standard neural ODE approaches struggle to accurately learn these stiff systems, posing a significant barrier to widespread adoption of neural ODEs. In our earlier work, we addressed this challenge by utilizing single-step implicit methods for solving stiff neural ODEs. While effective, these implicit methods are computationally costly and can be complex to implement. This paper expands on our earlier work by exploring explicit exponential integration methods as a more efficient alternative. We evaluate the potential of these explicit methods to handle stiff dynamics in neural ODEs, aiming to enhance their applicability to a broader range of scientific and engineering problems. We found the integrating factor Euler (IF Euler) method to excel in stability and efficiency. While implicit schemes failed to train the stiff Van der Pol oscillator, the IF Euler method succeeded, even with large step sizes. However, IF Euler's first-order accuracy limits its use, leaving the development of higher-order methods for stiff neural ODEs an open research problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gongfan Fang, Kunjun Li, Xinyin Ma, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image generation but often come with excessive parameterization, resulting in considerable inference overhead in real-world applications. In this work, we present TinyFusion, a depth pruning method designed to remove redundant layers from diffusion transformers via end-to-end learning. The core principle of our approach is to create a pruned model with high recoverability, allowing it to regain strong performance after fine-tuning. To accomplish this, we introduce a differentiable sampling technique to make pruning learnable, paired with a co-optimized parameter to simulate future fine-tuning. While prior works focus on minimizing loss or error after pruning, our method explicitly models and optimizes the post-fine-tuning performance of pruned models. Experimental results indicate that this learnable paradigm offers substantial benefits for layer pruning of diffusion transformers, surpassing existing importance-based and error-based methods. Additionally, TinyFusion exhibits strong generalization across diverse architectures, such as DiTs, MARs, and SiTs. Experiments with DiT-XL show that TinyFusion can craft a shallow diffusion transformer at less than 7% of the pre-training cost, achieving a 2$\times$ speedup with an FID score of 2.86, outperforming competitors with comparable efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Liao, Yongsheng Gao, Weichuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a Neuron Abandoning Attention Flow (NAFlow) method to address the open problem of visually explaining the attention evolution dynamics inside CNNs when making their classification decisions. A novel cascading neuron abandoning back-propagation algorithm is designed to trace neurons in all layers of a CNN that involve in making its prediction to address the problem of significant interference from abandoned neurons. Firstly, a Neuron Abandoning Back-Propagation (NA-BP) module is proposed to generate Back-Propagated Feature Maps (BPFM) by using the inverse function of the intermediate layers of CNN models, on which the neurons not used for decision-making are abandoned. Meanwhile, the cascading NA-BP modules calculate the tensors of importance coefficients which are linearly combined with the tensors of BPFMs to form the NAFlow. Secondly, to be able to visualize attention flow for similarity metric-based CNN models, a new channel contribution weights module is proposed to calculate the importance coefficients via Jacobian Matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed NAFlow is validated on nine widely-used CNN models for various tasks of general image classification, contrastive learning classification, few-shot image classification, and image retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuma Toji, Jun Takahashi, Vwani Roychowdhury, Hideyuki Miyahara</p>
<p>Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades.
  The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities.
  However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking.
  In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context sensitive grammars (CSG), and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model.
  We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly 0 to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider.
  Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase.
  This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but is generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamzah A. A. M. Qaid, Bo Zhang, Dan Li, See-Kiong Ng, Wei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are effective at capturing complex, valuable conceptual representations from textual data for a wide range of real-world applications. However, in fields like Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD), incorporating additional sensor data-such as vibration signals, temperature readings, and operational metrics-is essential but it is challenging to capture such sensor data information within traditional text corpora. This study introduces a novel IFD approach by effectively adapting LLMs to numerical data inputs for identifying various machine faults from time-series sensor data. We propose FD-LLM, an LLM framework specifically designed for fault diagnosis by formulating the training of the LLM as a multi-class classification problem. We explore two methods for encoding vibration signals: the first method uses a string-based tokenization technique to encode vibration signals into text representations, while the second extracts statistical features from both the time and frequency domains as statistical summaries of each signal. We assess the fault diagnosis capabilities of four open-sourced LLMs based on the FD-LLM framework, and evaluate the models' adaptability and generalizability under various operational conditions and machine components, namely for traditional fault diagnosis, cross-operational conditions, and cross-machine component settings. Our results show that LLMs such as Llama3 and Llama3-instruct demonstrate strong fault detection capabilities and significant adaptability across different operational conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) approaches in many cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> N. Sukumar, Amit Acharya</p>
<p>Abstract: Many partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Navier--Stokes equations in fluid mechanics, inelastic deformation in solids, and transient parabolic and hyperbolic equations do not have an exact, primal variational structure. Recently, a variational principle based on the dual (Lagrange multiplier) field was proposed. The essential idea in this approach is to treat the given PDE as constraints, and to invoke an arbitrarily chosen auxiliary potential with strong convexity properties to be optimized. This leads to requiring a convex dual functional to be minimized subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual variables, with the guarantee that even PDEs that do not possess a variational structure in primal form can be solved via a variational principle. The vanishing of the first variation of the dual functional is, up to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual fields, the weak form of the primal PDE problem with the dual-to-primal change of variables incorporated. We derive the dual weak form for the linear, one-dimensional, transient convection-diffusion equation. A Galerkin discretization is used to obtain the discrete equations, with the trial and test functions chosen as linear combination of either RePU activation functions (shallow neural network) or B-spline basis functions; the corresponding stiffness matrix is symmetric. For transient problems, a space-time Galerkin implementation is used with tensor-product B-splines as approximating functions. Numerical results are presented for the steady-state and transient convection-diffusion equation, and transient heat conduction. The proposed method delivers sound accuracy for ODEs and PDEs and rates of convergence are established in the $L^2$ norm and $H^1$ seminorm for the steady-state convection-diffusion problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bikang Pan, Qun Li, Xiaoying Tang, Wei Huang, Zhen Fang, Feng Liu, Jingya Wang, Jingyi Yu, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, has revolutionized image-text representation, enabling a broad range of applications via prompt learning. Despite its promise, real-world datasets often contain noisy labels that can degrade prompt learning performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that using mean absolute error (MAE) loss in prompt learning, named PromptMAE, significantly enhances robustness against noisy labels while maintaining high accuracy. Though MAE is straightforward and recognized for its robustness, it is rarely used in noisy-label learning due to its slow convergence and poor performance outside prompt learning scenarios. To elucidate the robustness of PromptMAE, we leverage feature learning theory to show that MAE can suppress the influence of noisy samples, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing overall robustness. Additionally, we introduce PromptOT, a prompt-based optimal transport data purification method to enhance the robustness further. PromptOT employs text encoder representations in vision-language models as prototypes to construct an optimal transportation matrix. This matrix effectively partitions datasets into clean and noisy subsets, allowing for the application of cross-entropy loss to the clean subset and MAE loss to the noisy subset. Our Noise-Label Prompt Learning method, named NLPrompt, offers a simple and efficient approach that leverages the expressive representation and precise alignment capabilities of vision-language models for robust prompt learning. We validate NLPrompt through extensive experiments across various noise settings, demonstrating significant performance improvements.</p>

<p>Abstract: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-based adversarial guidance using a negative prompt has emerged as a widely adopted approach to push the output features away from undesired concepts. While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be insufficient to capture complex visual concepts and avoid undesired visual elements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we explore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial guidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images in a batch. In particular, we introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but effective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance by selectively pushing apart matching semantic features (between reference and output generation) during the reverse diffusion process. When used w.r.t. other images in the same batch, we observe that NegToMe significantly increases output diversity (racial, gender, visual) without sacrificing output image quality. Similarly, when used w.r.t. a reference copyrighted asset, NegToMe helps reduce visual similarity with copyrighted content by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code, uses only marginally higher (<4%) inference times and generalizes to different diffusion architectures like Flux, which do not natively support the use of a separate negative prompt.

<p>Abstract: In this study, we introduce Convolutional Transformer Neural Collaborative Filtering (CTNCF), a novel approach aimed at enhancing recommendation systems by effectively capturing high-order structural information in user?item interactions. CTNCF represents a significant advancement over the traditional Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model by seamlessly integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer layers. This sophisticated integration enables the model to adeptly capture and understand complex interaction patterns inherent in recommendation systems. Specifically, CNNs are employed to extract local features from user and item embeddings, allowing the model to capture intricate spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore, the utilization of Transformer layers enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and interactions among user and item features, thereby enhancing its ability to understand the underlying relationships in the data. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed CTNCF framework, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that CTNCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its efficacy in improving recommendation system performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Xiao, Pengzhan Jin, Yifa Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we establish a deformation-based framework for learning solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains. The union of functions defined on varying domains can be identified as a metric space according to the deformation, then the solution mapping is regarded as a continuous metric-to-metric mapping, and subsequently can be represented by another continuous metric-to-Banach mapping using two different strategies, referred to as the D2D framework and the D2E framework, respectively. We point out that such a metric-to-Banach mapping can be learned by neural networks, hence the solution mapping is accordingly learned. With this framework, a rigorous convergence analysis is built for the problem of learning solution mappings of PDEs on varying domains. As the theoretical framework holds based on several pivotal assumptions which need to be verified for a given specific problem, we study the star domains as a typical example, and other situations could be similarly verified. There are three important features of this framework: (1) The domains under consideration are not required to be diffeomorphic, therefore a wide range of regions can be covered by one model provided they are homeomorphic. (2) The deformation mapping is unnecessary to be continuous, thus it can be flexibly established via combining a primary identity mapping and a local deformation mapping. This capability facilitates the resolution of large systems where only local parts of the geometry undergo change. (3) If a linearity-preserving neural operator such as MIONet is adopted, this framework still preserves the linearity of the surrogate solution mapping on its source term for linear PDEs, thus it can be applied to the hybrid iterative method. We finally present several numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetic data is gaining increasing popularity for face recognition technologies, mainly due to the privacy concerns and challenges associated with obtaining real data, including diverse scenarios, quality, and demographic groups, among others. It also offers some advantages over real data, such as the large amount of data that can be generated or the ability to customize it to adapt to specific problem-solving needs. To effectively use such data, face recognition models should also be specifically designed to exploit synthetic data to its fullest potential. In order to promote the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and investigate the application of synthetic data to better train face recognition systems, we introduce the 2nd FRCSyn-onGoing challenge, based on the 2nd Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn), originally launched at CVPR 2024. This is an ongoing challenge that provides researchers with an accessible platform to benchmark i) the proposal of novel Generative AI methods and synthetic data, and ii) novel face recognition systems that are specifically proposed to take advantage of synthetic data. We focus on exploring the use of synthetic data both individually and in combination with real data to solve current challenges in face recognition such as demographic bias, domain adaptation, and performance constraints in demanding situations, such as age disparities between training and testing, changes in the pose, or occlusions. Very interesting findings are obtained in this second edition, including a direct comparison with the first one, in which synthetic databases were restricted to DCFace and GANDiffFace.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel analysis of FedAvg with constant step size, relying on the Markov property of the underlying process. We demonstrate that the global iterates of the algorithm converge to a stationary distribution and analyze its resulting bias and variance relative to the problem's solution. We provide a first-order expansion of the bias in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Interestingly, this bias decomposes into two distinct components: one that depends solely on stochastic gradient noise and another on client heterogeneity. Finally, we introduce a new algorithm based on the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation technique to mitigate this bias.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anian Ruoss, Fabio Pardo, Harris Chan, Bonnie Li, Volodymyr Mnih, Tim Genewein</p>
<p>Abstract: Today's largest foundation models have increasingly general capabilities, yet when used as agents, they often struggle with simple reasoning and decision-making tasks, even though they possess good factual knowledge of the task and how to solve it. In this paper, we present a benchmark to pressure-test these models' multimodal decision-making capabilities in the very long-context regime (up to one million tokens) and investigate whether they can learn from a large number of expert demonstrations in their context. We evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art frontier models as policies across a battery of simple interactive decision-making tasks: playing tic-tac-toe, chess, and Atari, navigating grid worlds, solving crosswords, and controlling a simulated cheetah. We measure the performance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, o1-mini, and o1-preview under increasing amounts of expert demonstrations in the context $\unicode{x2013}$ from no demonstrations up to 512 full episodes, pushing these models' multimodal long-context reasoning capabilities to their limits. Across our tasks, today's frontier models rarely manage to fully reach expert performance, showcasing the difficulty of our benchmark. Presenting more demonstrations often has little effect, but some models steadily improve with more demonstrations on a few tasks. We investigate the effect of encoding observations as text or images and the impact of chain-of-thought prompting. Overall, our results suggest that even today's most capable models often struggle to imitate desired behavior by generalizing purely from in-context demonstrations. To help quantify the impact of other approaches and future innovations aiming to tackle this problem, we open source our benchmark that covers the zero-, few-, and many-shot regimes in a unified evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashhadul Islam, Abdesselam Bouzerdoum, Samir Brahim Belhaouari</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional neural networks employ fixed weights during inference, limiting their ability to adapt to changing input conditions, unlike biological neurons that adjust signal strength dynamically based on stimuli. This discrepancy between artificial and biological neurons constrains neural network flexibility and adaptability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for adaptive neural networks, where neuron weights are modeled as functions of the input signal, allowing the network to adjust dynamically in real-time. Importantly, we achieve this within the same traditional architecture of an Artificial Neural Network, maintaining structural familiarity while introducing dynamic adaptability. In our research, we apply Chebyshev polynomials as one of the many possible decomposition methods to achieve this adaptive weighting mechanism, with polynomial coefficients learned during training. Out of the 145 datasets tested, our adaptive Chebyshev neural network demonstrated a marked improvement over an equivalent MLP in approximately 8\% of cases, performing strictly better on 121 datasets. In the remaining 24 datasets, the performance of our algorithm matched that of the MLP, highlighting its ability to generalize standard neural network behavior while offering enhanced adaptability. As a generalized form of the MLP, this model seamlessly retains MLP performance where needed while extending its capabilities to achieve superior accuracy across a wide range of complex tasks. These results underscore the potential of adaptive neurons to enhance generalization, flexibility, and robustness in neural networks, particularly in applications with dynamic or non-linear data dependencies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over the last few years, Shapley value (SV), a solution concept from cooperative game theory, has found numerous applications in data analytics (DA). This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of SV used throughout the DA workflow, which involves three main steps: data fabric, data exploration, and result reporting. We summarize existing versatile forms of SV used in these steps by a unified definition and clarify the essential functionalities that SV can provide for data scientists. We categorize the arts in this field based on the technical challenges they tackled, which include computation efficiency, approximation error, privacy preservation, and appropriate interpretations. We discuss these challenges and analyze the corresponding solutions. We also implement SVBench, the first open-sourced benchmark for developing SV applications, and conduct experiments on six DA tasks to validate our analysis and discussions. Based on the qualitative and quantitative results, we identify the limitations of current efforts for applying SV to DA and highlight the directions of future research and engineering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained audio and image models demonstrate an unprecedented degree of generalization, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. Here, we tackle the specific task of sound-prompted segmentation, aiming to segment image regions corresponding to objects heard in an audio signal. Most existing approaches tackle this problem by fine-tuning pre-trained models or by training additional modules specifically for the task. We adopt a different strategy: we introduce a training-free approach that leverages Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to co-factorize audio and visual features from pre-trained models to reveal shared interpretable concepts. These concepts are passed to an open-vocabulary segmentation model for precise segmentation maps. By using frozen pre-trained models, our method achieves high generalization and establishes state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised sound-prompted segmentation, significantly surpassing previous unsupervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Koen Minartz, Fleur Hendriks, Simon Martinus Koop, Alessandro Corbetta, Vlado Menkovski</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of pedestrian crowds is an outstanding challenge crucial for designing efficient urban infrastructure and ensuring safe crowd management. To this end, both small-scale laboratory and large-scale real-world measurements have been used. However, these approaches respectively lack statistical resolution and parametric controllability, both essential to discovering physical relationships underlying the complex stochastic dynamics of crowds. Here, we establish an investigation paradigm that offers laboratory-like controllability, while ensuring the statistical resolution of large-scale real-world datasets. Using our data-driven neural crowd simulator (\modelname{}), which we train on large-scale data and validate against key statistical features of crowd dynamics, we show that we can perform effective surrogate crowd dynamics experiments without training on specific scenarios. We not only reproduce known experimental results on pairwise avoidance, but also uncover the vision-guided and topologic nature of N-body interactions. These findings show how virtual experiments based on neural simulation enable data-driven scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Konz, Yuwen Chen, Hanxue Gu, Haoyu Dong, Yaqian Chen, Maciej A. Mazurowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different domain is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning, where domain shift is a common problem that commonly results in decreased model performance. This determination is also important to evaluate the output quality of generative models, e.g., image-to-image translation models used to mitigate domain shift. Current metrics for this either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., FID) from natural imaging which insufficiently capture anatomical consistency and realism in medical images. We introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images: Radiomic Feature Distance (RaD), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful and interpretable image features. We show that RaD is superior to other metrics for out-of-domain (OOD) detection in a variety of experiments. Furthermore, RaD outperforms previous perceptual metrics (FID, KID, etc.) for image-to-image translation by correlating more strongly with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism, and shows similar utility for evaluating unconditional image generation. RaD also offers additional benefits such as interpretability, as well as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes. Our results are supported by broad experiments spanning four multi-domain medical image datasets, nine downstream tasks, six image translation models, and other factors, highlighting the broad potential of RaD for medical image analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian Shuai, Yiding Wang, Yimeng Wu, Xin Jiang, Xiaozhe Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advances in recent years, with scaling laws playing a critical role in this rapid progress. In this paper, we empirically investigate how a critical hyper-parameter, i.e., the global batch size, influences the LLM training prdocess. We begin by training language models ranging from 125 million to 2.6 billion parameters, using up to 300 billion high-quality tokens. Through these experiments, we establish a basic scaling law on model size and training data amount. We then examine how varying batch sizes and learning rates affect the convergence and generalization of these models. Our analysis yields batch size scaling laws under two different cases: with a fixed compute budget, and with a fixed amount of training data. Extrapolation experiments on models of increasing sizes validate our predicted laws, which provides guidance for optimizing LLM training strategies under specific resource constraints.</p>

We propose to use machine learning to assist the simulation of measurement-induced quantum phenomena. In particular, we focus on the measurement-altered quantum criticality protocol and generate local reduced density matrices of the critical chain given random measurement results. Such generation is enabled by a physics-preserving conditional diffusion generative model, which learns an observation-indexed probability distribution of an ensemble of quantum states, and then samples from that distribution given an observation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Wang, Shiju Wang, Shenhan Zhu, Fangcheng Fu, Xinyi Liu, Xuefeng Xiao, Huixia Li, Jiashi Li, Faming Wu, Bin Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Extending the context length (i.e., the maximum supported sequence length) of LLMs is of paramount significance. To facilitate long context training of LLMs, sequence parallelism has emerged as an essential technique, which scatters each input sequence across multiple devices and necessitates communication to process the sequence. In essence, existing sequence parallelism methods assume homogeneous sequence lengths (i.e., all input sequences are equal in length) and therefore leverages a single, static scattering strategy for all input sequences. However, in reality, the sequence lengths in LLM training corpora exhibit substantial variability, often following a long-tail distribution, which leads to workload heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we show that employing a single, static strategy results in inefficiency and resource under-utilization, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches to handle the heterogeneous workloads across sequences. To address this, we propose a heterogeneity-adaptive sequence parallelism method. For each training step, our approach captures the variability in sequence lengths and assigns the optimal combination of scattering strategies based on workload characteristics. We model this problem as a linear programming optimization and design an efficient and effective solver to find the optimal solution. Furthermore, we implement our method in a high-performance system that supports adaptive parallelization in distributed LLM training. Experimental results demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art training frameworks by up to 1.98x.</p>

<p>Abstract: With computing now ubiquitous across government, industry, and education, cybersecurity has become a critical component for every organization on the planet. Due to this ubiquity of computing, cyber threats have continued to grow year over year, leading to labor shortages and a skills gap in cybersecurity. As a result, many cybersecurity product vendors and security organizations have looked to artificial intelligence to shore up their defenses. This work considers how to characterize attackers and defenders in one approach to the automation of cyber defense -- the application of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we characterize the types of attackers and defenders in the sense of Bayesian games and, using reinforcement learning, derive empirical findings about how to best train agents that defend against multiple types of attackers.</p>

<p>Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in many applications, from customer service chat bots and software development assistants to more capable agentic systems necessitates research into how to secure these systems. Attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking attempt to elicit responses and actions from these models that are not compliant with the safety, privacy, or content policies of organizations using the model in their application. In order to counter abuse of LLMs for generating potentially harmful replies or taking undesirable actions, LLM owners must apply safeguards during training and integrate additional tools to block the LLM from generating text that abuses the model. Jailbreaking prompts play a vital role in convincing an LLM to generate potentially harmful content, making it important to identify jailbreaking attempts to block any further steps. In this work, we propose a novel approach to detect jailbreak prompts based on pairing text embeddings well-suited for retrieval with traditional machine learning classification algorithms. Our approach outperforms all publicly available methods from open source LLM security applications.</p>

This approach allows us to rederive an AMP algorithm introduced by Fan and Opper et al., while shedding new light on the role of free cumulants of the spectral law. The free cumulants arise naturally from a recursive centering operation, potentially of independent interest beyond the scope of AMP. To illustrate the flexibility of our framework, we introduce two novel AMP variants and apply them to estimation in spiked models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose to integrate long-distance LongRange (LoRa) communication solution for sending the data from IoT to the edge computing system, by taking advantage of its unlicensed nature and the potential for open source implementations that are common in edge computing. We propose a channel hoping optimization model and apply TinyML-based channel hoping model based for LoRa transmissions, as well as experimentally study a fast predictive algorithm to find free channels between edge and IoT devices. In the open source experimental setup that includes LoRa, TinyML and IoT-edge-cloud continuum, we integrate a novel application workflow and cloud-friendly protocol solutions in a case study of plant recommender application that combines concepts of microfarming and urban computing. In a LoRa-optimized edge computing setup, we engineer the application workflow, and apply collaborative filtering and various machine learning algorithms on application data collected to identify and recommend the planting schedule for a specific microfarm in an urban area. In the LoRa experiments, we measure the occurrence of packet loss, RSSI, and SNR, using a random channel hoping scheme to compare with our proposed TinyML method. The results show that it is feasible to use TinyML in microcontrollers for channel hopping, while proving the effectiveness of TinyML in learning to predict the best channel to select for LoRa transmission, and by improving the RSSI by up to 63 %, SNR by up to 44 % in comparison with a random hopping mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maayan Ziv, Eli Galanti, Saburo Howard, Tristan Guillot, Yohai Kaspi</p>
<p>Abstract: The internal structure of Jupiter is constrained by the precise gravity field measurements by NASA's Juno mission, atmospheric data from the Galileo entry probe, and Voyager radio occultations. Not only are these observations few compared to the possible interior setups and their multiple controlling parameters, but they remain challenging to reconcile. As a complex, multidimensional problem, characterizing typical structures can help simplify the modeling process. We used NeuralCMS, a deep learning model based on the accurate concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS) method, coupled with a fully consistent wind model to efficiently explore a wide range of interior models without prior assumptions. We then identified those consistent with the measurements and clustered the plausible combinations of parameters controlling the interior. We determine the plausible ranges of internal structures and the dynamical contributions to Jupiter's gravity field. Four typical interior structures are identified, characterized by their envelope and core properties. This reduces the dimensionality of Jupiter's interior to only two effective parameters. Within the reduced 2D phase space, we show that the most observationally constrained structures fall within one of the key structures, but they require a higher 1 bar temperature than the observed value. We provide a robust framework for characterizing giant planet interiors with consistent wind treatment, demonstrating that for Jupiter, wind constraints strongly impact the gravity harmonics while the interior parameter distribution remains largely unchanged. Importantly, we find that Jupiter's interior can be described by two effective parameters that clearly distinguish the four characteristic structures and conclude that atmospheric measurements may not fully represent the entire envelope.</p>

<p>Abstract: Privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) aims to train a global model for multiple clients while maintaining their data privacy. However, current PPFL protocols exhibit one or more of the following insufficiencies: considerable degradation in accuracy, the requirement for sharing keys, and cooperation during the key generation or decryption processes. As a mitigation, we develop the first protocol that utilizes neural networks to implement PPFL, as well as incorporating an Aggregatable Hybrid Encryption scheme tailored to the needs of PPFL. We name these networks as Homomorphic Adversarial Networks (HANs) which demonstrate that neural networks are capable of performing tasks similar to multi-key homomorphic encryption (MK-HE) while solving the problems of key distribution and collaborative decryption. Our experiments show that HANs are robust against privacy attacks. Compared with non-private federated learning, experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that HANs exhibit a negligible accuracy loss (at most 1.35%). Compared to traditional MK-HE schemes, HANs increase encryption aggregation speed by 6,075 times while incurring a 29.2 times increase in communication overhead.</p>

<p>Abstract: Query rewrite is essential for optimizing SQL queries to improve their execution efficiency without changing their results. Traditionally, this task has been tackled through heuristic and learning-based methods, each with its limitations in terms of inferior quality and low robustness. Recent advancements in LLMs offer a new paradigm by leveraging their superior natural language and code comprehension abilities. Despite their potential, directly applying LLMs like GPT-4 has faced challenges due to problems such as hallucinations, where the model might generate inaccurate or irrelevant results. To address this, we propose R-Bot, an LLM-based query rewrite system with a systematic approach. We first design a multi-source rewrite evidence preparation pipeline to generate query rewrite evidences for guiding LLMs to avoid hallucinations. We then propose a hybrid structure-semantics retrieval method that combines structural and semantic analysis to retrieve the most relevant rewrite evidences for effectively answering an online query. We next propose a step-by-step LLM rewrite method that iteratively leverages the retrieved evidences to select and arrange rewrite rules with self-reflection. We conduct comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, and demonstrate the superior performance of our system, R-Bot, surpassing state-of-the-art query rewrite methods.</p>

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to their integration into peer review, with promising results such as substantial overlaps between LLM- and human-generated reviews. However, the unchecked adoption of LLMs poses significant risks to the integrity of the peer review system. In this study, we comprehensively analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM-generated reviews by focusing on manipulation and inherent flaws. Our experiments show that injecting covert deliberate content into manuscripts allows authors to explicitly manipulate LLM reviews, leading to inflated ratings and reduced alignment with human reviews. In a simulation, we find that manipulating 5% of the reviews could potentially cause 12% of the papers to lose their position in the top 30% rankings. Implicit manipulation, where authors strategically highlight minor limitations in their papers, further demonstrates LLMs' susceptibility compared to human reviewers, with a 4.5 times higher consistency with disclosed limitations. Additionally, LLMs exhibit inherent flaws, such as potentially assigning higher ratings to incomplete papers compared to full papers and favoring well-known authors in single-blind review process. These findings highlight the risks of over-reliance on LLMs in peer review, underscoring that we are not yet ready for widespread adoption and emphasizing the need for robust safeguards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haibo Xiu, Li Zhang, Tieying Zhang, Jun Yang, Jianjun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) systems, users often struggle to understand why query plans from one engine (OLAP or OLTP) perform significantly slower than those from another. Although optimizers provide plan details via the EXPLAIN function, these explanations are frequently too technical for non-experts and offer limited insights into performance differences across engines. To address this, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to explain query performance in HTAP systems. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our framework constructs a knowledge base that stores historical query executions and expert-curated explanations. To enable efficient retrieval of relevant knowledge, query plans are embedded using a lightweight tree-CNN classifier. This augmentation allows the LLM to generate clear, context-aware explanations of performance differences between engines. Our approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hybrid engine systems, paving the way for further advancements in database optimization and user support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raihan Ahmed, Shahed Chowdhury Omi, Md. Sadman Rahman, Niaz Rahman Bhuiyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Traveling through toll plazas is one of the primary causes of congestion, as identified in recent studies. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) systems can mitigate this problem. This experiment focuses on enhancing the security of ETC using RFID tags and number plate verification. For number plate verification, image processing is employed, and a CNN classifier is implemented to detect vehicle registration numbers. Based on the registered number, a notification email is sent to the respective owner for toll fee payment within a specific timeframe to avoid fines. Additionally, toll fees are automatically deducted in real-time from the owner's balance. This system benefits travelers by eliminating the need to queue for toll payment, thereby reducing delays and improving convenience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangyeon Yoon, Wonje Jeung, Albert No</p>
<p>Abstract: Auditing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) in the final model setting is challenging and often results in empirical lower bounds that are significantly looser than theoretical privacy guarantees. We introduce a novel auditing method that achieves tighter empirical lower bounds without additional assumptions by crafting worst-case adversarial samples through loss-based input-space auditing. Our approach surpasses traditional canary-based heuristics and is effective in both white-box and black-box scenarios. Specifically, with a theoretical privacy budget of $\varepsilon = 10.0$, our method achieves empirical lower bounds of $6.68$ in white-box settings and $4.51$ in black-box settings, compared to the baseline of $4.11$ for MNIST. Moreover, we demonstrate that significant privacy auditing results can be achieved using in-distribution (ID) samples as canaries, obtaining an empirical lower bound of $4.33$ where traditional methods produce near-zero leakage detection. Our work offers a practical framework for reliable and accurate privacy auditing in differentially private machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chamsi Hssaine, Sean R. Sinclair</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a censored variant of the data-driven newsvendor problem, where the decision-maker must select an ordering quantity that minimizes expected overage and underage costs based only on censored sales data, rather than historical demand realizations. To isolate the impact of demand censoring on this problem, we adopt a distributionally robust optimization framework, evaluating policies according to their worst-case regret over an ambiguity set of distributions. This set is defined by the largest historical order quantity (the observable boundary of the dataset), and contains all distributions matching the true demand distribution up to this boundary, while allowing them to be arbitrary afterwards. We demonstrate a spectrum of achievability under demand censoring by deriving a natural necessary and sufficient condition under which vanishing regret is an achievable goal. In regimes in which it is not, we exactly characterize the information loss due to censoring: an insurmountable lower bound on the performance of any policy, even when the decision-maker has access to infinitely many demand samples. We then leverage these sharp characterizations to propose a natural robust algorithm that adapts to the historical level of demand censoring. We derive finite-sample guarantees for this algorithm across all possible censoring regimes, and show its near-optimality with matching lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic factors). We moreover demonstrate its robust performance via extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Torne, Arhan Jain, Jiayi Yuan, Vidaaranya Macha, Lars Ankile, Anthony Simeonov, Pulkit Agrawal, Abhishek Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any additional human effort.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Nadali, Bingzhuo Zhong, Ashutosh Trivedi, Majid Zamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Transfer learning is an umbrella term for machine learning approaches that leverage knowledge gained from solving one problem (the source domain) to improve speed, efficiency, and data requirements in solving a different but related problem (the target domain). The performance of the transferred model in the target domain is typically measured via some notion of loss function in the target domain. This paper focuses on effectively transferring control logic from a source control system to a target control system while providing approximately similar behavioral guarantees in both domains. However, in the absence of a complete characterization of behavioral specifications, this problem cannot be captured in terms of loss functions. To overcome this challenge, we use (approximate) simulation relations to characterize observational equivalence between the behaviors of two systems.
  Simulation relations ensure that the outputs of both systems, equipped with their corresponding controllers, remain close to each other over time, and their closeness can be quantified {\it a priori}. By parameterizing simulation relations with neural networks, we introduce the notion of \emph{neural simulation relations}, which provides a data-driven approach to transfer any synthesized controller, regardless of the specification of interest, along with its proof of correctness. Compared with prior approaches, our method eliminates the need for a closed-loop mathematical model and specific requirements for both the source and target systems. We also introduce validity conditions that, when satisfied, guarantee the closeness of the outputs of two systems equipped with their corresponding controllers, thus eliminating the need for post-facto verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies involving a vehicle and a double inverted pendulum.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous flow model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model-based methods, including 78\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Extensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained with contrastive loss have achieved significant advancements in various vision and language tasks. However, the global nature of contrastive loss makes VLMs focus predominantly on foreground objects, neglecting other crucial information in the image, which limits their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose COSMOS: CrOSs-MOdality Self-distillation for vision-language pre-training that integrates a novel text-cropping strategy and cross-attention module into a self-supervised learning framework. We create global and local views of images and texts (i.e., multi-modal augmentations), which are essential for self-distillation in VLMs. We further introduce a cross-attention module, enabling COSMOS to learn comprehensive cross-modal representations optimized via a cross-modality self-distillation loss. COSMOS consistently outperforms previous strong baselines on various zero-shot downstream tasks, including retrieval, classification, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, it surpasses CLIP-based models trained on larger datasets in visual perception and contextual understanding tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Sun, Ziyang Chu, Pan Zhang, Tong Wu, Xiaoyi Dong, Yuhang Zang, Yuanjun Xiong, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs) open-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junfu Chen, Sirui Li, Dechang Pi</p>
<p>Abstract: Working memory (WM), denoting the information temporally stored in the mind, is a fundamental research topic in the field of human cognition. Electroencephalograph (EEG), which can monitor the electrical activity of the brain, has been widely used in measuring the level of WM. However, one of the critical challenges is that individual differences may cause ineffective results, especially when the established model meets an unfamiliar subject. In this work, we propose a cross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial attention (CS-DASA) to generalize the workload classifications across subjects. First, we transform EEG time series into multi-frame EEG images incorporating spatial, spectral, and temporal information. First, the Subject-Shared module in CS-DASA receives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target subjects and learns the common feature representations. Then, in the subject-specific module, the maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure the domain distribution divergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which can add an effective penalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the subject-to-subject spatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the discriminative spatial features from the target image data. Experiments conducted on a public WM EEG dataset containing 13 subjects show that the proposed model is capable of achieving better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongjun Zhang, Michael K. Ng</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for extracting physically meaningful latent factors from multi-dimensional nonnegative data, and has been an increasing interest in a variety of fields such as image processing, machine learning, and computer vision. In this paper, we propose a sparse nonnegative Tucker decomposition and completion method for the recovery of underlying nonnegative data under noisy observations. Here the underlying nonnegative data tensor is decomposed into a core tensor and several factor matrices with all entries being nonnegative and the factor matrices being sparse. The loss function is derived by the maximum likelihood estimation of the noisy observations, and the $\ell_0$ norm is employed to enhance the sparsity of the factor matrices. We establish the error bound of the estimator of the proposed model under generic noise scenarios, which is then specified to the observations with additive Gaussian noise, additive Laplace noise, and Poisson observations, respectively. Our theoretical results are better than those by existing tensor-based or matrix-based methods. Moreover, the minimax lower bounds are shown to be matched with the derived upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. Numerical examples on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for nonnegative tensor data completion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Gilpin</p>
<p>Abstract: Unmeasured causal forces influence diverse experimental time series, such as the transcription factors that regulate genes, or the descending neurons that steer motor circuits. Combining the theory of skew-product dynamical systems with topological data analysis, we show that simultaneous recurrence events across multiple time series reveal the structure of their shared unobserved driving signal. We introduce a physics-based unsupervised learning algorithm that reconstructs causal drivers by iteratively building a recurrence graph with glass-like structure. As the amount of data increases, a percolation transition on this graph leads to weak ergodicity breaking for random walks -- revealing the shared driver's dynamics, even from strongly-corrupted measurements. We relate reconstruction accuracy to the rate of information transfer from a chaotic driver to the response systems, and we find that effective reconstruction proceeds through gradual approximation of the driver's dynamical attractor. Through extensive benchmarks against classical signal processing and machine learning techniques, we demonstrate our method's ability to extract causal drivers from diverse experimental datasets spanning ecology, genomics, fluid dynamics, and physiology.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training Neural Network (NN) model compression is an attractive approach for deploying large, memory-consuming models on devices with limited memory resources. In this study, we investigate the rate-distortion tradeoff for NN model compression. First, we suggest a Rotation-Invariant Quantization (RIQ) technique that utilizes a single parameter to quantize the entire NN model, yielding a different rate at each layer, i.e., mixed-precision quantization. Then, we prove that our rotation-invariant approach is optimal in terms of compression. We rigorously evaluate RIQ and demonstrate its capabilities on various models and tasks. For example, RIQ facilitates $\times 19.4$ and $\times 52.9$ compression ratios on pre-trained VGG dense and pruned models, respectively, with $<0.4\%$ accuracy degradation.

<p>Abstract: Current defense mechanisms against model poisoning attacks in federated learning (FL) systems have proven effective up to a certain threshold of malicious clients. In this work, we introduce FLANDERS, a novel pre-aggregation filter for FL resilient to large-scale model poisoning attacks, i.e., when malicious clients far exceed legitimate participants. FLANDERS treats the sequence of local models sent by clients in each FL round as a matrix-valued time series. Then, it identifies malicious client updates as outliers in this time series by comparing actual observations with estimates generated by a matrix autoregressive forecasting model maintained by the server. Experiments conducted in several non-iid FL setups show that FLANDERS significantly improves robustness across a wide spectrum of attacks when paired with standard and robust existing aggregation methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo-Kyeong Kim, Hyoung-Kyu Song, Thibault Castells, Shinkook Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation with Stable Diffusion models (SDMs) involves high computing demands due to billion-scale parameters. To enhance efficiency, recent studies have reduced sampling steps and applied network quantization while retaining the original architectures. The lack of architectural reduction attempts may stem from worries over expensive retraining for such massive models. In this work, we uncover the surprising potential of block pruning and feature distillation for low-cost general-purpose T2I. By removing several residual and attention blocks from the U-Net of SDMs, we achieve 30%~50% reduction in model size, MACs, and latency. We show that distillation retraining is effective even under limited resources: using only 13 A100 days and a tiny dataset, our compact models can imitate the original SDMs (v1.4 and v2.1-base with over 6,000 A100 days). Benefiting from the transferred knowledge, our BK-SDMs deliver competitive results on zero-shot MS-COCO against larger multi-billion parameter models. We further demonstrate the applicability of our lightweight backbones in personalized generation and image-to-image translation. Deployment of our models on edge devices attains 4-second inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lyle Regenwetter, Giorgio Giannone, Akash Srivastava, Dan Gutfreund, Faez Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models have recently achieved remarkable success and widespread adoption in society, yet they often struggle to generate realistic and accurate outputs. This challenge extends beyond language and vision into fields like engineering design, where safety-critical engineering standards and non-negotiable physical laws tightly constrain what outputs are considered acceptable. In this work, we introduce a novel training method to guide a generative model toward constraint-satisfying outputs using `negative data' -- examples of what to avoid. Our negative-data generative model (NDGM) formulation easily outperforms classic models, generating 1/6 as many constraint-violating samples using 1/8 as much data in certain problems. It also consistently outperforms other baselines, achieving a balance between constraint satisfaction and distributional similarity that is unsurpassed by any other model in 12 of the 14 problems tested. This widespread superiority is rigorously demonstrated across numerous synthetic tests and real engineering problems, such as ship hull synthesis with hydrodynamic constraints and vehicle design with impact safety constraints. Our benchmarks showcase both the best-in-class performance of our new NDGM formulation and the overall dominance of NDGMs versus classic generative models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex O. Davies, Riku W. Green, Nirav S. Ajmeri, Telmo M. Silva Filho</p>
<p>Abstract: The principal benefit of unsupervised representation learning is that a pre-trained model can be fine-tuned where data or labels are scarce. Existing approaches for graph representation learning are domain specific, maintaining consistent node and edge features across the pre-training and target datasets. This has precluded transfer to multiple domains. We present Topology Only Pre-Training (ToP), a graph pre-training method based on node and edge feature exclusion. We show positive transfer on evaluation datasets from multiple domains, including domains not present in pre-training data, running directly contrary to assumptions made in contemporary works. On 75% of experiments, ToP models perform significantly $p \leq 0.01$ better than a supervised baseline. Performance is significantly positive on 85.7% of tasks when node and edge features are used in fine-tuning. We further show that out-of-domain topologies can produce more useful pre-training than in-domain. Under ToP we show better transfer from non-molecule pre-training, compared to molecule pre-training, on 79% of molecular benchmarks. Against the limited set of other generalist graph models ToP performs strongly, including against models with many orders of magnitude larger. These findings show that ToP opens broad areas of research in both transfer learning on scarcely populated graph domains and in graph foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Yang, Xinting Yang, Chao Yu, Jiayu Chen, Wenbo Ding, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate multi-agent navigation tasks, where multiple agents need to reach initially unassigned goals in a limited time. Classical planning-based methods suffer from expensive computation overhead at each step and offer limited expressiveness for complex cooperation strategies. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a popular approach for addressing this issue. However, RL struggles with low data efficiency and cooperation when directly exploring (nearly) optimal policies in a large exploration space, especially with an increased number of agents(e.g., 10+ agents) or in complex environments (e.g., 3-D simulators). In this paper, we propose the Multi-Agent Scalable Graph-based Planner (MASP), a goal-conditioned hierarchical planner for navigation tasks with a substantial number of agents in the decentralized setting. MASP employs a hierarchical framework to reduce space complexity by decomposing a large exploration space into multiple goal-conditioned subspaces, where a high-level policy assigns agents goals, and a low-level policy navigates agents toward designated goals. For agent cooperation and the adaptation to varying team sizes, we model agents and goals as graphs to better capture their relationship. The high-level policy, the Goal Matcher, leverages a graph-based Self-Encoder and Cross-Encoder to optimize goal assignment by updating the agent and the goal graphs. The low-level policy, the Coordinated Action Executor, introduces the Group Information Fusion to facilitate group division and extract agent relationships across groups, enhancing training efficiency for agent cooperation. The results demonstrate that MASP outperforms RL and planning-based baselines in task efficiency.</p>

We propose four typical forms of calibration attacks: underconfidence, overconfidence, maximum miscalibration, and random confidence attacks, conducted in both black-box and white-box setups. We demonstrate that the attacks are highly effective on both convolutional and attention-based models: with a small number of queries, they seriously skew confidence without changing the predictive performance. Given the potential danger, we further investigate the effectiveness of a wide range of adversarial defence and recalibration methods, including our proposed defences specifically designed for calibration attacks to mitigate the harm. From the ECE and KS scores, we observe that there are still significant limitations in handling calibration attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dedicated study that provides a comprehensive investigation on calibration-focused attacks. We hope this study helps attract more attention to these types of attacks and hence hamper their potential serious damages. To this end, this work also provides detailed analyses to understand the characteristics of the attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/PhenetOs/CalibrationAttack</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Chen, Yingzhou Lu, Nan Hao, Yuanyuan Zhang, Capucine Van Rechem, Jintai Chen, Tianfan Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: The importance of uncertainty quantification is increasingly recognized in the diverse field of machine learning. Accurately assessing model prediction uncertainty can help provide deeper understanding and confidence for researchers and practitioners. This is especially critical in medical diagnosis and drug discovery areas, where reliable predictions directly impact research quality and patient health.
  In this paper, we proposed incorporating uncertainty quantification into clinical trial outcome predictions. Our main goal is to enhance the model's ability to discern nuanced differences, thereby significantly improving its overall performance.
  We have adopted a selective classification approach to fulfill our objective, integrating it seamlessly with the Hierarchical Interaction Network (HINT), which is at the forefront of clinical trial prediction modeling. Selective classification, encompassing a spectrum of methods for uncertainty quantification, empowers the model to withhold decision-making in the face of samples marked by ambiguity or low confidence, thereby amplifying the accuracy of predictions for the instances it chooses to classify. A series of comprehensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating selective classification into clinical trial predictions markedly enhances the model's performance, as evidenced by significant upticks in pivotal metrics such as PR-AUC, F1, ROC-AUC, and overall accuracy.
  Specifically, the proposed method achieved 32.37\%, 21.43\%, and 13.27\% relative improvement on PR-AUC over the base model (HINT) in phase I, II, and III trial outcome prediction, respectively. When predicting phase III, our method reaches 0.9022 PR-AUC scores.
  These findings illustrate the robustness and prospective utility of this strategy within the area of clinical trial predictions, potentially setting a new benchmark in the field.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03768">Corn Yield Prediction Model with Deep Neural Networks for Smallholder Farmer Decision Support System</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chollette C. Olisah, Lyndon Smith, Melvyn Smith, Morolake O. Lawrence, Osita Ojukwu</p>
<p>Abstract: Crop yield prediction has been modeled on the assumption that there is no interaction between weather and soil variables. However, this paper argues that an interaction exists, and it can be finely modelled using the Kendall Correlation coefficient. Given the nonlinearity of the interaction between weather and soil variables, a deep neural network regressor (DNNR) is carefully designed with consideration to the depth, number of neurons of the hidden layers, and the hyperparameters with their optimizations. Additionally, a new metric, the average of absolute root squared error (ARSE) is proposed to combine the strengths of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). With the ARSE metric, the proposed DNNR(s), optimised random forest regressor (RFR) and the extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGBR) achieved impressively small yield errors, 0.0172 t/ha, and 0.0243 t/ha, 0.0001 t/ha, and 0.001 t/ha, respectively. However, the DNNR(s), with changes to the explanatory variables to ensure generalizability to unforeseen data, DNNR(s) performed best. Further analysis reveals that a strong interaction does exist between weather and soil variables. Precisely, yield is observed to increase when precipitation is reduced and silt increased, and vice-versa. However, the degree of decrease or increase is not quantified in this paper. Contrary to existing yield models targeted towards agricultural policies and global food security, the goal of the proposed corn yield model is to empower the smallholder farmer to farm smartly and intelligently, thus the prediction model is integrated into a mobile application that includes education, and a farmer-to-market access module.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet E. Lorasdagi, Mehmet Y. Turali, Suleyman S. Kozat</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate feature selection problem for generic machine learning models. We introduce a novel framework that selects features considering the outcomes of the model. Our framework introduces a novel feature masking approach to eliminate the features during the selection process, instead of completely removing them from the dataset. This allows us to use the same machine learning model during feature selection, unlike other feature selection methods where we need to train the machine learning model again as the dataset has different dimensions on each iteration. We obtain the mask operator using the predictions of the machine learning model, which offers a comprehensive view on the subsets of the features essential for the predictive performance of the model. A variety of approaches exist in the feature selection literature. However, to our knowledge, no study has introduced a training-free framework for a generic machine learning model to select features while considering the importance of the feature subsets as a whole, instead of focusing on the individual features. We demonstrate significant performance improvements on the real-life datasets under different settings using LightGBM and Multi-Layer Perceptron as our machine learning models. The high performance of our General Binary Mask Optimization algorithm stems from its feature masking approach to select features and its flexibility in the number of selected features. The algorithm selects features based on the validation performance of the machine learning model. Hence, the number of selected features is not predetermined and adjusts dynamically to the dataset. Additionally, we openly share the implementation or our code to encourage further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jack Foster, Kyle Fogarty, Stefan Schoepf, Zack Dugue, Cengiz \"Oztireli, Alexandra Brintrup</p>
<p>Abstract: To comply with AI and data regulations, the need to forget private or copyrighted information from trained machine learning models is increasingly important. The key challenge in unlearning is forgetting the necessary data in a timely manner, while preserving model performance. In this work, we address the zero-shot unlearning scenario, whereby an unlearning algorithm must be able to remove data given only a trained model and the data to be forgotten. We explore unlearning from an information theoretic perspective, connecting the influence of a sample to the information gain a model receives by observing it. From this, we derive a simple but principled zero-shot unlearning method based on the geometry of the model. Our approach takes the form of minimising the gradient of a learned function with respect to a small neighbourhood around a target forget point. This induces a smoothing effect, causing forgetting by moving the boundary of the classifier. We explore the intuition behind why this approach can jointly unlearn forget samples while preserving general model performance through a series of low-dimensional experiments. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our method over a range of contemporary benchmarks, verifying that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art performance under the strict constraints of zero-shot unlearning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingzhe Liu, Haitao Mao, Zhikai Chen, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Jiliang Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep graph models (e.g., graph neural networks and graph transformers) have become important techniques for leveraging knowledge across various types of graphs. Yet, the neural scaling laws on graphs, i.e., how the performance of deep graph models changes with model and dataset sizes, have not been systematically investigated, casting doubts on the feasibility of achieving large graph models. To fill this gap, we benchmark many graph datasets from different tasks and make an attempt to establish the neural scaling laws on graphs from both model and data perspectives. The model size we investigated is up to 100 million parameters, and the dataset size investigated is up to 50 million samples. We first verify the validity of such laws on graphs, establishing proper formulations to describe the scaling behaviors. For model scaling, we identify that despite the parameter numbers, the model depth also plays an important role in affecting the model scaling behaviors, which differs from observations in other domains such as CV and NLP. For data scaling, we suggest that the number of graphs can not effectively measure the graph data volume in scaling law since the sizes of different graphs are highly irregular. Instead, we reform the data scaling law with the number of nodes or edges as the metric to address the irregular graph sizes. We further demonstrate that the reformed law offers a unified view of the data scaling behaviors for various fundamental graph tasks including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. This work provides valuable insights into neural scaling laws on graphs, which can serve as an important tool for collecting new graph data and developing large graph models.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07818">Differentially Private Zeroth-Order Methods for Scalable Large Language Model Finetuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Z Liu, J Lou, W Bao, Y Hu, B Li, Z Qin, K Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs fine-tuning and its accompanying privacy concerns, differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs has been widely used to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the design core of DP LLM fine-tuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff among privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit, DP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent inefficiency of SGD.
  In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient. Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD, this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically. First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of the zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory.
  We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in terms of scalability and utility regardless of the class of tasks (compared with DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves $4.5\%$ on SST-5, $5.5\%$ on MNLI with RoBERTa-Large and 9.2\% on CB, 3.9\% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7b when $\epsilon=4$, demonstrates more significant enhancement in performance on more complicated tasks).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasmus Kj{\ae}r H{\o}ier, Christopher Zach</p>
<p>Abstract: The search for ``biologically plausible'' learning algorithms has converged on the idea of representing gradients as activity differences. However, most approaches require a high degree of synchronization (distinct phases during learning) and introduce substantial computational overhead, which raises doubts regarding their biological plausibility as well as their potential utility for neuromorphic computing. Furthermore, they commonly rely on applying infinitesimal perturbations (nudges) to output units, which is impractical in noisy environments. Recently it has been shown that by modelling artificial neurons as dyads with two oppositely nudged compartments, it is possible for a fully local learning algorithm named ``dual propagation'' to bridge the performance gap to backpropagation, without requiring separate learning phases or infinitesimal nudging. However, the algorithm has the drawback that its numerical stability relies on symmetric nudging, which may be restrictive in biological and analog implementations. In this work we first provide a solid foundation for the objective underlying the dual propagation method, which also reveals a surprising connection with adversarial robustness. Second, we demonstrate how dual propagation is related to a particular adjoint state method, which is stable regardless of asymmetric nudging.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12527">The Edge-of-Reach Problem in Offline Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Anya Sims, Cong Lu, Jakob Foerster, Yee Whye Teh</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning aims to train agents from pre-collected datasets. However, this comes with the added challenge of estimating the value of behaviors not covered in the dataset. Model-based methods offer a potential solution by training an approximate dynamics model, which then allows collection of additional synthetic data via rollouts in this model. The prevailing theory treats this approach as online RL in an approximate dynamics model, and any remaining performance gap is therefore understood as being due to dynamics model errors. In this paper, we analyze this assumption and investigate how popular algorithms perform as the learned dynamics model is improved. In contrast to both intuition and theory, if the learned dynamics model is replaced by the true error-free dynamics, existing model-based methods completely fail. This reveals a key oversight: The theoretical foundations assume sampling of full horizon rollouts in the learned dynamics model; however, in practice, the number of model-rollout steps is aggressively reduced to prevent accumulating errors. We show that this truncation of rollouts results in a set of edge-of-reach states at which we are effectively ``bootstrapping from the void.'' This triggers pathological value overestimation and complete performance collapse. We term this the edge-of-reach problem. Based on this new insight, we fill important gaps in existing theory, and reveal how prior model-based methods are primarily addressing the edge-of-reach problem, rather than model-inaccuracy as claimed. Finally, we propose Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL), a simple and robust method that directly addresses the edge-of-reach problem and hence - unlike existing methods - does not fail as the dynamics model is improved.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avi Amalanshu, Yash Sirvi, David I. Inouye</p>
<p>Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is an emergent distributed machine learning paradigm for collaborative learning between clients who have disjoint features of common entities. However, standard VFL lacks fault tolerance, with each participant and connection being a single point of failure. Prior attempts to induce fault tolerance in VFL focus on the scenario of "straggling clients", usually entailing that all messages eventually arrive or that there is an upper bound on the number of late messages. To handle the more general problem of arbitrary crashes, we propose Decoupled VFL (DVFL). To handle training with faults, DVFL decouples training between communication rounds using local unsupervised objectives. By further decoupling label supervision from aggregation, DVFL also enables redundant aggregators. As secondary benefits, DVFL can enhance data efficiency and provides immunity against gradient-based attacks. In this work, we implement DVFL for split neural networks with a self-supervised autoencoder loss. When there are faults, DVFL outperforms the best VFL-based alternative (97.58% vs 96.95% on an MNIST task). Even under perfect conditions, performance is comparable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyuan Yang, Guodong Long, Tao Shen, Jing Jiang, Michael Blumenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning diverse instruction data. Notably, federated foundation models (FedFM) emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data. To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to FedFM for better user preferences alignment. However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications, and conventional methods for test-time distribution shifts in personalized FL are less effective for FedFM due to their failure to adapt to complex distribution shift scenarios and the requirement to train all parameters. To bridge this gap, we refine the setting in FedFM, termed test-time personalization, which aims to learn personalized federated foundation models on clients while effectively handling test-time distribution shifts simultaneously. To address challenges in this setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution, a Federated Dual-Personalizing Adapter (FedDPA) architecture. By co-working with a foundation model, a global adapter and a local adapter jointly tackle the test-time distribution shifts and client-specific personalization. Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism that dynamically integrates the global and local adapters for each test instance during inference, facilitating effective test-time personalization. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19253">Inferring Latent Temporal Sparse Coordination Graph for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Duan, Jie Lu, Junyu Xuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective agent coordination is crucial in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). While agent cooperation can be represented by graph structures, prevailing graph learning methods in MARL are limited. They rely solely on one-step observations, neglecting crucial historical experiences, leading to deficient graphs that foster redundant or detrimental information exchanges. Additionally, high computational demands for action-pair calculations in dense graphs impede scalability. To address these challenges, we propose inferring a Latent Temporal Sparse Coordination Graph (LTS-CG) for MARL. The LTS-CG leverages agents' historical observations to calculate an agent-pair probability matrix, where a sparse graph is sampled from and used for knowledge exchange between agents, thereby simultaneously capturing agent dependencies and relation uncertainty. The computational complexity of this procedure is only related to the number of agents. This graph learning process is further augmented by two innovative characteristics: Predict-Future, which enables agents to foresee upcoming observations, and Infer-Present, ensuring a thorough grasp of the environmental context from limited data. These features allow LTS-CG to construct temporal graphs from historical and real-time information, promoting knowledge exchange during policy learning and effective collaboration. Graph learning and agent training occur simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. Our demonstrated results on the StarCraft II benchmark underscore LTS-CG's superior performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Using the nonlinear shallow water equations as benchmark, we demonstrate that a simulation with the ICON-O ocean model with a 20km resolution that is frequently corrected by a U-net-type neural network can achieve discretization errors of a simulation with 10km resolution. The network, originally developed for image-based super-resolution in post-processing, is trained to compute the difference between solutions on both meshes and is used to correct the coarse mesh every 12h. Our setup is the Galewsky test case, modeling transition of a barotropic instability into turbulent flow. We show that the ML-corrected coarse resolution run correctly maintains a balance flow and captures the transition to turbulence in line with the higher resolution simulation. After 8 day of simulation, the $L_2$-error of the corrected run is similar to a simulation run on the finer mesh. While mass is conserved in the corrected runs, we observe some spurious generation of kinetic energy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Continual learning (CL) provides a framework for training models in ever-evolving environments. Although re-occurrence of previously seen objects or tasks is common in real-world problems, the concept of repetition in the data stream is not often considered in standard benchmarks for CL. Unlike with the rehearsal mechanism in buffer-based strategies, where sample repetition is controlled by the strategy, repetition in the data stream naturally stems from the environment. This report provides a summary of the CLVision challenge at CVPR 2023, which focused on the topic of repetition in class-incremental learning. The report initially outlines the challenge objective and then describes three solutions proposed by finalist teams that aim to effectively exploit the repetition in the stream to learn continually. The experimental results from the challenge highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based solutions that employ multiple versions of similar modules, each trained on different but overlapping subsets of classes. This report underscores the transformative potential of taking a different perspective in CL by employing repetition in the data stream to foster innovative strategy design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soner Aydin, Sinan Yildirim</p>
<p>Abstract: Frequency estimation plays a critical role in many applications involving personal and private categorical data. Such data are often collected sequentially over time, making it valuable to estimate their distribution online while preserving privacy. We propose AdOBEst-LDP, a new algorithm for adaptive, online Bayesian estimation of categorical distributions under local differential privacy (LDP). The key idea behind AdOBEst-LDP is to enhance the utility of future privatized categorical data by leveraging inference from previously collected privatized data. To achieve this, AdOBEst-LDP uses a new adaptive LDP mechanism to collect privatized data. This LDP mechanism constrains its output to a \emph{subset} of categories that `predicts' the next user's data. By adapting the subset selection process to the past privatized data via Bayesian estimation, the algorithm improves the utility of future privatized data. To quantify utility, we explore various well-known information metrics, including (but not limited to) the Fisher information matrix, total variation distance, and information entropy. For Bayesian estimation, we utilize \emph{posterior sampling} through stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, a computationally efficient approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
  We provide a theoretical analysis showing that (i) the posterior distribution of the category probabilities targeted with Bayesian estimation converges to the true probabilities even for approximate posterior sampling, and (ii) AdOBEst-LDP eventually selects the optimal subset for its LDP mechanism with high probability if posterior sampling is performed exactly. We also present numerical results to validate the estimation accuracy of AdOBEst-LDP. Our comparisons show its superior performance against non-adaptive and semi-adaptive competitors across different privacy levels and distributional parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Fan, Zhicheng Ding, Ruixin Huang, Chang Zhou, Xuyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: A classification prediction algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) improved AdaBoost is used to predict virtual reality (VR) user experience. The dataset is randomly divided into training and test sets in the ratio of 7:3.During the training process, the model's loss value decreases from 0.65 to 0.31, which shows that the model gradually reduces the discrepancy between the prediction results and the actual labels, and improves the accuracy and generalisation ability.The final loss value of 0.31 indicates that the model fits the training data well, and is able to make predictions and classifications more accurately. The confusion matrix for the training set shows a total of 177 correct predictions and 52 incorrect predictions, with an accuracy of 77%, precision of 88%, recall of 77% and f1 score of 82%. The confusion matrix for the test set shows a total of 167 correct and 53 incorrect predictions with 75% accuracy, 87% precision, 57% recall and 69% f1 score. In summary, the classification prediction algorithm based on LSTM with improved AdaBoost shows good prediction ability for virtual reality user experience. This study is of great significance to enhance the application of virtual reality technology in user experience. By combining LSTM and AdaBoost algorithms, significant progress has been made in user experience prediction, which not only improves the accuracy and generalisation ability of the model, but also provides useful insights for related research in the field of virtual reality. This approach can help developers better understand user requirements, optimise virtual reality product design, and enhance user satisfaction, promoting the wide application of virtual reality technology in various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sho Sonoda, Yuka Hashimoto, Isao Ishikawa, Masahiro Ikeda</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a constructive universal approximation theorem for learning machines equipped with joint-group-equivariant feature maps, called the joint-equivariant machines, based on the group representation theory. "Constructive" here indicates that the distribution of parameters is given in a closed-form expression known as the ridgelet transform. Joint-group-equivariance encompasses a broad class of feature maps that generalize classical group-equivariance. Particularly, fully-connected networks are not group-equivariant but are joint-group-equivariant. Our main theorem also unifies the universal approximation theorems for both shallow and deep networks. Until this study, the universality of deep networks has been shown in a different manner from the universality of shallow networks, but our results discuss them on common ground. Now we can understand the approximation schemes of various learning machines in a unified manner. As applications, we show the constructive universal approximation properties of four examples: depth-$n$ joint-equivariant machine, depth-$n$ fully-connected network, depth-$n$ group-convolutional network, and a new depth-$2$ network with quadratic forms whose universality has not been known.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training large AI models such as LLMs and DLRMs costs massive GPUs and computing time. The high training cost has become only affordable to big tech companies, meanwhile also causing increasing concerns about the environmental impact. This paper presents CoMERA, a Computing- and Memory-Efficient training method via Rank-Adaptive tensor optimization. CoMERA achieves rank-adaptive tensor-compressed (pre)-training via a multi-objective optimization formulation and improves the training to provide both a high compression ratio and excellent accuracy in the training process. Our optimized numerical computation (e.g., optimized tensorized embedding and tensor-network contractions) and GPU implementation eliminate part of the run-time overhead in the tensorized training on GPU. This leads to, for the first time, $2-3\times$ speedup per training epoch compared with standard training. CoMERA also outperforms the recent GaLore in terms of both memory and computing efficiency. Specifically, CoMERA is $2\times$ faster per training epoch and $9\times$ more memory-efficient than GaLore on a tested six-encoder transformer with single-batch training. Our method also shows $\sim 2\times$ speedup than standard pre-training on a BERT-like code-generation LLM while achieving $4.23\times$ compression ratio in pre-training. With further HPC optimization, CoMERA may reduce the pre-training cost of many other LLMs. An implementation of CoMERA is available at https://github.com/ziyangjoy/CoMERA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Oliveira, Dino Sejdinovic, David Howard, Edwin V. Bonilla</p>
<p>Abstract: The process of calibrating computer models of natural phenomena is essential for applications in the physical sciences, where plenty of domain knowledge can be embedded into simulations and then calibrated against real observations. Current machine learning approaches, however, mostly rely on rerunning simulations over a fixed set of designs available in the observed data, potentially neglecting informative correlations across the design space and requiring a large amount of simulations. Instead, we consider the calibration process from the perspective of Bayesian adaptive experimental design and propose a data-efficient algorithm to run maximally informative simulations within a batch-sequential process. At each round, the algorithm jointly estimates the parameters of the posterior distribution and optimal designs by maximising a variational lower bound of the expected information gain. The simulator is modelled as a sample from a Gaussian process, which allows us to correlate simulations and observed data with the unknown calibration parameters. We show the benefits of our method when compared to related approaches across synthetic and real-data problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the standard approach for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, allowing LLMs to demonstrate remarkable abilities in various tasks. Existing methods work by emulating the preferences at the single decision (turn) level, limiting their capabilities in settings that require planning or multi-turn interactions to achieve a long-term goal. In this paper, we address this issue by developing novel methods for Reinforcement Learning (RL) from preference feedback between two full multi-turn conversations. In the tabular setting, we present a novel mirror-descent-based policy optimization algorithm for the general multi-turn preference-based RL problem, and prove its convergence to Nash equilibrium. To evaluate performance, we create a new environment, Education Dialogue, where a teacher agent guides a student in learning a random topic, and show that a deep RL variant of our algorithm outperforms RLHF baselines. Finally, we show that in an environment with explicit rewards, our algorithm recovers the same performance as a reward-based RL baseline, despite relying solely on a weaker preference signal.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alkis Kalavasis, Amin Karbasi, Grigoris Velegkas, Felix Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We study computational aspects of algorithmic replicability, a notion of stability introduced by Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell [2022]. Motivated by a recent line of work that established strong statistical connections between replicability and other notions of learnability such as online learning, private learning, and SQ learning, we aim to understand better the computational connections between replicability and these learning paradigms. Our first result shows that there is a concept class that is efficiently replicably PAC learnable, but, under standard cryptographic assumptions, no efficient online learner exists for this class. Subsequently, we design an efficient replicable learner for PAC learning parities when the marginal distribution is far from uniform, making progress on a question posed by Impagliazzo et al. [2022]. To obtain this result, we design a replicable lifting framework inspired by Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan [2023] that transforms in a black-box manner efficient replicable PAC learners under the uniform marginal distribution over the Boolean hypercube to replicable PAC learners under any marginal distribution, with sample and time complexity that depends on a certain measure of the complexity of the distribution. Finally, we show that any pure DP learner can be transformed to a replicable one in time polynomial in the accuracy, confidence parameters and exponential in the representation dimension of the underlying hypothesis class.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noga Amit, Shafi Goldwasser, Orr Paradise, Guy Rothblum</p>
<p>Abstract: How can we trust the correctness of a learned model on a particular input of interest? Model accuracy is typically measured *on average* over a distribution of inputs, giving no guarantee for any fixed input. This paper proposes a theoretically-founded solution to this problem: to train *Self-Proving models* that prove the correctness of their output to a verification algorithm $V$ via an Interactive Proof. Self-Proving models satisfy that, with high probability over a random input, the model generates a correct output *and* successfully proves its correctness to $V\!$. The *soundness* property of $V$ guarantees that, for *every* input, no model can convince $V$ of the correctness of an incorrect output. Thus, a Self-Proving model proves correctness of most of its outputs, while *all* incorrect outputs (of any model) are detected by $V$. We devise a generic method for learning Self-Proving models, and we prove convergence bounds under certain assumptions. The theoretical framework and results are complemented by experiments on an arithmetic capability: computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. Our learning method is used to train a Self-Proving transformer that computes the GCD *and* proves the correctness of its answer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chendi Qian, Andrei Manolache, Christopher Morris, Mathias Niepert</p>
<p>Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph-based machine learning. Despite their effectiveness, MPNNs face challenges such as under-reaching and over-squashing, where limited receptive fields and structural bottlenecks hinder information flow in the graph. While graph transformers hold promise in addressing these issues, their scalability is limited due to quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes, rendering them impractical for larger graphs. Here, we propose implicitly rewired message-passing neural networks (IPR-MPNNs), a novel approach that integrates implicit probabilistic graph rewiring into MPNNs. By introducing a small number of virtual nodes, i.e., adding additional nodes to a given graph and connecting them to existing nodes, in a differentiable, end-to-end manner, IPR-MPNNs enable long-distance message propagation, circumventing quadratic complexity. Theoretically, we demonstrate that IPR-MPNNs surpass the expressiveness of traditional MPNNs. Empirically, we validate our approach by showcasing its ability to mitigate under-reaching and over-squashing effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple graph datasets. Notably, IPR-MPNNs outperform graph transformers while maintaining significantly faster computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Cena, Umberto Albertin, Mauro Martini, Silvia Bucci, Marcello Chiaberge</p>
<p>Abstract: The unique challenges posed by the space environment, characterized by extreme conditions and limited accessibility, raise the need for robust and reliable techniques to identify and prevent satellite faults. Fault detection methods in the space sector are required to ensure mission success and to protect valuable assets. In this context, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based fault detection methodology and evaluates its performance on ADAPT (Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed), an Electrical Power System (EPS) dataset, crafted in laboratory by NASA. Our study focuses on the application of a physics-informed (PI) real-valued non-volume preserving (Real NVP) model for fault detection in space systems. The efficacy of this method is systematically compared against other AI approaches such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Autoencoder-based techniques. Results show that our physics-informed approach outperforms existing methods of fault detection, demonstrating its suitability for addressing the unique challenges of satellite EPS sub-system faults. Furthermore, we unveil the competitive advantage of physics-informed loss in AI models to address specific space needs, namely robustness, reliability, and power constraints, crucial for space exploration and satellite missions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayneel Parekh, Pegah Khayatan, Mustafa Shukor, Alasdair Newson, Matthieu Cord</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) combine unimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks. Despite recent advancements towards the interpretability of these models, understanding internal representations of LMMs remains largely a mystery. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the interpretation of LMMs. We propose a dictionary learning based approach, applied to the representation of tokens. The elements of the learned dictionary correspond to our proposed concepts. We show that these concepts are well semantically grounded in both vision and text. Thus we refer to these as ``multi-modal concepts''. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the results of the learnt concepts. We show that the extracted multimodal concepts are useful to interpret representations of test samples. Finally, we evaluate the disentanglement between different concepts and the quality of grounding concepts visually and textually.

<p>Abstract: In a rapidly evolving job market, skill demand forecasting is crucial as it enables policymakers and businesses to anticipate and adapt to changes, ensuring that workforce skills align with market needs, thereby enhancing productivity and competitiveness. Additionally, by identifying emerging skill requirements, it directs individuals towards relevant training and education opportunities, promoting continuous self-learning and development. However, the absence of comprehensive datasets presents a significant challenge, impeding research and the advancement of this field. To bridge this gap, we present Job-SDF, a dataset designed to train and benchmark job-skill demand forecasting models. Based on 10.35 million public job advertisements collected from major online recruitment platforms in China between 2021 and 2023, this dataset encompasses monthly recruitment demand for 2,324 types of skills across 521 companies. Our dataset uniquely enables evaluating skill demand forecasting models at various granularities, including occupation, company, and regional levels. We benchmark a range of models on this dataset, evaluating their performance in standard scenarios, in predictions focused on lower value ranges, and in the presence of structural breaks, providing new insights for further research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haibo Wang, Lutfu S. Sua, Bahram Alidaee</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of global supply chains have led to new challenges spanning various fields, such as supply chain disruptions due to long waiting lines at the ports, material shortages, and inflation. Coupled with the size of supply chains and the availability of vast amounts of data, efforts towards tackling such challenges have led to an increasing interest in applying machine learning methods in many aspects of supply chains. Unlike other solutions, ML techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks, make predictions and approximate optimal solutions faster. This paper presents an automated ML framework to enhance supply chain security by detecting fraudulent activities, predicting maintenance needs, and forecasting material backorders. Using datasets of varying sizes, results show that fraud detection achieves an 88% accuracy rate using sampling methods, machine failure prediction reaches 93.4% accuracy, and material backorder prediction achieves 89.3% accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the performance of these models, with certain supervised techniques like XGBoost and LightGBM reaching up to 100% precision. This research contributes to supply chain security by streamlining data preprocessing, feature selection, model optimization, and inference deployment, addressing critical challenges and boosting operational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> James Atwood, Nino Scherrer, Preethi Lahoti, Ananth Balashankar, Flavien Prost, Ahmad Beirami</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifiers are used throughout industry to enforce policies, ranging from the detection of toxic content to age-appropriate content filtering. While these classifiers serve important functions, it is also essential that they are built in ways that minimize unfair biases for users.
  One such fairness consideration is called group fairness, which desires that different sub-population of users receive equal treatment. This is a well-studied problem in the context of 'classical' classifiers. However, the emergence of prompt-based language model (LM) decision making has created new opportunities to solve text-based classification tasks, and the fairness properties of these new classifiers are not yet well understood. Further, the `remediation toolkit' is incomplete for LM-based decision makers and little is understood about how to improve decision maker group fairness while maintaining classifier performance.
  This work sets out to add more tools to that toolbox. We introduce adaptations of existing effective approaches from the classical classifier fairness to the prompt-based classifier space. We also devise simple methods that take advantage of the new structure of prompt-based decision makers and operate at the prompt level. We compare these approaches empirically on real data. Our results suggest that adaptations of approaches that are effective for classical classifiers remain effective in the LM-based classifier environment. However, there is room for further exploration of prompt-based remediation methods (and other remediation methods that take advantage of LM structure).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grigori Fursin</p>
<p>Abstract: This white paper introduces my educational community initiative to learn how to run AI, ML and other emerging workloads in the most efficient and cost-effective way across diverse models, data sets, software and hardware. This project leverages Collective Mind (CM), virtualized MLOps and DevOps (CM4MLOps), MLPerf benchmarks, and the Collective Knowledge playground (CK), which I have developed in collaboration with the community and MLCommons.
  I created Collective Mind as a small and portable Python package with minimal dependencies, a unified CLI and Python API to help researchers and engineers automate repetitive, tedious, and time-consuming tasks. I also designed CM as a distributed framework, continuously enhanced by the community through the CM4* repositories, which function as the unified interface for organizing and managing various collections of automations and artifacts. For example, CM4MLOps repository includes many automations, also known as CM scripts, to streamline the process of building, running, benchmarking, and optimizing AI, ML, and other workflows across ever-evolving models, data, and systems.
  I donated CK, CM and CM4MLOps to MLCommons to foster collaboration between academia and industry to learn how to co-design more efficient and cost-effective AI systems while capturing and encoding knowledge within Collective Mind, protecting intellectual property, enabling portable skills, and accelerating the transition of the state-of-the-art research into production. My ultimate goal is to collaborate with the community to complete my two-decade journey toward creating self-optimizing software and hardware that can automatically learn how to run any workload in the most efficient and cost-effective manner based on user requirements and constraints such as cost, latency, throughput, accuracy, power consumption, size, and other critical factors.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the space sector, due to environmental conditions and restricted accessibility, robust fault detection methods are imperative for ensuring mission success and safeguarding valuable assets. This work proposes a novel approach leveraging Physics-Informed Real NVP neural networks, renowned for their ability to model complex and high-dimensional distributions, augmented with a self-supervised task based on sensors' data permutation.

The experiments involve various configurations, including pre-training with self-supervision, multi-task learning, and standalone self-supervised training. Results indicate significant performance improvements across all settings. In particular, employing only the self-supervised loss yields the best overall results, suggesting its efficacy in guiding the network to extract relevant features for fault detection. This study presents a promising direction for improving fault detection in space systems and warrants further exploration in other datasets and applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite much work on advanced deep learning and generative modeling techniques for tabular data generation and imputation, traditional methods have continued to win on imputation benchmarks. We herein present UnmaskingTrees, a simple method for tabular imputation (and generation) employing gradient-boosted decision trees which are used to incrementally unmask individual features. This approach offers state-of-the-art performance on imputation, and on generation given training data with missingness; and it has competitive performance on vanilla generation. To solve the conditional generation subproblem, we propose a tabular probabilistic prediction method, BaltoBot, which fits a balanced tree of boosted tree classifiers. Unlike older methods, it requires no parametric assumption on the conditional distribution, accommodating features with multimodal distributions; unlike newer diffusion methods, it offers fast sampling, closed-form density estimation, and flexible handling of discrete variables. We finally consider our two approaches as meta-algorithms, demonstrating in-context learning-based generative modeling with TabPFN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenrui Yu, Qiongxiu Li, Milan Lopuha\"a-Zwakenberg, Mads Gr{\ae}sb{\o}ll Christensen, Richard Heusdens</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm designed to improve data privacy by enabling data to reside at its source, thus embedding privacy as a core consideration in FL architectures, whether centralized or decentralized. Contrasting with recent findings by Pasquini et al., which suggest that decentralized FL does not empirically offer any additional privacy or security benefits over centralized models, our study provides compelling evidence to the contrary. We demonstrate that decentralized FL, when deploying distributed optimization, provides enhanced privacy protection - both theoretically and empirically - compared to centralized approaches. The challenge of quantifying privacy loss through iterative processes has traditionally constrained the theoretical exploration of FL protocols. We overcome this by conducting a pioneering in-depth information-theoretical privacy analysis for both frameworks. Our analysis, considering both eavesdropping and passive adversary models, successfully establishes bounds on privacy leakage. We show information theoretically that the privacy loss in decentralized FL is upper bounded by the loss in centralized FL. Compared to the centralized case where local gradients of individual participants are directly revealed, a key distinction of optimization-based decentralized FL is that the relevant information includes differences of local gradients over successive iterations and the aggregated sum of different nodes' gradients over the network. This information complicates the adversary's attempt to infer private data. To bridge our theoretical insights with practical applications, we present detailed case studies involving logistic regression and deep neural networks. These examples demonstrate that while privacy leakage remains comparable in simpler models, complex models like deep neural networks exhibit lower privacy risks under decentralized FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shenyang Huang, Farimah Poursafaei, Reihaneh Rabbany, Guillaume Rabusseau, Emanuele Rossi</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real world graphs are inherently dynamic, constantly evolving with node and edge additions. These graphs can be represented by temporal graphs, either through a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation, resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical crosspollination between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when combined with UTG training, snapshot-based models can perform competitively with event-based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event-based models during inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms snapshot-based methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate these features into snapshotbased models as well. These findings highlight the importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance of event-based models in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan J. Foster, Adam Block, Dipendra Misra</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to mimic the behavior of an expert in a sequential decision making task by learning from demonstrations, and has been widely applied to robotics, autonomous driving, and autoregressive text generation. The simplest approach to IL, behavior cloning (BC), is thought to incur sample complexity with unfavorable quadratic dependence on the problem horizon, motivating a variety of different online algorithms that attain improved linear horizon dependence under stronger assumptions on the data and the learner's access to the expert.
  We revisit the apparent gap between offline and online IL from a learning-theoretic perspective, with a focus on the realizable/well-specified setting with general policy classes up to and including deep neural networks. Through a new analysis of behavior cloning with the logarithmic loss, we show that it is possible to achieve horizon-independent sample complexity in offline IL whenever (i) the range of the cumulative payoffs is controlled, and (ii) an appropriate notion of supervised learning complexity for the policy class is controlled. Specializing our results to deterministic, stationary policies, we show that the gap between offline and online IL is smaller than previously thought: (i) it is possible to achieve linear dependence on horizon in offline IL under dense rewards (matching what was previously only known to be achievable in online IL); and (ii) without further assumptions on the policy class, online IL cannot improve over offline IL with the logarithmic loss, even in benign MDPs. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on standard RL tasks and autoregressive language generation to validate the practical relevance of our findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather prediction research is growing rapidly and has shown to be competitive with the advanced dynamic numerical weather prediction models. However, research combining AI-based weather prediction models with data assimilation remains limited partially because long-term sequential data assimilation cycles are required to evaluate data assimilation systems. This study proposes using ensemble data assimilation for diagnosing AI-based weather prediction models, and marked the first successful implementation of ensemble Kalman filter with AI-based weather prediction models. Our experiments with an AI-based model ClimaX demonstrated that the ensemble data assimilation cycled stably for the AI-based weather prediction model using covariance inflation and localization techniques within the ensemble Kalman filter. While ClimaX showed some limitations in capturing flow-dependent error covariance compared to dynamical models, the AI-based ensemble forecasts provided reasonable and beneficial error covariance in sparsely observed regions. In addition, ensemble data assimilation revealed that error growth based on ensemble ClimaX predictions was weaker than that of dynamical NWP models, leading to higher inflation factors. A series of experiments demonstrated that ensemble data assimilation can be used to diagnose properties of AI weather prediction models such as physical consistency and accurate error growth representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of e-commerce and urbanization has significantly intensified delivery operations in urban areas, boosting the volume and complexity of delivery demand. Data-driven predictive methods, especially those utilizing machine learning techniques, have emerged to handle these complexities in urban delivery demand management problems. One particularly pressing issue that has yet to be sufficiently addressed is the joint estimation and prediction of city-wide delivery demand, as well as the generalization of the model to new cities. To this end, we formulate this problem as a transferable graph-based spatiotemporal learning task. First, an individual-collective message-passing neural network model is formalized to capture the interaction between demand patterns of associated regions. Second, by exploiting recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we extract general geospatial knowledge encodings from the unstructured locational data using the embedding generated by LLMs. Last, to encourage the cross-city generalization of the model, we integrate the encoding into the demand predictor in a transferable way. Comprehensive empirical evaluation results on two real-world delivery datasets, including eight cities in China and the US, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, efficiency, and transferability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaijia Xu, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) is an emerging field that seeks to design neural networks that mimic classical algorithmic computations. Today, graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in neural algorithmic reasoners due to their message passing framework and permutation equivariance. In this extended abstract, we challenge this design choice, and replace the equivariant aggregation function with a recurrent neural network. While seemingly counter-intuitive, this approach has appropriate grounding when nodes have a natural ordering -- and this is the case frequently in established reasoning benchmarks like CLRS-30. Indeed, our recurrent NAR (RNAR) model performs very strongly on such tasks, while handling many others gracefully. A notable achievement of RNAR is its decisive state-of-the-art result on the Heapsort and Quickselect tasks, both deemed as a significant challenge for contemporary neural algorithmic reasoners -- especially the latter, where RNAR achieves a mean micro-F1 score of 87%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas R. Naujoks, Aleksander Krasowski, Moritz Weckbecker, Thomas Wiegand, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Ren\'e P. Klausen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/aleks-krasowski/PINNfluence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panayiotis Christou, Shichu Chen, Xupeng Chen, Parijat Dube</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability.
  We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results. This work sets a new benchmark for time-series forecasting and lays the groundwork for future research in scalable, high-performance forecasting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Li, Zihan Chen, Kai Fong Ernest Chong, Bikramjit Das, Tony Q. S. Quek, Howard H. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging over-the-air computations for model aggregation is an effective approach to cope with the communication bottleneck in federated edge learning. By exploiting the superposition properties of multi-access channels, this approach facilitates an integrated design of communication and computation, thereby enhancing system privacy while reducing implementation costs. However, the inherent electromagnetic interference in radio channels often exhibits heavy-tailed distributions, giving rise to exceptionally strong noise in globally aggregated gradients that can significantly deteriorate the training performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient clipping method, termed Median Anchored Clipping (MAC), to combat the detrimental effects of heavy-tailed noise. We also derive analytical expressions for the convergence rate of model training with analog over-the-air federated learning under MAC, which quantitatively demonstrates the effect of MAC on training performance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAC algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of heavy-tailed noise, hence substantially enhancing system robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caleb Ju, Guanghui Lan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel termination criterion, termed the advantage gap function, for finite state and action Markov decision processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating this advantage gap function into the design of step size rules and deriving a new linear rate of convergence that is independent of the stationary state distribution of the optimal policy, we demonstrate that policy gradient methods can solve MDPs in strongly-polynomial time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong convergence properties have been established for policy gradient methods. Moreover, in the stochastic setting, where only stochastic estimates of policy gradients are available, we show that the advantage gap function provides close approximations of the optimality gap for each individual state and exhibits a sublinear rate of convergence at every state. The advantage gap function can be easily estimated in the stochastic case, and when coupled with easily computable upper bounds on policy values, they provide a convenient way to validate the solutions generated by policy gradient methods. Therefore, our developments offer a principled and computable measure of optimality for RL, whereas current practice tends to rely on algorithm-to-algorithm or baselines comparisons with no certificate of optimality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM (p-value $<0.01$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01639">Moral Alignment for LLM Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizaveta Tennant, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.
  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.
  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyungmin Kim, Davide Corsi, Andoni Rodriguez, JB Lanier, Benjami Parellada, Pierre Baldi, Cesar Sanchez, Roy Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, it remains vulnerable to occasional catastrophic failures without additional safeguards. An effective solution to prevent these failures is to use a shield that validates and adjusts the agent's actions to ensure compliance with a provided set of safety specifications. For real-world robotic domains, it is essential to define safety specifications over continuous state and action spaces to accurately account for system dynamics and compute new actions that minimally deviate from the agent's original decision. In this paper, we present the first shielding approach specifically designed to ensure the satisfaction of safety requirements in continuous state and action spaces, making it suitable for practical robotic applications. Our method builds upon realizability, an essential property that confirms the shield will always be able to generate a safe action for any state in the environment. We formally prove that realizability can be verified for stateful shields, enabling the incorporation of non-Markovian safety requirements, such as loop avoidance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ensuring safety without compromising the policy's success rate by applying it to a navigation problem and a multi-agent particle environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josiah C. Kratz, Jacob Adamczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Many organisms and cell types, from bacteria to cancer cells, exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt to fluctuating environments. Additionally, cells can leverage memory of past environments to better survive previously-encountered stressors. From a control perspective, this adaptability poses significant challenges in driving cell populations toward extinction, and is thus an open question with great clinical significance. In this work, we focus on drug dosing in cell populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity. For specific dynamical models switching between resistant and susceptible states, exact solutions are known. However, when the underlying system parameters are unknown, and for complex memory-based systems, obtaining the optimal solution is currently intractable. To address this challenge, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to identify informed dosing strategies to control cell populations evolving under novel non-Markovian dynamics. We find that model-free deep RL is able to recover exact solutions and control cell populations even in the presence of long-range temporal dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sehun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) captures the heart's electrical signals, offering valuable information for diagnosing cardiac conditions. However, the scarcity of labeled data makes it challenging to fully leverage supervised learning in medical domain. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, enabling models to learn from unlabeled data and uncover meaningful patterns. In this paper, we show that masked modeling in the latent space can be a powerful alternative to existing self-supervised methods in the ECG domain. We introduce ECG-JEPA, a SSL model for 12-lead ECG analysis that learns semantic representations of ECG data by predicting in the hidden latent space, bypassing the need to reconstruct raw signals. This approach offers several advantages in the ECG domain: (1) it avoids producing unnecessary details, such as noise, which is common in ECG; and (2) it addresses the limitations of na\"ive L2 loss between raw signals. Another key contribution is the introduction of Cross-Pattern Attention (CroPA), a specialized masked attention mechanism tailored for 12-lead ECG data. ECG-JEPA is trained on the union of several open ECG datasets, totaling approximately 180,000 samples, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks including ECG classification and feature prediction.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenghao Xu, Yuqing Wang, Tuo Zhao, Rachel Ward, Molei Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the convergence rate of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization, which is a canonical nonconvex optimization problem. Specifically, given a rank-$r$ matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, we prove that gradient descent (GD) can find a pair of $\epsilon$-optimal solutions $\mathbf{X}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ and $\mathbf{Y}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, where $d\geq r$, satisfying $\lVert\mathbf{X}_T\mathbf{Y}_T^\top-\mathbf{A}\rVert_\mathrm{F}\leq\epsilon\lVert\mathbf{A}\rVert_\mathrm{F}$ in $T=O(\kappa^2\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ iterations with high probability, where $\kappa$ denotes the condition number of $\mathbf{A}$. Furthermore, we prove that Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) attains an iteration complexity of $O(\kappa\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, which is the best-known bound of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization. Different from small balanced random initialization in the existing literature, we adopt an unbalanced initialization, where $\mathbf{X}_0$ is large and $\mathbf{Y}_0$ is $0$. Moreover, our initialization and analysis can be further extended to linear neural networks, where we prove that NAG can also attain an accelerated linear convergence rate. In particular, we only require the width of the network to be greater than or equal to the rank of the output label matrix. In contrast, previous results achieving the same rate require excessive widths that additionally depend on the condition number and the rank of the input data matrix.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a new class of adaptive non-linear autoregressive (Nlar) models incorporating the concept of momentum, which dynamically estimate both the learning rates and momentum as the number of iterations increases. In our method, the growth of the gradients is controlled using a scaling (clipping) function, leading to stable convergence. Within this framework, we propose three distinct estimators for learning rates and provide theoretical proof of their convergence. We further demonstrate how these estimators underpin the development of effective Nlar optimizers. The performance of the proposed estimators and optimizers is rigorously evaluated through extensive experiments across several datasets and a reinforcement learning environment. The results highlight two key features of the Nlar optimizers: robust convergence despite variations in underlying parameters, including large initial learning rates, and strong adaptability with rapid convergence during the initial epochs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Gracyk</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture by up to 25% reduction in out-of-distribution (OOD) error and potentially greater. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, average-reward MDPs have remained largely unexplored in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, with the majority of RL-based efforts having been allocated to episodic and discounted MDPs. In this work, we study a unique structural property of average-reward MDPs and utilize it to introduce Reward-Extended Differential (or RED) reinforcement learning: a novel RL framework that can be used to effectively and efficiently solve various subtasks simultaneously in the average-reward setting. We introduce a family of RED learning algorithms for prediction and control, including proven-convergent algorithms for the tabular case. We then showcase the power of these algorithms by demonstrating how they can be used to learn a policy that optimizes, for the first time, the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) risk measure in a fully-online manner, without the use of an explicit bi-level optimization scheme or an augmented state-space.</p>

Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators.

<p>Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woosung Koh, Wonbeen Oh, Siyeol Kim, Suhin Shin, Hyeongjin Kim, Jaein Jang, Junghyun Lee, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. For compute-optimal training, we find that perplexity and gradient data selection require training-to-selection model size ratios of 5x and 10x, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saleh Ashkboos, Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan Alizadeh, Mohammad Hossein Sekhavat, Moin Nabi, Mehrdad Farajtabar, Fartash Faghri</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) dominate the AI landscape, Small-scale large Language Models (SLMs) are gaining attention due to cost and efficiency demands from consumers. However, there is limited research on the training behavior and computational requirements of SLMs. In this study, we explore the computational bottlenecks of training SLMs (up to 2B parameters) by examining the effects of various hyperparameters and configurations, including GPU type, batch size, model size, communication protocol, attention type, and the number of GPUs. We assess these factors on popular cloud services using metrics such as loss per dollar and tokens per second. Our findings aim to support the broader adoption and optimization of language model training for low-resource AI research institutes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ya-Wei Eileen Lin, Ronald R. Coifman, Gal Mishne, Ronen Talmon</p>
<p>Abstract: Finding meaningful distances between high-dimensional data samples is an important scientific task. To this end, we propose a new tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD) for high-dimensional data with two key aspects. First, our TWD is specifically designed for data with a latent feature hierarchy, i.e., the features lie in a hierarchical space, in contrast to the usual focus on embedding samples in hyperbolic space. Second, while the conventional use of TWD is to speed up the computation of the Wasserstein distance, we use its inherent tree as a means to learn the latent feature hierarchy. The key idea of our method is to embed the features into a multi-scale hyperbolic space using diffusion geometry and then present a new tree decoding method by establishing analogies between the hyperbolic embedding and trees. We show that our TWD computed based on data observations provably recovers the TWD defined with the latent feature hierarchy and that its computation is efficient and scalable. We showcase the usefulness of the proposed TWD in applications to word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, demonstrating its advantages over existing TWDs and methods based on pre-trained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junshu Sun, Chenxue Yang, Xiangyang Ji, Qingming Huang, Shuhui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Message passing plays a vital role in graph neural networks (GNNs) for effective feature learning. However, the over-reliance on input topology diminishes the efficacy of message passing and restricts the ability of GNNs. Despite efforts to mitigate the reliance, existing study encounters message-passing bottlenecks or high computational expense problems, which invokes the demands for flexible message passing with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic message-passing mechanism for GNNs. It projects graph nodes and learnable pseudo nodes into a common space with measurable spatial relations between them. With nodes moving in the space, their evolving relations facilitate flexible pathway construction for a dynamic message-passing process. Associating pseudo nodes to input graphs with their measured relations, graph nodes can communicate with each other intermediately through pseudo nodes under linear complexity. We further develop a GNN model named $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ based on our dynamic message-passing mechanism. $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ employs a single recurrent layer to recursively generate the displacements of nodes and construct optimal dynamic pathways. Evaluation on eighteen benchmarks demonstrates the superior performance of $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ over popular GNNs. $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ successfully scales to large-scale benchmarks and requires significantly fewer parameters for graph classification with the shared recurrent layer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Yixiang Dai, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Mesana, Cl\'ement B\'enesse, Hadrien Lautraite, Gilles Caporossi, S\'ebastien Gambs</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce WaKA (Wasserstein K-nearest-neighbors Attribution), a novel attribution method that leverages principles from the LiRA (Likelihood Ratio Attack) framework and k-nearest neighbors classifiers (k-NN). WaKA efficiently measures the contribution of individual data points to the model's loss distribution, analyzing every possible k-NN that can be constructed using the training set, without requiring to sample subsets of the training set. WaKA is versatile and can be used a posteriori as a membership inference attack (MIA) to assess privacy risks or a priori for privacy influence measurement and data valuation. Thus, WaKA can be seen as bridging the gap between data attribution and membership inference attack (MIA) by providing a unified framework to distinguish between a data point's value and its privacy risk. For instance, we have shown that self-attribution values are more strongly correlated with the attack success rate than the contribution of a point to the model generalization. WaKA's different usage were also evaluated across diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating performance very close to LiRA when used as an MIA on k-NN classifiers, but with greater computational efficiency. Additionally, WaKA shows greater robustness than Shapley Values for data minimization tasks (removal or addition) on imbalanced datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: When learning an input-output mapping from very few examples, is it better to first infer a latent function that explains the examples, or is it better to directly predict new test outputs, e.g. using a neural network? We study this question on ARC by training neural models for induction (inferring latent functions) and transduction (directly predicting the test output for a given test input). We train on synthetically generated variations of Python programs that solve ARC training tasks. We find inductive and transductive models solve different kinds of test problems, despite having the same training problems and sharing the same neural architecture: Inductive program synthesis excels at precise computations, and at composing multiple concepts, while transduction succeeds on fuzzier perceptual concepts. Ensembling them approaches human-level performance on ARC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanishq Kumar, Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan, Venkatesh N. Murthy, Samuel J. Gershman</p>
<p>Abstract: Does learning of task-relevant representations stop when behavior stops changing? Motivated by recent theoretical advances in machine learning and the intuitive observation that human experts continue to learn from practice even after mastery, we hypothesize that task-specific representation learning can continue, even when behavior plateaus. In a novel reanalysis of recently published neural data, we find evidence for such learning in posterior piriform cortex of mice following continued training on a task, long after behavior saturates at near-ceiling performance ("overtraining"). This learning is marked by an increase in decoding accuracy from piriform neural populations and improved performance on held-out generalization tests. We demonstrate that class representations in cortex continue to separate during overtraining, so that examples that were incorrectly classified at the beginning of overtraining can abruptly be correctly classified later on, despite no changes in behavior during that time. We hypothesize this hidden yet rich learning takes the form of approximate margin maximization; we validate this and other predictions in the neural data, as well as build and interpret a simple synthetic model that recapitulates these phenomena. We conclude by showing how this model of late-time feature learning implies an explanation for the empirical puzzle of overtraining reversal in animal learning, where task-specific representations are more robust to particular task changes because the learned features can be reused.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanishq Kumar, Zachary Ankner, Benjamin F. Spector, Blake Bordelon, Niklas Muennighoff, Mansheej Paul, Cengiz Pehlevan, Christopher R\'e, Aditi Raghunathan</p>
<p>Abstract: Low precision training and inference affect both the quality and cost of language models, but current scaling laws do not account for this. In this work, we devise "precision-aware" scaling laws for both training and inference. We propose that training in lower precision reduces the model's "effective parameter count," allowing us to predict the additional loss incurred from training in low precision and post-train quantization. For inference, we find that the degradation introduced by post-training quantization increases as models are trained on more data, eventually making additional pretraining data actively harmful. For training, our scaling laws allow us to predict the loss of a model with different parts in different precisions, and suggest that training larger models in lower precision may be compute optimal. We unify the scaling laws for post and pretraining quantization to arrive at a single functional form that predicts degradation from training and inference in varied precisions. We fit on over 465 pretraining runs and validate our predictions on model sizes up to 1.7B parameters trained on up to 26B tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bo Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Jiangxuan Long, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Characterizing the express power of the Transformer architecture is critical to understanding its capacity limits and scaling law. Recent works provide the circuit complexity bounds to Transformer-like architecture. On the other hand, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has emerged as a crucial technique in modern large language models, offering superior performance in capturing positional information compared to traditional position embeddings, which shows great potential in application prospects, particularly for the long context scenario. Empirical evidence also suggests that $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architectures demonstrate greater generalization capabilities compared to conventional Transformer models. In this work, we establish a circuit complexity bound for Transformers with $\mathsf{RoPE}$ attention. Our key contribution is that we show that unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision, $O(1)$ layers, hidden dimension $d \leq O(n)$ cannot solve the Arithmetic formula evaluation problem or the Boolean formula value problem. This result significantly demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the expressivity of the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architecture, although it achieves giant empirical success. Our theoretical result not only establishes the complexity bound but also may instruct further work on the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taha Bouhsine</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a yat-product-powered neural network, the Neural Matter Network (NMN), a breakthrough in deep learning that achieves non-linear pattern recognition without activation functions. Our key innovation relies on the yat-product and yat-product, which naturally induces non-linearity by projecting inputs into a pseudo-metric space, eliminating the need for traditional activation functions while maintaining only a softmax layer for final class probability distribution. This approach simplifies network architecture and provides unprecedented transparency into the network's decision-making process. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation across different datasets demonstrates that NMN consistently outperforms traditional MLPs. The results challenge the assumption that separate activation functions are necessary for effective deep-learning models. The implications of this work extend beyond immediate architectural benefits, by eliminating intermediate activation functions while preserving non-linear capabilities, yat-MLP establishes a new paradigm for neural network design that combines simplicity with effectiveness. Most importantly, our approach provides unprecedented insights into the traditionally opaque "black-box" nature of neural networks, offering a clearer understanding of how these models process and classify information.</p>

The experiment tested and compared the reasoning time, correctness score and chain of thought length of this model and o1 Preview in solving the linear algebra test questions of MIT OpenCourseWare. The results show that GiantRabbit's reasoning time and chain of thought length are significantly lower than o1 Preview. It verifies the feasibility of sparse attention mechanism for optimizing chain of thought reasoning.

<p>Abstract: InvestESG is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark designed to study the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure mandates on corporate climate investments. Supported by both PyTorch and JAX implementation, the benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment decisions, in a scalable and hardware-accelerated manner. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in mitigation, even without investor involvement. Our findings align with empirical research using real-world data, highlighting MARL's potential to inform policy by providing insights into large-scale socio-economic challenges through efficient testing of alternative policy and market designs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mangroves play a crucial role in maintaining coastal ecosystem health and protecting biodiversity. Therefore, continuous mapping of mangroves is essential for understanding their dynamics. Earth observation imagery typically provides a cost-effective way to monitor mangrove dynamics. However, there is a lack of regional studies on mangrove areas in the UAE. This study utilizes the UNet++ deep learning model combined with Sentinel-2 multispectral data and manually annotated labels to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of densely distributed mangroves (coverage greater than 70%) in the UAE from 2017 to 2024, achieving an mIoU of 87.8% on the validation set. Results show that the total mangrove area in the UAE in 2024 was approximately 9,142.21 hectares, an increase of 2,061.33 hectares compared to 2017, with carbon sequestration increasing by approximately 194,383.42 tons, equivalent to fixing about 713,367.36 tons of carbon dioxide. Abu Dhabi has the largest mangrove area and plays a dominant role in the UAE's mangrove growth, increasing by 1,855.6 hectares between 2017-2024, while other emirates have also contributed to mangrove expansion through stable and sustainable growth in mangrove areas. This comprehensive growth pattern reflects the collective efforts of all emirates in mangrove restoration.</p>

In this paper, we provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which we find surprisingly do not always improve regression performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Xie, Weijie Zheng, Hanxun Huang, Guangnan Ye, Xingjun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Yu Chen, Tao Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: We present APT, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM)-driven framework that enables autonomous agents to construct complex and creative structures within the Minecraft environment. Unlike previous approaches that primarily concentrate on skill-based open-world tasks or rely on image-based diffusion models for generating voxel-based structures, our method leverages the intrinsic spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By employing chain-of-thought decomposition along with multimodal inputs, the framework generates detailed architectural layouts and blueprints that the agent can execute under zero-shot or few-shot learning scenarios. Our agent incorporates both memory and reflection modules to facilitate lifelong learning, adaptive refinement, and error correction throughout the building process. To rigorously evaluate the agent's performance in this emerging research area, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark consisting of diverse construction tasks designed to test creativity, spatial reasoning, adherence to in-game rules, and the effective integration of multimodal instructions. Experimental results using various GPT-based LLM backends and agent configurations demonstrate the agent's capacity to accurately interpret extensive instructions involving numerous items, their positions, and orientations. The agent successfully produces complex structures complete with internal functionalities such as Redstone-powered systems. A/B testing indicates that the inclusion of a memory module leads to a significant increase in performance, emphasizing its role in enabling continuous learning and the reuse of accumulated experience. Additionally, the agent's unexpected emergence of scaffolding behavior highlights the potential of future LLM-driven agents to utilize subroutine planning and leverage the emergence ability of LLMs to autonomously develop human-like problem-solving techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benedikt Stroebl, Sayash Kapoor, Arvind Narayanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has generated hope that inference scaling could allow weaker language models to match or exceed the accuracy of stronger models, such as by repeatedly sampling solutions to a coding problem until it passes unit tests. The central thesis of this paper is that there is no free lunch for inference scaling: indefinite accuracy improvement through resampling can only be realized if the "verifier" (in this case, a set of unit tests) is perfect. When the verifier is imperfect, as it almost always is in domains such as reasoning or coding (for example, unit tests have imperfect coverage), there is a nonzero probability of false positives: incorrect solutions that pass the verifier. Resampling cannot decrease this probability, so it imposes an upper bound to the accuracy of resampling-based inference scaling even with an infinite compute budget. We find that there is a very strong correlation between the model's single-sample accuracy (i.e. accuracy without unit tests) and its false positive rate on coding benchmarks HumanEval and MBPP, whose unit tests have limited coverage. Therefore, no amount of inference scaling of weaker models can enable them to match the single-sample accuracy of a sufficiently strong model (Fig. 1a). When we consider that false positives have a negative utility compared to abstaining from producing a solution, it bends the inference scaling curve further downward. Empirically, we find that the optimal number of samples can be less than 10 under realistic assumptions (Fig. 1b). Finally, we show that beyond accuracy, false positives may have other undesirable qualities, such as poor adherence to coding style conventions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanxue Dong, Maria De-arteaga, Maytal Saar-Tsechansky</p>
<p>Abstract: Biased human decisions have consequential impacts across various domains, yielding unfair treatment of individuals and resulting in suboptimal outcomes for organizations and society. In recognition of this fact, organizations regularly design and deploy interventions aimed at mitigating these biases. However, measuring human decision biases remains an important but elusive task. Organizations are frequently concerned with mistaken decisions disproportionately affecting one group. In practice, however, this is typically not possible to assess due to the scarcity of a gold standard: a label that indicates what the correct decision would have been. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based framework to assess bias in human-generated decisions when gold standard labels are scarce. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of our method over existing alternatives. This proposed methodology establishes a foundation for transparency in human decision-making, carrying substantial implications for managerial duties, and offering potential for alleviating algorithmic biases when human decisions are used as labels to train algorithms.</p>

Therefore methods requiring only partly labeled data (semi-supervised) or no labeling at all (unsupervised methods) have been applied more regularly. Anomaly detection is one possible methodology that is able to leverage semi-supervised and unsupervised methods to handle medical imaging tasks like classification and segmentation. This paper uses a semi-exhaustive literature review of relevant anomaly detection papers in medical imaging to cluster into applications, highlight important results, establish lessons learned and give further advice on how to approach anomaly detection in medical imaging. The qualitative analysis is based on google scholar and 4 different search terms, resulting in 120 different analysed papers. The main results showed that the current research is mostly motivated by reducing the need for labelled data. Also, the successful and substantial amount of research in the brain MRI domain shows the potential for applications in further domains like OCT and chest X-ray.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathieu Dagr\'eou, Pierre Ablin, Samuel Vaiter, Thomas Moreau</p>
<p>Abstract: Bilevel optimization, the problem of minimizing a value function which involves the arg-minimum of another function, appears in many areas of machine learning. In a large scale empirical risk minimization setting where the number of samples is huge, it is crucial to develop stochastic methods, which only use a few samples at a time to progress. However, computing the gradient of the value function involves solving a linear system, which makes it difficult to derive unbiased stochastic estimates. To overcome this problem we introduce a novel framework, in which the solution of the inner problem, the solution of the linear system, and the main variable evolve at the same time. These directions are written as a sum, making it straightforward to derive unbiased estimates. The simplicity of our approach allows us to develop global variance reduction algorithms, where the dynamics of all variables is subject to variance reduction. We demonstrate that SABA, an adaptation of the celebrated SAGA algorithm in our framework, has $O(\frac1T)$ convergence rate, and that it achieves linear convergence under Polyak-Lojasciewicz assumption. This is the first stochastic algorithm for bilevel optimization that verifies either of these properties. Numerical experiments validate the usefulness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Thyroid cancer is currently the fifth most common malignancy diagnosed in women. Since differentiation of cancer sub-types is important for treatment and current, manual methods are time consuming and subjective, automatic computer-aided differentiation of cancer types is crucial. Manual differentiation of thyroid cancer is based on tissue sections, analysed by pathologists using histological features. Due to the enormous size of gigapixel whole slide images, holistic classification using deep learning methods is not feasible. Patch based multiple instance learning approaches, combined with aggregations such as bag-of-words, is a common approach. This work's contribution is to extend a patch based state-of-the-art method by generating and combining feature vectors of three different patch resolutions and analysing three distinct ways of combining them. The results showed improvements in one of the three multi-scale approaches, while the others led to decreased scores. This provides motivation for analysis and discussion of the individual approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Yu, Chenyang Si, Pan Zhou, Mi Luo, Yichen Zhou, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: MetaFormer, the abstracted architecture of Transformer, has been found to play a significant role in achieving competitive performance. In this paper, we further explore the capacity of MetaFormer, again, without focusing on token mixer design: we introduce several baseline models under MetaFormer using the most basic or common mixers, and summarize our observations as follows: (1) MetaFormer ensures solid lower bound of performance. By merely adopting identity mapping as the token mixer, the MetaFormer model, termed IdentityFormer, achieves >80% accuracy on ImageNet-1K. (2) MetaFormer works well with arbitrary token mixers. When specifying the token mixer as even a random matrix to mix tokens, the resulting model RandFormer yields an accuracy of >81%, outperforming IdentityFormer. Rest assured of MetaFormer's results when new token mixers are adopted. (3) MetaFormer effortlessly offers state-of-the-art results. With just conventional token mixers dated back five years ago, the models instantiated from MetaFormer already beat state of the art. (a) ConvFormer outperforms ConvNeXt. Taking the common depthwise separable convolutions as the token mixer, the model termed ConvFormer, which can be regarded as pure CNNs, outperforms the strong CNN model ConvNeXt. (b) CAFormer sets new record on ImageNet-1K. By simply applying depthwise separable convolutions as token mixer in the bottom stages and vanilla self-attention in the top stages, the resulting model CAFormer sets a new record on ImageNet-1K: it achieves an accuracy of 85.5% at 224x224 resolution, under normal supervised training without external data or distillation. In our expedition to probe MetaFormer, we also find that a new activation, StarReLU, reduces 71% FLOPs of activation compared with GELU yet achieves better performance. We expect StarReLU to find great potential in MetaFormer-like models alongside other neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathieu Dagr\'eou, Thomas Moreau, Samuel Vaiter, Pierre Ablin</p>
<p>Abstract: Bilevel optimization problems, which are problems where two optimization problems are nested, have more and more applications in machine learning. In many practical cases, the upper and the lower objectives correspond to empirical risk minimization problems and therefore have a sum structure. In this context, we propose a bilevel extension of the celebrated SARAH algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}((n+m)^{\frac12}\varepsilon^{-1})$ oracle calls to achieve $\varepsilon$-stationarity with $n+m$ the total number of samples, which improves over all previous bilevel algorithms. Moreover, we provide a lower bound on the number of oracle calls required to get an approximate stationary point of the objective function of the bilevel problem. This lower bound is attained by our algorithm, making it optimal in terms of sample complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Ghafourian, Bilgesu Sumer, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Julian Fierrez, Ruben Tolosana, Aythami Moralez, Els Kindt</p>
<p>Abstract: Biometric recognition as a unique, hard-to-forge, and efficient way of identification and verification has become an indispensable part of the current digital world. The fast evolution of this technology has been a strong incentive for integrating it into many applications. Meanwhile, blockchain, the very attractive decentralized ledger technology, has been widely received both by the research and industry in the past years and it is being increasingly deployed nowadays in many different applications, such as money transfer, IoT, healthcare, or logistics. Recently, researchers have started to speculate what would be the pros and cons and what would be the best applications when these two technologies cross paths. This paper provides a survey of technical literature research on the combination of blockchain and biometrics and includes a first legal analysis of this integration to shed light on challenges and potentials. While this combination is still in its infancy and a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic understanding of blockchains applicability in the biometric sector. This study demonstrates that combining blockchain and biometrics would be beneficial for novel applications in biometrics such as the PKI mechanism, distributed trusted service, and identity management. However, blockchain networks at their current stage are not efficient and economical for real-time applications. From a legal point of view, the allocation of accountability remains a main issue, while other difficulties remain, such as conducting a proper Data Protection Impact Assessment. Finally, it supplies technical and legal recommendations to reap the benefits and mitigate the risks of the combination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianqing Fan, Cong Fang, Yihong Gu, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper considers a multi-environment linear regression model in which data from multiple experimental settings are collected. The joint distribution of the response variable and covariates may vary across different environments, yet the conditional expectations of $y$ given the unknown set of important variables are invariant. Such a statistical model is related to the problem of endogeneity, causal inference, and transfer learning. The motivation behind it is illustrated by how the goals of prediction and attribution are inherent in estimating the true parameter and the important variable set. We construct a novel environment invariant linear least squares (EILLS) objective function, a multi-environment version of linear least-squares regression that leverages the above conditional expectation invariance structure and heterogeneity among different environments to determine the true parameter. Our proposed method is applicable without any additional structural knowledge and can identify the true parameter under a near-minimal identification condition. We establish non-asymptotic $\ell_2$ error bounds on the estimation error for the EILLS estimator in the presence of spurious variables. Moreover, we further show that the $\ell_0$ penalized EILLS estimator can achieve variable selection consistency in high-dimensional regimes. These non-asymptotic results demonstrate the sample efficiency of the EILLS estimator and its capability to circumvent the curse of endogeneity in an algorithmic manner without any prior structural knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to realize statistically efficient invariance learning in the general linear model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Hepburn, Valero Laparra, Ra\'ul Santos-Rodriguez, Jes\'us Malo</p>
<p>Abstract: Previously, Barlow and Attneave hypothesised a link between biological vision and information maximisation. Following Shannon, information was defined using the probability of natural images. Several physiological and psychophysical phenomena have been derived from principles like info-max, efficient coding, or optimal denoising. However, it remains unclear how this link is expressed in mathematical terms from image probability. Classical derivations were subjected to strong assumptions on the probability models and on the behaviour of the sensors. Moreover, the direct evaluation of the hypothesis was limited by the inability of classical image models to deliver accurate estimates of the probability. Here, we directly evaluate image probabilities using a generative model for natural images, and analyse how probability-related factors can be combined to predict the sensitivity of state-of-the-art subjective image quality metrics, a proxy for human perception. We use information theory and regression analysis to find a simple model that when combining just two probability-related factors achieves 0.77 correlation with subjective metrics. This probability-based model is validated in two ways: through direct comparison with the opinion of real observers in a subjective quality experiment, and by reproducing basic trends of classical psychophysical facts such as the Contrast Sensitivity Function, the Weber-law, and contrast masking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ganzhao Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonsmooth composite optimization with orthogonality constraints has a wide range of applications in statistical learning and data science. However, this problem is challenging due to its nonsmooth objective and computationally expensive, non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose a new approach called \textbf{OBCD}, which leverages Block Coordinate Descent to address these challenges. \textbf{OBCD} is a feasible method with a small computational footprint. In each iteration, it updates $k$ rows of the solution matrix, where $k \geq 2$, by globally solving a small nonsmooth optimization problem under orthogonality constraints. We prove that the limiting points of \textbf{OBCD}, referred to as (global) block-$k$ stationary points, offer stronger optimality than standard critical points. Furthermore, we show that \textbf{OBCD} converges to $\epsilon$-block-$k$ stationary points with an ergodic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$. Additionally, under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish the non-ergodic convergence rate of \textbf{OBCD}. We also extend \textbf{OBCD} by incorporating breakpoint searching methods for subproblem solving and greedy strategies for working set selection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach across various tasks.</p>

Murino, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17(2016) 1-72, that involves operator valued positive semidefinite kernels and their reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The results concern general cases when convex or nonconvex loss functions and finite or infinite dimensional input spaces are considered. We show that the general framework allows infinite dimensional input spaces and nonconvex loss functions for some special cases, in particular in case the loss functions are Gateaux differentiable. Detailed calculations are provided for the exponential least squares loss functions that lead to systems of partially nonlinear equations for which a particular different types of Newton's approximation methods based on the interior point method can be used. Some numerical experiments are performed on a toy model that illustrate the tractability of the methods that we propose.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Yu, Zhengyuan Yang, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Kevin Lin, Zicheng Liu, Xinchao Wang, Lijuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose MM-Vet, an evaluation benchmark that examines large multimodal models (LMMs) on complicated multimodal tasks. Recent LMMs have shown various intriguing abilities, such as solving math problems written on the blackboard, reasoning about events and celebrities in news images, and explaining visual jokes. Rapid model advancements pose challenges to evaluation benchmark development. Problems include: (1) How to systematically structure and evaluate the complicated multimodal tasks; (2) How to design evaluation metrics that work well across question and answer types; and (3) How to give model insights beyond a simple performance ranking. To this end, we present MM-Vet, designed based on the insight that the intriguing ability to solve complicated tasks is often achieved by a generalist model being able to integrate different core vision-language (VL) capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core VL capabilities and examines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability combination. For evaluation metrics, we propose an LLM-based evaluator for open-ended outputs. The evaluator enables the evaluation across different question types and answer styles, resulting in a unified scoring metric. We evaluate representative LMMs on MM-Vet, providing insights into the capabilities of different LMM system paradigms and models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Raghuraman, Adam W. Harley, Leonidas Guibas</p>
<p>Abstract: Current machine learning methods struggle to solve Bongard problems, which are a type of IQ test that requires deriving an abstract "concept" from a set of positive and negative "support" images, and then classifying whether or not a new query image depicts the key concept. On Bongard-HOI, a benchmark for natural-image Bongard problems, most existing methods have reached at best 69% accuracy (where chance is 50%). Low accuracy is often attributed to neural nets' lack of ability to find human-like symbolic rules. In this work, we point out that many existing methods are forfeiting accuracy due to a much simpler problem: they do not adapt image features given information contained in the support set as a whole, and rely instead on information extracted from individual supports. This is a critical issue, because the "key concept" in a typical Bongard problem can often only be distinguished using multiple positives and multiple negatives. We explore simple methods to incorporate this context and show substantial gains over prior works, leading to new state-of-the-art accuracy on Bongard-LOGO (75.3%) and Bongard-HOI (76.4%) compared to methods with equivalent vision backbone architectures and strong performance on the original Bongard problem set (60.8%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Katariina Perkonoja, Kari Auranen, Joni Virta</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth in data availability has facilitated research and development, yet not all industries have benefited equally due to legal and privacy constraints. The healthcare sector faces significant challenges in utilizing patient data because of concerns about data security and confidentiality. To address this, various privacy-preserving methods, including synthetic data generation, have been proposed. Synthetic data replicate existing data as closely as possible, acting as a proxy for sensitive information. While patient data are often longitudinal, this aspect remains underrepresented in existing reviews of synthetic data generation in healthcare. This paper maps and describes methods for generating and evaluating synthetic longitudinal patient data in real-life settings through a systematic literature review, conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and incorporating data from five databases up to May 2024. Thirty-nine methods were identified, with four addressing all challenges of longitudinal data generation, though none included privacy-preserving mechanisms. Resemblance was evaluated in most studies, utility in the majority, and privacy in just over half. Only a small fraction of studies assessed all three aspects. Our findings highlight the need for further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhou, Xingchen Wan, Lev Proleev, Diana Mincu, Jilin Chen, Katherine Heller, Subhrajit Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting and in-context learning (ICL) have become efficient learning paradigms for large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs suffer from prompt brittleness and various bias factors in the prompt, including but not limited to the formatting, the choice verbalizers, and the ICL examples. To address this problem that results in unexpected performance degradation, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of these biases while recovering LLM performance. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of the existing calibration methods, where we both provide a unified view and reveal the failure cases. Inspired by these analyses, we propose Batch Calibration (BC), a simple yet intuitive method that controls the contextual bias from the batched input, unifies various prior approaches, and effectively addresses the aforementioned issues. BC is zero-shot, inference-only, and incurs negligible additional costs. In the few-shot setup, we further extend BC to allow it to learn the contextual bias from labeled data. We validate the effectiveness of BC with PaLM 2-(S, M, L) and CLIP models and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over previous calibration baselines across more than 10 natural language understanding and image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Ghafourian, Julian Fierrez, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Ruben Tolosana, Aythami Morales</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm to conduct collaborative learning among clients on a joint model. The primary goal is to share clients' local training parameters with an integrating server while preserving their privacy. This method permits to exploit the potential of massive mobile users' data for the benefit of machine learning models' performance while keeping sensitive data on local devices. On the downside, FL raises security and privacy concerns that have just started to be studied. To address some of the key threats in FL, researchers have proposed to use secure aggregation methods (e.g. homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, etc.). These solutions improve some security and privacy metrics, but at the same time bring about other serious threats such as poisoning attacks, backdoor attacks, and free running attacks. This paper proposes a new defense method against poisoning attacks in FL called SaFL (Sybil-aware Federated Learning) that minimizes the effect of sybils with a novel time-variant aggregation scheme.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pourya Behmandpoor, Marc Moonen, Panagiotis Patrinos</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed learning and adaptation have received significant interest and found wide-ranging applications in machine learning and signal processing. While various approaches, such as shared-memory optimization, multi-task learning, and consensus-based learning (e.g., federated learning and learning over graphs), focus on optimizing either local costs or a global cost, there remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically focuses on a scenario where agents collaborate towards a common task (i.e., optimizing a global cost equal to aggregated local costs) while effectively having distinct individual tasks (i.e., optimizing individual local parameters in a local cost). Each agent's actions can potentially impact other agents' performance through interactions. Notably, each agent has access to only its local zeroth-order oracle (i.e., cost function value) and shares scalar values, rather than gradient vectors, with other agents, leading to communication bandwidth efficiency and agent privacy. Agents employ zeroth-order optimization to update their parameters, and the asynchronous message-passing between them is subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant use-case of deep learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual policies to maximize a global reward, e.g., a sum of data rates.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study addresses critical gaps in automated lymphoma segmentation from PET/CT images, focusing on issues often overlooked in existing literature. While deep learning has been applied for lymphoma lesion segmentation, few studies incorporate out-of-distribution testing, raising concerns about model generalizability across diverse imaging conditions and patient populations. We highlight the need to compare model performance with expert human annotators, including intra- and inter-observer variability, to understand task difficulty better. Most approaches focus on overall segmentation accuracy but overlook lesion-specific metrics important for precise lesion detection and disease quantification.To address these gaps, we propose a clinically-relevant framework for evaluating deep neural networks. Using this lesion-specific evaluation, we assess the performance of four deep segmentation networks (ResUNet, SegResNet, DynUNet, and SwinUNETR) across 611 cases from multi-institutional datasets, covering various lymphoma subtypes and lesion characteristics. Beyond standard metrics like the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), we evaluate clinical lesion measures and their prediction errors. We also introduce detection criteria for lesion localization and propose a new detection Criterion 3 based on metabolic characteristics. We show that networks perform better on large, intense lesions with higher metabolic activity.Finally, we compare network performance to expert human observers via intra- and inter-observer variability analyses, demonstrating that network errors closely resemble those made by experts. Some small, faint lesions remain challenging for both humans and networks. This study aims to improve automated lesion segmentation's clinical relevance, supporting better treatment decisions for lymphoma patients.

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Chrosniak, Jingyun Ning, Madhur Behl</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous racing is a critical research area for autonomous driving, presenting significant challenges in vehicle dynamics modeling, such as balancing model precision and computational efficiency at high speeds (>280km/h), where minor errors in modeling have severe consequences. Existing physics-based models for vehicle dynamics require elaborate testing setups and tuning, which are hard to implement, time-intensive, and cost-prohibitive. Conversely, purely data-driven approaches do not generalize well and cannot adequately ensure physical constraints on predictions. This paper introduces Deep Dynamics, a physics-constrained neural network (PCNN) for vehicle dynamics modeling of an autonomous racecar. It combines physics coefficient estimation and dynamical equations to accurately predict vehicle states at high speeds and includes a unique Physics Guard layer to ensure internal coefficient estimates remain within their nominal physical ranges. Open-loop and closed-loop performance assessments, using a physics-based simulator and full-scale autonomous Indy racecar data, highlight Deep Dynamics as a promising approach for modeling racecar vehicle dynamics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Decentralised learning has recently gained traction as an alternative to federated learning in which both data and coordination are distributed. To preserve the confidentiality of users' data, decentralised learning relies on differential privacy, multi-party computation, or both. However, running multiple privacy-preserving summations in sequence may allow adversaries to perform reconstruction attacks. Current reconstruction countermeasures either cannot trivially be adapted to the distributed setting, or add excessive amounts of noise.
  In this work, we first show that passive honest-but-curious adversaries can infer other users' private data after several privacy-preserving summations. For example, in subgraphs with 18 users, we show that only three passive honest-but-curious adversaries succeed at reconstructing private data 11.0% of the time, requiring an average of 8.8 summations per adversary. The success rate depends only on the adversaries' direct neighbourhood, and is independent of the size of the full network. We consider weak adversaries that do not control the graph topology, cannot exploit the summation's inner workings, and do not have auxiliary knowledge; and show that these adversaries can still infer private data.
  We analyse how reconstruction relates to topology and propose the first topology-based decentralised defence against reconstruction attacks. We show that reconstruction requires a number of adversaries linear in the length of the network's shortest cycle. Consequently, exact attacks over privacy-preserving summations are impossible in acyclic networks.
  Our work is a stepping stone for a formal theory of topology-based decentralised reconstruction defences. Such a theory would generalise our countermeasure beyond summation, define confidentiality in terms of entropy, and describe the interactions with (topology-aware) differential privacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shraddha M. Naik, Tanujit Chakraborty, Madhurima Panja, Abdenour Hadid, Bibhas Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit imbalanced data distribution, where certain class levels are severely underrepresented. In such cases, traditional pattern classifiers have shown a bias towards the majority class, impeding accurate predictions for the minority class. This paper introduces an imbalanced data-oriented classifier using probabilistic neural networks (PNN) with a skew-normal kernel function to address this major challenge. PNN is known for providing probabilistic outputs, enabling quantification of prediction confidence, interpretability, and the ability to handle limited data. By leveraging the skew-normal distribution, which offers increased flexibility, particularly for imbalanced and non-symmetric data, our proposed Skew-Probabilistic Neural Networks (SkewPNN) can better represent underlying class densities. Hyperparameter fine-tuning is imperative to optimize the performance of the proposed approach on imbalanced datasets. To this end, we employ a population-based heuristic algorithm, the Bat optimization algorithm, to explore the hyperparameter space effectively. We also prove the statistical consistency of the density estimates, suggesting that the true distribution will be approached smoothly as the sample size increases. Theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed SkewPNN and BA-SkewPNN is also provided. Numerical simulations have been conducted on different synthetic datasets, comparing various benchmark-imbalanced learners. Real-data analysis on several datasets shows that SkewPNN and BA-SkewPNN substantially outperform most state-of-the-art machine-learning methods for both balanced and imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class categories) in most experimental settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrian de Wynter, Xun Wang, Qilong Gu, Si-Qing Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern generative language models are capable of interpreting input strings as instructions, or prompts, and carry out tasks based on them. Many approaches to prompting and pre-training these models involve the automated generation of these prompts: meta-prompting, or prompting to obtain prompts. We propose a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and describe them. This framework is flexible enough to account for stochasticity, and allows us to obtain formal results around task agnosticity and equivalence of various meta-prompting approaches. Experimentally, we test our framework in two active areas of model research: creativity and ideation. We find that user preference strongly favors (p < 0.01) the prompts generated under meta-prompting, as well as their corresponding outputs, over a series of hardcoded baseline prompts that include the original task definition. Using our framework, we argue that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting at generating desirable outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Kelshaw, Luca Magri</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) to solve two types of inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs), which are nonlinear and vary both in space and time. In the first inverse problem, we are given data that is offset by spatially varying systematic error (i.e., the bias, also known as the epistemic uncertainty). The task is to uncover the true state, which is the solution of the PDE, from the biased data. In the second inverse problem, we are given sparse information on the solution of a PDE. The task is to reconstruct the solution in space with high-resolution. First, we present the PC-CNN, which constrains the PDE with a time-windowing scheme to handle sequential data. Second, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for uncovering solutions from biased data. We analyse both linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows. We find that the PC-CNN correctly recovers the true solution for a variety of biases, which are parameterised as non-convex functions. Third, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for reconstructing solutions from sparse information for the turbulent flow. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal chaotic solution on a high-resolution grid from only 1% of the information contained in it. For both tasks, we further analyse the Navier-Stokes solutions. We find that the inferred solutions have a physical spectral energy content, whereas traditional methods, such as interpolation, do not. This work opens opportunities for solving inverse problems with partial differential equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joohwan Ko, Kyurae Kim, Woo Chang Kim, Jacob R. Gardner</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational families with full-rank covariance approximations are known not to work well in black-box variational inference (BBVI), both empirically and theoretically. In fact, recent computational complexity results for BBVI have established that full-rank variational families scale poorly with the dimensionality of the problem compared to e.g. mean-field families. This is particularly critical to hierarchical Bayesian models with local variables; their dimensionality increases with the size of the datasets. Consequently, one gets an iteration complexity with an explicit $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ dependence on the dataset size $N$. In this paper, we explore a theoretical middle ground between mean-field variational families and full-rank families: structured variational families. We rigorously prove that certain scale matrix structures can achieve a better iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)$, implying better scaling with respect to $N$. We empirically verify our theoretical results on large-scale hierarchical models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14973">Discovering group dynamics in coordinated time series via hierarchical recurrent switching-state models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael T. Wojnowicz, Kaitlin Gili, Preetish Rath, Eric Miller, Jeffrey Miller, Clifford Hancock, Meghan O'Donovan, Seth Elkin-Frankston, Tad T. Bruny\'e, Michael C. Hughes</p>
<p>Abstract: We seek a computationally efficient model for a collection of time series arising from multiple interacting entities (a.k.a. "agents"). Recent models of spatiotemporal patterns across individuals fail to incorporate explicit system-level collective behavior that can influence the trajectories of individual entities. To address this gap in the literature, we present a new hierarchical switching-state model that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to simultaneously learn both system-level and individual-level dynamics. We employ a latent system-level discrete state Markov chain that provides top-down influence on latent entity-level chains which in turn govern the emission of each observed time series. Recurrent feedback from the observations to the latent chains at both entity and system levels allows recent situational context to inform how dynamics unfold at all levels in bottom-up fashion. We hypothesize that including both top-down and bottom-up influences on group dynamics will improve interpretability of the learned dynamics and reduce error when forecasting. Our hierarchical switching recurrent dynamical model can be learned via closed-form variational coordinate ascent updates to all latent chains that scale linearly in the number of entities. This is asymptotically no more costly than fitting a separate model for each entity. Analysis of both synthetic data and real basketball team movements suggests our lean parametric model can achieve competitive forecasts compared to larger neural network models that require far more computational resources. Further experiments on soldier data as well as a synthetic task with 64 cooperating entities show how our approach can yield interpretable insights about team dynamics over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangke Chen, Yedi Zhang, Fu Song, Ting Wang, Xiaoning Du, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) automates song covers by converting a source singing voice from a source singer into a new singing voice with the same lyrics and melody as the source, but sounds like being covered by the target singer of some given target singing voices. However, it raises serious concerns about copyright and civil right infringements. We propose SongBsAb, the first proactive approach to tackle SVC-based illegal song covers. SongBsAb adds perturbations to singing voices before releasing them, so that when they are used, the process of SVC will be interfered, leading to unexpected singing voices. Perturbations are carefully crafted to (1) provide a dual prevention, i.e., preventing the singing voice from being used as the source and target singing voice in SVC, by proposing a gender-transformation loss and a high/low hierarchy multi-target loss, respectively; and (2) be harmless, i.e., no side-effect on the enjoyment of protected songs, by refining a psychoacoustic model-based loss with the backing track as an additional masker, a unique accompanying element for singing voices compared to ordinary speech voices. We also adopt a frame-level interaction reduction-based loss and encoder ensemble to enhance the transferability of SongBsAb to unknown SVC models. We demonstrate the prevention effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness of SongBsAb on five diverse and promising SVC models, using both English and Chinese datasets, and both objective and human study-based subjective metrics. Our work fosters an emerging research direction for mitigating illegal automated song covers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanchang Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their task performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lirui Wang, Jialiang Zhao, Yilun Du, Edward H. Adelson, Russ Tedrake</p>
<p>Abstract: Training general robotic policies from heterogeneous data for different tasks is a significant challenge. Existing robotic datasets vary in different modalities such as color, depth, tactile, and proprioceptive information, and collected in different domains such as simulation, real robots, and human videos. Current methods usually collect and pool all data from one domain to train a single policy to handle such heterogeneity in tasks and domains, which is prohibitively expensive and difficult. In this work, we present a flexible approach, dubbed Policy Composition, to combine information across such diverse modalities and domains for learning scene-level and task-level generalized manipulation skills, by composing different data distributions represented with diffusion models. Our method can use task-level composition for multi-task manipulation and be composed with analytic cost functions to adapt policy behaviors at inference time. We train our method on simulation, human, and real robot data and evaluate in tool-use tasks. The composed policy achieves robust and dexterous performance under varying scenes and tasks and outperforms baselines from a single data source in both simulation and real-world experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Paulin, Peter A. Whalley</p>
<p>Abstract: A method for analyzing non-asymptotic guarantees of numerical discretizations of ergodic SDEs in Wasserstein-2 distance is presented by Sanz-Serna and Zygalakis in ``Wasserstein distance estimates for the distributions of numerical approximations to ergodic stochastic differential equations". They analyze the UBU integrator which is strong order two and only requires one gradient evaluation per step, resulting in desirable non-asymptotic guarantees, in particular $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-1/2})$ steps to reach a distance of $\epsilon > 0$ in Wasserstein-2 distance away from the target distribution. However, there is a mistake in the local error estimates in Sanz-Serna and Zygalakis (2021), in particular, a stronger assumption is needed to achieve these complexity estimates. This note reconciles the theory with the dimension dependence observed in practice in many applications of interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aleksei Zakharchenko, Sharon Farber, Itzik Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Inertial sensors are widely used in a variety of applications. A common task is orientation estimation. To tackle such a task, attitude and heading reference system algorithms are applied. Relying on the gyroscope readings, the accelerometer measurements are used to update the attitude angles, and magnetometer measurements are utilized to update the heading angle. In indoor environments, magnetometers suffer from interference that degrades their performance resulting in poor heading angle estimation. Therefore, applications that estimate the heading angle of moving objects, such as walking pedestrians, closets, and refrigerators, are prone to error. To circumvent such situations, we propose DoorINet, an end-to-end deep-learning framework to calculate the heading angle from door-mounted, low-cost inertial sensors without using magnetometers. To evaluate our approach, we record a unique dataset containing 391 minutes of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements and corresponding ground-truth heading angle. We show that our proposed approach outperforms commonly used, model based approaches and data-driven methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranshav Gajjar, Azuka Chiejina, Vijay K. Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising solution to improve spectrum access techniques by utilizing data-driven approaches to manage and share limited spectrum resources for emerging applications. For several of these applications, the sensitive wireless data (such as spectrograms) are stored in a shared database or multistakeholder cloud environment and are therefore prone to privacy leaks. This paper aims to address such privacy concerns by examining the representative case study of shared database scenarios in 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) networks where we have a shared database within the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller. We focus on securing the data that can be used by machine learning (ML) models for spectrum sharing and interference mitigation applications without compromising the model and network performances. The underlying idea is to leverage a (i) Shuffling-based learnable encryption technique to encrypt the data, following which, (ii) employ a custom Vision transformer (ViT) as the trained ML model that is capable of performing accurate inferences on such encrypted data. The paper offers a thorough analysis and comparisons with analogous convolutional neural networks (CNN) as well as deeper architectures (such as ResNet-50) as baselines. Our experiments showcase that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN with an improvement of 24.5% and 23.9% for the percent accuracy and F1-Score respectively when operated on encrypted data. Though deeper ResNet-50 architecture is obtained as a slightly more accurate model, with an increase of 4.4%, the proposed approach boasts a reduction of parameters by 99.32%, and thus, offers a much-improved prediction time by nearly 60%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi-Lin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This report studies the fitting of Hessian or its inverse for stochastic optimizations using a Hessian fitting criterion from the preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) method, which is intimately related to many commonly used second-order and adaptive gradient optimizers, e.g., BFGS, Gaussian-Newton algorithm, natural gradient descent, AdaGrad, etc. Our analyses reveal the efficiency and reliability differences among a wide range of preconditioner fitting methods, from closed-form to iterative solutions, using Hessian-vector products or stochastic gradients only, with Hessian fittings in the Euclidean space, the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPL) matrices, to a variety of Lie groups. The most intriguing discovery is that the Hessian fitting itself as an optimization problem is strongly convex under mild conditions in certain general Lie groups. This discovery turns Hessian fitting into a well-behaved Lie group optimization problem and facilitates the designs of highly efficient and elegant Lie group sparse preconditioner fitting methods for large-scale stochastic optimizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianming Li, Zongxi Li, Jing Li, Haoran Xie, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Common approaches rely on fixed-length embedding vectors from language models as sentence embeddings for downstream tasks such as semantic textual similarity (STS). Such methods are limited in their flexibility due to unknown computational constraints and budgets across various applications. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) \cite{aditya2022matryoshka} encodes information at finer granularities, i.e., with lower embedding dimensions, to adaptively accommodate \emph{ad hoc} tasks. Similar accuracy can be achieved with a smaller embedding size, leading to speedups in downstream tasks. Despite its improved efficiency, MRL still requires traversing all Transformer layers before obtaining the embedding, which remains the dominant factor in time and memory consumption. This prompts consideration of whether the fixed number of Transformer layers affects representation quality and whether using intermediate layers for sentence representation is feasible. In this paper, we introduce a novel sentence embedding model called \textit{Two-dimensional Matryoshka Sentence Embedding} (2DMSE)\footnote{Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/SeanLee97/AnglE/blob/main/README_2DMSE.md}.}. It supports elastic settings for both embedding sizes and Transformer layers, offering greater flexibility and efficiency than MRL. We conduct extensive experiments on STS tasks and downstream applications. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in dynamically supporting different embedding sizes and Transformer layers, allowing it to be highly adaptable to various scenarios.</p>

Our model leverages quantum computing principles to enhance the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. QMSAN uses a quantum attention mechanism based on mixed state, allowing for direct similarity estimation between queries and keys in the quantum domain. This approach leads to more effective attention coefficient calculations. We also propose an innovative quantum positional encoding scheme, implemented through fixed quantum gates within the circuit, improving the model's ability to capture sequence information without additional qubit resources. In numerical experiments of text classification tasks on public datasets, QMSAN outperforms Quantum Self-Attention Neural Network (QSANN). Furthermore, we demonstrate QMSAN's robustness in different quantum noise environments, highlighting its potential for near-term quantum devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Feng Ruan, Huiyuan Wang, Qi Long, Weijie J. Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Since ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, embedding (nearly) unnoticeable statistical signals into text generated by large language models (LLMs), also known as watermarking, has been used as a principled approach to provable detection of LLM-generated text from its human-written counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments.</p>

This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems. This framework facilitates the broader adoption of secure, quantum-enhanced financial services and inspires future innovations that could use QML to tackle complex challenges in other areas requiring high confidentiality and accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao Ren, Botian Xu, Xue Yang, Yifan Pu, Jingyi Wang, Zhidong Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: In most modern object detection pipelines, the detection proposals are processed independently given the feature map. Therefore, they overlook the underlying relationships between objects and the surrounding background, which could have provided additional context for accurate detection. Because aerial imagery is almost orthographic, the spatial relations in image space closely align with those in the physical world, and inter-object and object-background relationships become particularly significant. To address this oversight, we propose a framework that leverages the strengths of Transformer-based models and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) features to capture such relationships. Specifically, Building on two-stage detectors, we treat Region of Interest (RoI) proposals as tokens, accompanied by CLIP Tokens obtained from multi-level image segments. These tokens are then passed through a Transformer encoder, where specific spatial and geometric relations are incorporated into the attention weights, which are adaptively modulated and regularized. Additionally, we introduce self-supervised constraints on CLIP Tokens to ensure consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent improvements, setting new state-of-the-art results with increases of 1.37 mAP$_{50}$ on DOTA-v1.0, 5.30 mAP$_{50}$ on DOTA-v1.5, 2.30 mAP$_{50}$ on DOTA-v2.0 and 3.23 mAP$_{50}$ on DIOR-R.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Yang, David Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deriving formal bounds on the expressivity of transformers, as well as studying transformers that are constructed to implement known algorithms, are both effective methods for better understanding the computational power of transformers. Towards both ends, we introduce the temporal counting logic $\textsf{K}_\text{t}$[#] alongside the RASP variant $\textsf{C-RASP}$. We show they are equivalent to each other, and that together they are the best-known lower bound on the formal expressivity of future-masked soft attention transformers with unbounded input size. We prove this by showing all $\textsf{K}_\text{t}$[#] formulas can be compiled into these transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Jingyuan Huang, Qingcheng Zeng, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Haiyan Zhao, Kai Mei, Yanda Meng, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of "Concept Depth" to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngbin Lee, Yejin Kim, Javier Sanz-Cruzado, Richard McCreadie, Yongjae Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems can be helpful for individuals to make well-informed decisions in complex financial markets. While many studies have focused on predicting stock prices, even advanced models fall short of accurately forecasting them. Additionally, previous studies indicate that individual investors often disregard established investment theories, favoring their personal preferences instead. This presents a challenge for stock recommendation systems, which must not only provide strong investment performance but also respect these individual preferences. To create effective stock recommender systems, three critical elements must be incorporated: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) the temporal dynamics of the first two. In response, we propose a new model, Portfolio Temporal Graph Network Recommender PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing sampling. On real-world individual trading data, our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models. Indeed, we show that PfoTGNRec is an effective solution that can balance customer preferences with the need to suggest portfolios with high Return-on-Investment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sourajit Saha, Tejas Gokhale</p>
<p>Abstract: Downsampling operators break the shift invariance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and this affects the robustness of features learned by CNNs when dealing with even small pixel-level shift. Through a large-scale correlation analysis framework, we study shift invariance of CNNs by inspecting existing downsampling operators in terms of their maximum-sampling bias (MSB), and find that MSB is negatively correlated with shift invariance. Based on this crucial insight, we propose a learnable pooling operator called Translation Invariant Polyphase Sampling (TIPS) and two regularizations on the intermediate feature maps of TIPS to reduce MSB and learn translation-invariant representations. TIPS can be integrated into any CNN and can be trained end-to-end with marginal computational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that TIPS results in consistent performance gains in terms of accuracy, shift consistency, and shift fidelity on multiple benchmarks for image classification and semantic segmentation compared to previous methods and also leads to improvements in adversarial and distributional robustness. TIPS results in the lowest MSB compared to all previous methods, thus explaining our strong empirical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Sun, Yu Yao, Huangyuan Hao, Yumou Qiu, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jason Blocklove, Siddharth Garg, Ramesh Karri, Hammond Pearce</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities for producing code in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). However, most of the focus remains on their abilities to write functional code, not test code. The hardware design process consists of both design and test, and so eschewing validation and verification leaves considerable potential benefit unexplored, given that a design and test framework may allow for progress towards full automation of the digital design pipeline. In this work, we perform one of the first studies exploring how a LLM can both design and test hardware modules from provided specifications. Using a suite of 8 representative benchmarks, we examined the capabilities and limitations of the state-of-the-art conversational LLMs when producing Verilog for functional and verification purposes. We taped out the benchmarks on a Skywater 130nm shuttle and received the functional chip.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Reza Rezaei, Adji Bousso Dieng</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and often outperform strong baselines such as Mambas, neural ODEs, and diffusion models in the domains we studied.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative diffusion models apply the concept of Langevin dynamics in physics to machine leaning, attracting a lot of interests from engineering, statistics and physics, but a complete picture about inherent mechanisms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a transparent physics analysis of diffusion models, formulating the fluctuation theorem, entropy production, equilibrium measure, and Franz-Parisi potential to understand the dynamic process and intrinsic phase transitions. Our analysis is rooted in a path integral representation of both forward and backward dynamics, and in treating the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder akin to that in spin glass theory. Our study thus links stochastic thermodynamics, statistical inference and geometry based analysis together to yield a coherent picture about how the generative diffusion models work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Wycoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Regression trees have emerged as a preeminent tool for solving real-world regression problems due to their ability to deal with nonlinearities, interaction effects and sharp discontinuities. In this article, we rather study regression trees applied to well-behaved, differentiable functions, and determine the relationship between node parameters and the local gradient of the function being approximated. We find a simple estimate of the gradient which can be efficiently computed using quantities exposed by popular tree learning libraries. This allows the tools developed in the context of differentiable algorithms, like neural nets and Gaussian processes, to be deployed to tree-based models. To demonstrate this, we study measures of model sensitivity defined in terms of integrals of gradients and demonstrate how to compute them for regression trees using the proposed gradient estimates. Quantitative and qualitative numerical experiments reveal the capability of gradients estimated by regression trees to improve predictive analysis, solve tasks in uncertainty quantification, and provide interpretation of model behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingqing Wang, Zhiwei Nie, Yonghong He, Athanasios V. Vasilakos, Zhixiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein function prediction is currently achieved by encoding its sequence or structure, where the sequence-to-function transcendence and high-quality structural data scarcity lead to obvious performance bottlenecks. Protein domains are "building blocks" of proteins that are functionally independent, and their combinations determine the diverse biological functions. However, most existing studies have yet to thoroughly explore the intricate functional information contained in the protein domains. To fill this gap, we propose a synergistic integration approach for a function-aware domain representation, and a domain-joint contrastive learning strategy to distinguish different protein functions while aligning the modalities. Specifically, we align the domain semantics with GO terms and text description to pre-train domain embeddings. Furthermore, we partition proteins into multiple sub-views based on continuous joint domains for contrastive training under the supervision of a novel triplet InfoNCE loss. Our approach significantly and comprehensively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks, and clearly differentiates proteins carrying distinct functions compared to the competitor.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubhang Bhatnagar, Narendra Ahuja</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model, inspired by electrostatic fields in physics that, instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Zong, Hang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of stock movements is crucial for investment strategies. Stock prices are subject to the influence of various forms of information, including financial indicators, sentiment analysis, news documents, and relational structures. Predominant analytical approaches, however, tend to address only unimodal or bimodal sources, neglecting the complexity of multimodal data. Further complicating the landscape are the issues of data sparsity and semantic conflicts between these modalities, which are frequently overlooked by current models, leading to unstable performance and limiting practical applicability. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel architecture, named Multimodal Stable Fusion with Gated Cross-Attention (MSGCA), designed to robustly integrate multimodal input for stock movement prediction. The MSGCA framework consists of three integral components: (1) a trimodal encoding module, responsible for processing indicator sequences, dynamic documents, and a relational graph, and standardizing their feature representations; (2) a cross-feature fusion module, where primary and consistent features guide the multimodal fusion of the three modalities via a pair of gated cross-attention networks; and (3) a prediction module, which refines the fused features through temporal and dimensional reduction to execute precise movement forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the MSGCA framework exceeds current leading methods, achieving performance gains of 8.1%, 6.1%, 21.7% and 31.6% on four multimodal datasets, respectively, attributed to its enhanced multimodal fusion stability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Libo Zhang, Yue Ning</p>
<p>Abstract: Salient facts of sociopolitical events are distilled into quadruples following a format of subject, relation, object, and timestamp. Machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been built to make predictions and infer relations on the quadruple-based knowledge graphs (KGs). In many applications, quadruples are extended to quintuples with auxiliary attributes such as text summaries that describe the quadruple events. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate how large language models (LLMs) streamline the design of event prediction frameworks using quadruple-based or quintuple-based data while maintaining competitive accuracy. We propose LEAP, a unified framework that leverages large language models as event predictors. Specifically, we develop multiple prompt templates to frame the object prediction (OP) task as a standard question-answering (QA) task, suitable for instruction fine-tuning with an encoder-decoder LLM. For multi-event forecasting (MEF) task, we design a simple yet effective prompt template for each event quintuple. This novel approach removes the need for GNNs and RNNs, instead utilizing an encoder-only LLM to generate fixed intermediate embeddings, which are processed by a customized downstream head with a self-attention mechanism to predict potential relation occurrences in the future. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using various evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

In this work, we propose Imagination Policy, a novel multi-task key-frame policy network for solving high-precision pick and place tasks. Instead of learning actions directly, Imagination Policy generates point clouds to imagine desired states which are then translated to actions using rigid action estimation. This transforms action inference into a local generative task. We leverage pick and place symmetries underlying the tasks in the generation process and achieve extremely high sample efficiency and generalizability to unseen configurations. Finally, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various tasks on the RLbench benchmark compared with several strong baselines and validate our approach on a real robot.</p>

<p>Abstract: A plethora of sentence embedding models makes it challenging to choose one, especially for technical domains rich with specialized vocabulary. In this work, we domain adapt embeddings using telecom, health and science datasets for question answering. We evaluate embeddings obtained from publicly available models and their domain-adapted variants, on both point retrieval accuracies, as well as their (95\%) confidence intervals. We establish a systematic method to obtain thresholds for similarity scores for different embeddings. As expected, we observe that fine-tuning improves mean bootstrapped accuracies. We also observe that it results in tighter confidence intervals, which further improve when pre-training is preceded by fine-tuning. We introduce metrics which measure the distributional overlaps of top-$K$, correct and random document similarities with the question. Further, we show that these metrics are correlated with retrieval accuracy and similarity thresholds. Recent literature shows conflicting effects of isotropy on retrieval accuracies. Our experiments establish that the isotropy of embeddings (as measured by two independent state-of-the-art isotropy metric definitions) is poorly correlated with retrieval performance. We show that embeddings for domain-specific sentences have little overlap with those for domain-agnostic ones, and fine-tuning moves them further apart. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for use of our methodology and metrics by researchers and practitioners.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present BricksRL, a platform designed to democratize access to robotics for reinforcement learning research and education. BricksRL facilitates the creation, design, and training of custom LEGO robots in the real world by interfacing them with the TorchRL library for reinforcement learning agents. The integration of TorchRL with the LEGO hubs, via Bluetooth bidirectional communication, enables state-of-the-art reinforcement learning training on GPUs for a wide variety of LEGO builds. This offers a flexible and cost-efficient approach for scaling and also provides a robust infrastructure for robot-environment-algorithm communication. We present various experiments across tasks and robot configurations, providing built plans and training results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inexpensive LEGO robots can be trained end-to-end in the real world to achieve simple tasks, with training times typically under 120 minutes on a normal laptop. Moreover, we show how users can extend the capabilities, exemplified by the successful integration of non-LEGO sensors. By enhancing accessibility to both robotics and reinforcement learning, BricksRL establishes a strong foundation for democratized robotic learning in research and educational settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: A/B testers that conduct large-scale tests often prioritize lifts as the main outcome metric and want to be able to control costs resulting from false rejections of the null. This work develops a decision-theoretic framework for maximizing profits subject to false discovery rate (FDR) control. We build an empirical Bayes solution for the problem via a greedy knapsack approach. We derive an oracle rule based on ranking the ratio of expected lifts and the cost of wrong rejections using the local false discovery rate (lfdr) statistic. Our oracle decision rule is valid and optimal for large-scale tests. Further, we establish asymptotic validity for the data-driven procedure and demonstrate finite-sample validity in experimental studies. We also demonstrate the merit of the proposed method over other FDR control methods. Finally, we discuss an application to data collected by experiments on the Optimizely platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ya Gao, Hans Moen, Saila Koivusalo, Miika Koskinen, Pekka Marttinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Nursing notes, an important part of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), track a patient's health during a care episode. Summarizing key information in nursing notes can help clinicians quickly understand patients' conditions. However, existing summarization methods in the clinical setting, especially abstractive methods, have overlooked nursing notes and require reference summaries for training. We introduce QGSumm, a novel query-guided self-supervised domain adaptation approach for abstractive nursing note summarization. The method uses patient-related clinical queries for guidance, and hence does not need reference summaries for training. Through automatic experiments and manual evaluation by an expert clinician, we study our approach and other state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for nursing note summarization. Our experiments show: 1) GPT-4 is competitive in maintaining information in the original nursing notes, 2) QGSumm can generate high-quality summaries with a good balance between recall of the original content and hallucination rate lower than other top methods. Ultimately, our work offers a new perspective on conditional text summarization, tailored to clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaivardhan Kapoor, Auguste Schulz, Julius Vetter, Felix Pei, Richard Gao, Jakob H. Macke</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern datasets in neuroscience enable unprecedented inquiries into the relationship between complex behaviors and the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons. While latent variable models can successfully extract low-dimensional embeddings from such recordings, using them to generate realistic spiking data, especially in a behavior-dependent manner, still poses a challenge. Here, we present Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking data (LDNS), a diffusion-based generative model with a low-dimensional latent space: LDNS employs an autoencoder with structured state-space (S4) layers to project discrete high-dimensional spiking data into continuous time-aligned latents. On these inferred latents, we train expressive (conditional) diffusion models, enabling us to sample neural activity with realistic single-neuron and population spiking statistics. We validate LDNS on synthetic data, accurately recovering latent structure, firing rates, and spiking statistics. Next, we demonstrate its flexibility by generating variable-length data that mimics human cortical activity during attempted speech. We show how to equip LDNS with an expressive observation model that accounts for single-neuron dynamics not mediated by the latent state, further increasing the realism of generated samples. Finally, conditional LDNS trained on motor cortical activity during diverse reaching behaviors can generate realistic spiking data given reach direction or unseen reach trajectories. In summary, LDNS simultaneously enables inference of low-dimensional latents and realistic conditional generation of neural spiking datasets, opening up further possibilities for simulating experimentally testable hypotheses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many recently published Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems produce audio close to real speech. However, TTS evaluation needs to be revisited to make sense of the results obtained with the new architectures, approaches and datasets. We propose evaluating the quality of synthetic speech as a combination of multiple factors such as prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility. Our approach assesses how well synthetic speech mirrors real speech by obtaining correlates of each factor and measuring their distance from both real speech datasets and noise datasets. We benchmark 35 TTS systems developed between 2008 and 2024 and show that our score computed as an unweighted average of factors strongly correlates with the human evaluations from each time period.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mina Remeli, Moritz Hardt, Robert C. Williamson</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the predictability of online speech on social media, and whether predictability improves with information outside a user's own posts. Recent theoretical results suggest that posts from a user's social circle are as predictive of the user's future posts as that of the user's past posts. Motivated by the success of large language models, we empirically test this hypothesis. We define predictability as a measure of the model's uncertainty, i.e., its negative log-likelihood on future tokens given context. As the basis of our study, we collect 10M tweets for ``tweet-tuning'' base models and a further 6.25M posts from more than five thousand X (previously Twitter) users and their peers. Across four large language models ranging in size from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters, we find that predicting a user's posts from their peers' posts performs poorly. Moreover, the value of the user's own posts for prediction is consistently higher than that of their peers'. We extend our investigation with a detailed analysis on what's learned in-context and the robustness of our findings. From context, base models learn to correctly predict @-mentions and hashtags. Moreover, our results replicate if instead of prompting the model with additional context, we finetune on it. Across the board, we find that predicting the posts of individual users remains hard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Hayase, Alisa Liu, Yejin Choi, Sewoong Oh, Noah A. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: The pretraining data of today's strongest language models is opaque; in particular, little is known about the proportions of various domains or languages represented. In this work, we tackle a task which we call data mixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of training data. We introduce a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source of information: byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majority of modern language models. Our key insight is that the ordered list of merge rules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the token frequencies in its training data. Given a tokenizer's merge list along with example data for each category of interest, we formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. In controlled experiments, we show that our attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizers trained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and data sources. We then apply our approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released with recent LMs. We confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models, and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o and Mistral NeMo's tokenizers are much more multilingual than their predecessors, training on 39% and 47% non-English language data, respectively; Llama 3 extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's and Claude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%). We hope our work sheds light on current design practices for pretraining data, and inspires continued research into data mixture inference for LMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The vast majority of materials science knowledge exists in unstructured natural language, yet structured data is crucial for innovative and systematic materials design. Traditionally, the field has relied on manual curation and partial automation for data extraction for specific use cases. The advent of large language models (LLMs) represents a significant shift, potentially enabling efficient extraction of structured, actionable data from unstructured text by non-experts. While applying LLMs to materials science data extraction presents unique challenges, domain knowledge offers opportunities to guide and validate LLM outputs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-based structured data extraction in materials science, synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions. We address the lack of standardized guidelines and present frameworks for leveraging the synergy between LLMs and materials science expertise. This work serves as a foundational resource for researchers aiming to harness LLMs for data-driven materials research. The insights presented here could significantly enhance how researchers across disciplines access and utilize scientific information, potentially accelerating the development of novel materials for critical societal needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyu Zhang, Zhengran Ji, Boyuan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research in real-time decision-making scenarios and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Catherine Drysdale, Matthew J. Colbrook</p>
<p>Abstract: The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is a major neuroendocrine system, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases. This system also presents interesting mathematical challenges for modeling. We consider a nonlinear delay differential equation model and calculate pseudospectra of three different linearizations: a time-dependent Jacobian, linearization around the limit cycle, and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of Koopman operators (global linearization). The time-dependent Jacobian provided insight into experimental phenomena, explaining why rats respond differently to perturbations during corticosterone secretion's upward versus downward slopes. We developed new mathematical techniques for the other two linearizations to calculate pseudospectra on Banach spaces and apply DMD to delay differential equations, respectively. These methods helped establish local and global limit cycle stability and study transients. Additionally, we discuss using pseudospectra to substantiate the model in experimental contexts and establish bio-variability via data-driven methods. This work is the first to utilize pseudospectra to explore the HPA axis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlo Alberto Barbano, Matteo Brunello, Benoit Dufumier, Marco Grangetto</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to more robust and generalizable representations.

<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijin Dong, Hongzhi Liu, Boyuan Ren, Weimin Xiong, Zhonghai Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains. Most of the existing methods assume the normal sample data clusters around a single central prototype while the real data may consist of multiple categories or subgroups. In addition, existing methods always assume all unlabeled samples are normal while some of them are inevitably being anomalies. To address these issues, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that can efficiently work with limited labeled anomalies. Specifically, we assume the normal sample data may consist of multiple subgroups, and propose to learn multi-normal prototypes to represent them with deep embedding clustering and contrastive learning. Additionally, we propose a method to estimate the likelihood of each unlabeled sample being normal during model training, which can help to learn more efficient data encoder and normal prototypes for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

We propose implementing this algorithm as a series of dense and sparse matrix and vector operations, thereby making it highly parallelizable for a graphical processing unit, at a cost of higher memory usage. Our experiments show that our implementation performs up to about 401.2 times faster than OpenSpiel's Python implementation and, on an expanded set of games, up to about 203.6 times faster than OpenSpiel's C++ implementation and the speedup becomes more pronounced as the size of the game being solved grows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeheng Wang, Timothy van der Laan, Muhammad Usman</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates efficient data compression techniques to handle the vast amounts of data generated by these devices. Chemiresistive sensor arrays (CSAs), a simple-to-fabricate but crucial component in IoT systems, generate large volumes of data due to their simultaneous multi-sensor operations. Classical principal component analysis (cPCA) methods, a common solution to the data compression challenge, face limitations in preserving critical information during dimensionality reduction. In this study, we present self-adaptive quantum kernel (SAQK) PCA as a superior alternative to enhance information retention. Our findings demonstrate that SAQK PCA outperforms cPCA in various back-end machine-learning tasks, especially in low-dimensional scenarios where access to quantum bits is limited. These results highlight the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers to revolutionize data processing in real-world IoT applications by improving the efficiency and reliability of CSA data compression and readout, despite the current constraints on qubit availability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Khazaee, Abdolreza Mohammadi, Ruairi O'Reilly</p>
<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. Our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Machine learning was employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from brain network at different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianyi Zhang, Hao Frank Yang, Ang Li, Xin Guo, Pu Wang, Haiming Wang, Yiran Chen, Hai Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Previous studies on federated learning (FL) often encounter performance degradation due to data heterogeneity among different clients. In light of the recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4v and LLaVA, which demonstrate their exceptional proficiency in multimodal tasks, such as image captioning and multimodal question answering. We introduce a novel federated learning framework, named Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning (MLLM-LLaVA-FL), which employs powerful MLLMs at the server end to address the heterogeneous and long-tailed challenges. Owing to the advanced cross-modality representation capabilities and the extensive open-vocabulary prior knowledge of MLLMs, our framework is adept at harnessing the extensive, yet previously underexploited, open-source data accessible from websites and powerful server-side computational resources. Hence, the MLLM-LLaVA-FL not only enhances the performance but also avoids increasing the risk of privacy leakage and the computational burden on local devices, distinguishing it from prior methodologies. Our framework has three key stages. Initially, we conduct global visual-text pretraining of the model. This pretraining is facilitated by utilizing the extensive open-source data available online, with the assistance of MLLMs. Subsequently, the pretrained model is distributed among various clients for local training. Finally, once the locally trained models are transmitted back to the server, a global alignment is carried out under the supervision of MLLMs to further enhance the performance. Experimental evaluations on established benchmarks, show that our framework delivers promising performance in the typical scenarios with data heterogeneity and long-tail distribution across different clients in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianli Wang, Tatiana Anikina, Nils Feldhus, Simon Ostermann, Sebastian M\"oller, Vera Schmitt</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language explanations (NLEs) are vital for elucidating the reasoning behind large language model (LLM) decisions. Many techniques have been developed to generate NLEs using LLMs. However, like humans, LLMs might not always produce optimal NLEs on first attempt. Inspired by human learning processes, we introduce Cross-Refine, which employs role modeling by deploying two LLMs as generator and critic, respectively. The generator outputs a first NLE and then refines this initial explanation using feedback and suggestions provided by the critic. Cross-Refine does not require any supervised training data or additional training. We validate Cross-Refine across three NLP tasks using three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs through automatic and human evaluation. We select Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) as the baseline, which only utilizes self-feedback to refine the explanations. Our findings from automatic evaluation and a user study indicate that Cross-Refine outperforms Self-Refine. Meanwhile, Cross-Refine can perform effectively with less powerful LLMs, whereas Self-Refine only yields strong results with ChatGPT. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess the importance of feedback and suggestions. Both of them play an important role in refining explanations. We further evaluate Cross-Refine on a bilingual dataset in English and German.</p>

<p>Abstract: excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Zhu, Shiyi Wang, Wenqing Zhong, Nianchen Shen, Yunqi Li, Siqi Wang, Zhiheng Li, Cathy Wu, Zhengbing He, Li Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gleb Mezentsev, Danil Gusak, Ivan Oseledets, Evgeny Frolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Scalability issue plays a crucial role in productionizing modern recommender systems. Even lightweight architectures may suffer from high computational overload due to intermediate calculations, limiting their practicality in real-world applications. Specifically, applying full Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often yields state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendations quality. Still, it suffers from excessive GPU memory utilization when dealing with large item catalogs. This paper introduces a novel Scalable Cross-Entropy (SCE) loss function in the sequential learning setup. It approximates the CE loss for datasets with large-size catalogs, enhancing both time efficiency and memory usage without compromising recommendations quality. Unlike traditional negative sampling methods, our approach utilizes a selective GPU-efficient computation strategy, focusing on the most informative elements of the catalog, particularly those most likely to be false positives. This is achieved by approximating the softmax distribution over a subset of the model outputs through the maximum inner product search. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCE in reducing peak memory usage by a factor of up to 100 compared to the alternatives, retaining or even exceeding their metrics values. The proposed approach also opens new perspectives for large-scale developments in different domains, such as large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation, especially in terms of keyframe interpolation. However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start & end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akihiro Fujii, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Koji Shimizu, Anh Khoa Augustin Lu, Satoshi Watanabe</p>
<p>Abstract: In materials science, finding crystal structures that have targeted properties is crucial. While recent methodologies such as Bayesian optimization and deep generative models have made some advances on this issue, these methods often face difficulties in adaptively incorporating various constraints, such as electrical neutrality and targeted properties optimization, while keeping the desired specific crystal structure. To address these challenges, we have developed the Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which utilizes state-of-the-art property prediction models and their gradients to directly optimize input crystal structures for targeted properties simultaneously. SMOACS enables the integration of adaptive constraints into the optimization process without necessitating model retraining. Thanks to this feature, SMOACS has succeeded in simultaneously optimizing targeted properties while maintaining perovskite structures, even with models trained on diverse crystal types. We have demonstrated the band gap optimization while meeting a challenging constraint, that is, maintaining electrical neutrality in large atomic configurations up to 135 atom sites, where the verification of the electrical neutrality is challenging. The properties of the most promising materials have been confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshara Prabhakar, Yuanzhi Li, Karthik Narasimhan, Sham Kakade, Eran Malach, Samy Jelassi</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). We study how different LoRA modules can be merged to achieve skill composition -- testing the performance of the merged model on a target task that involves combining multiple skills, each skill coming from a single LoRA. This setup is favorable when it is difficult to obtain training data for the target task and when it can be decomposed into multiple skills. First, we identify practically occurring use-cases that can be studied under the realm of skill composition, e.g. solving hard math-word problems with code, creating a bot to answer questions on proprietary manuals or about domain-specialized corpora. Our main contribution is to show that concatenation of LoRAs (CAT), which optimally weights LoRAs that were individually trained on different skills, outperforms existing model- and data- merging techniques; for instance on math-word problems, CAT beats these methods by an average of 43% and 12% respectively. Thus, this paper advocates model merging as an efficient way to solve compositional tasks and underscores CAT as a simple, compute-friendly and effective procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the superiority of model merging over data mixing for binary skill composition tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyuseong Choi, Jacob Feitelberg, Caleb Chin, Anish Agarwal, Raaz Dwivedi</p>
<p>Abstract: Consider a setting with multiple units (e.g., individuals, cohorts, geographic locations) and outcomes (e.g., treatments, times, items), where the goal is to learn a multivariate distribution for each unit-outcome entry, such as the distribution of a user's weekly spend and engagement under a specific mobile app version. A common challenge is the prevalence of missing not at random data, where observations are available only for certain unit-outcome combinations and the observation availability can be correlated with the properties of distributions themselves, i.e., there is unobserved confounding. An additional challenge is that for any observed unit-outcome entry, we only have a finite number of samples from the underlying distribution. We tackle these two challenges by casting the problem into a novel distributional matrix completion framework and introduce a kernel based distributional generalization of nearest neighbors to estimate the underlying distributions. By leveraging maximum mean discrepancies and a suitable factor model on the kernel mean embeddings of the underlying distributions, we establish consistent recovery of the underlying distributions even when data is missing not at random and positivity constraints are violated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our nearest neighbors approach is robust to heteroscedastic noise, provided we have access to two or more measurements for the observed unit-outcome entries, a robustness not present in prior works on nearest neighbors with single measurements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tassilo Wald, Constantin Ulrich, Stanislav Lukyanenko, Andrei Goncharov, Alberto Paderno, Leander Maerkisch, Paul F. J\"ager, Klaus Maier-Hein</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) presents an exciting opportunity to unlock the potential of vast, untapped clinical datasets, for various downstream applications that suffer from the scarcity of labeled data. While SSL has revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by three key pitfalls: Small pre-training dataset sizes, architectures inadequate for 3D medical image analysis, and insufficient evaluation practices. In this paper, we address these issues by i) leveraging a large-scale dataset of 39k 3D brain MRI volumes and ii) using a Residual Encoder U-Net architecture within the state-of-the-art nnU-Net framework. iii) A robust development framework, incorporating 5 development and 8 testing brain MRI segmentation datasets, allowed performance-driven design decisions to optimize the simple concept of Masked Auto Encoders (MAEs) for 3D CNNs. The resulting model not only surpasses previous SSL methods but also outperforms the strong nnU-Net baseline by an average of approximately 3 Dice points setting a new state-of-the-art. Our code and models are made available here.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mostafa Cherif, Tob\'ias I. Liaudat, Jonathan Kern, Christophe Kervazo, J\'er\^ome Bobin</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array promises to revolutionise our radio astronomy observational capabilities. The unprecedented volume of data these devices generate requires fast and accurate image reconstruction algorithms to solve the ill-posed radio interferometric imaging problem. Most state-of-the-art reconstruction methods lack trustworthy and scalable uncertainty quantification, which is critical for the rigorous scientific interpretation of radio observations. We propose an unsupervised technique based on a conformalized version of a radio-augmented equivariant bootstrapping method, which allows us to quantify uncertainties for fast reconstruction methods. Noticeably, we rely on reconstructions from ultra-fast unrolled algorithms. The proposed method brings more reliable uncertainty estimations to our problem than existing alternatives.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the second-placed solution for task 8 and the participation solution for task 7 of BraTS 2024. The adoption of automated brain analysis algorithms to support clinical practice is increasing. However, many of these algorithms struggle with the presence of brain lesions or the absence of certain MRI modalities. The alterations in the brain's morphology leads to high variability and thus poor performance of predictive models that were trained only on healthy brains. The lack of information that is usually provided by some of the missing MRI modalities also reduces the reliability of the prediction models trained with all modalities. In order to improve the performance of these models, we propose the use of conditional 3D wavelet diffusion models. The wavelet transform enabled full-resolution image training and prediction on a GPU with 48 GB VRAM, without patching or downsampling, preserving all information for prediction.

<p>Abstract: This paper presents the winning solution of task 1 and the third-placed solution of task 3 of the BraTS challenge. The use of automated tools in clinical practice has increased due to the development of more and more sophisticated and reliable algorithms. However, achieving clinical standards and developing tools for real-life scenarios is a major challenge. To this end, BraTS has organised tasks to find the most advanced solutions for specific purposes. In this paper, we propose the use of synthetic data to train state-of-the-art frameworks in order to improve the segmentation of adult gliomas in a post-treatment scenario, and the segmentation of meningioma for radiotherapy planning. Our results suggest that the use of synthetic data leads to more robust algorithms, although the synthetic data generation pipeline is not directly suited to the meningioma task. In task 1, we achieved a DSC of 0.7900, 0.8076, 0.7760, 0.8926, 0.7874, 0.8938 and a HD95 of 35.63, 30.35, 44.58, 16.87, 38.19, 17.95 for ET, NETC, RC, SNFH, TC and WT, respectively and, in task 3, we achieved a DSC of 0.801 and HD95 of 38.26, in the testing phase.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mallika Garg, Debashis Ghosh, Pyari Mohan Pradhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated remarkable success in many domains such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. With the growing interest in transformer-based architectures, they are now utilized for gesture recognition. So, we also explore and devise a novel ConvMixFormer architecture for dynamic hand gestures. The transformers use quadratic scaling of the attention features with the sequential data, due to which these models are computationally complex and heavy. We have considered this drawback of the transformer and designed a resource-efficient model that replaces the self-attention in the transformer with the simple convolutional layer-based token mixer. The computational cost and the parameters used for the convolution-based mixer are comparatively less than the quadratic self-attention. Convolution-mixer helps the model capture the local spatial features that self-attention struggles to capture due to their sequential processing nature. Further, an efficient gate mechanism is employed instead of a conventional feed-forward network in the transformer to help the model control the flow of features within different stages of the proposed model. This design uses fewer learnable parameters which is nearly half the vanilla transformer that helps in fast and efficient training. The proposed method is evaluated on NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture and Briareo datasets and our model has achieved state-of-the-art results on single and multimodal inputs. We have also shown the parameter efficiency of the proposed ConvMixFormer model compared to other methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/mallikagarg/ConvMixFormer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: This note introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. RD designs provide a quasi-experimental framework for estimating treatment effects, where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is the use of nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. However, the validity of these methods still relies on the consistency of the nonparametric estimators. In this study, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. The primary advantage of the DR-RD estimator lies in its ability to ensure the consistency of the treatment effect estimation as long as at least one of the two estimators is consistent. Consequently, our DR-RD estimator enhances robustness of treatment effect estimators in RD designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Ramos, Claudia Mamede, Kush Jain, Paulo Canelas, Catarina Gamboa, Claire Le Goues</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to various software engineering tasks, including code generation, bug detection, and repair. To evaluate model performance in these domains, numerous bug benchmarks containing real-world bugs from software projects have been developed. However, a growing concern within the software engineering community is that these benchmarks may not reliably reflect true LLM performance due to the risk of data leakage. Despite this concern, limited research has been conducted to quantify the impact of potential leakage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate popular LLMs to assess their susceptibility to data leakage from widely used bug benchmarks. To identify potential leakage, we use multiple metrics, including a study of benchmark membership within commonly used training datasets, as well as analyses of negative log-likelihood and n-gram accuracy. Our findings show that certain models, in particular codegen-multi, exhibit significant evidence of memorization in widely used benchmarks like Defects4J, while newer models trained on larger datasets like LLaMa 3.1 exhibit limited signs of leakage. These results highlight the need for careful benchmark selection and the adoption of robust metrics to adequately assess models capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anika Tahsin Meem</p>
<p>Abstract: In modern times, the cryptocurrency market is one of the world's most rapidly rising financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is regarded to be more volatile and illiquid than traditional markets such as equities, foreign exchange, and commodities. The risk of this market creates an uncertain condition among the investors. The purpose of this research is to predict the magnitude of the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market. Risk factor is also called volatility. Our approach will assist people who invest in the cryptocurrency market by overcoming the problems and difficulties they experience. Our approach starts with calculating the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market from the existing parameters. In twenty elements of the cryptocurrency market, the risk factor has been predicted using different machine learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. All of the models have been applied to the calculated risk factor parameter. A new model has been developed to predict better than the existing models. Our proposed model gives the highest RMSE value of 1.3229 and the lowest RMSE value of 0.0089. Following our model, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin, etc. Where the other existing models, the highest RMSE was 14.5092, and the lower was 0.02769. So, the proposed model performs much better than models with proper generalization. Using our approach, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fine-grained alignment in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, where robots navigate realistic 3D environments based on natural language instructions. Current approaches use contrastive learning to align language with visual trajectory sequences. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties with fine-grained vision negatives. To enhance cross-modal embeddings, we introduce a novel Bayesian Optimization-based adversarial optimization framework for creating fine-grained contrastive vision samples. To validate the proposed methodology, we conduct a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness of the enriched embeddings on fine-grained vision negatives. We conduct experiments on two common VLN benchmarks R2R and REVERIE, experiments on the them demonstrate that these embeddings benefit navigation, and can lead to a promising performance enhancement.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OminiControl, a highly versatile and parameter-efficient framework that integrates image conditions into pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models. At its core, OminiControl leverages a parameter reuse mechanism, enabling the DiT to encode image conditions using itself as a powerful backbone and process them with its flexible multi-modal attention processors. Unlike existing methods, which rely heavily on additional encoder modules with complex architectures, OminiControl (1) effectively and efficiently incorporates injected image conditions with only ~0.1% additional parameters, and (2) addresses a wide range of image conditioning tasks in a unified manner, including subject-driven generation and spatially-aligned conditions such as edges, depth, and more. Remarkably, these capabilities are achieved by training on images generated by the DiT itself, which is particularly beneficial for subject-driven generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that OminiControl outperforms existing UNet-based and DiT-adapted models in both subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditional generation. Additionally, we release our training dataset, Subjects200K, a diverse collection of over 200,000 identity-consistent images, along with an efficient data synthesis pipeline to advance research in subject-consistent generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aycan Deniz Vit, Ujal Rzayev, Bahrem Serhat Danis, Ali Najjar Amiri, Kazim Gorgulu, Emir Salih Magden</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel design paradigm for arbitrarily capable deep photonic networks of cascaded Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) for on-chip universal polarization handling. Using a device architecture made of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we modify and train the phase difference between interferometer arms for both polarizations through wide operation bandwidths. Three proof-of-concept polarization handling devices are illustrated using a software-defined, physics-informed neural framework, to achieve user-specified target device responses as functions of polarization and wavelength. These devices include a polarization splitter, a polarization-independent power splitter, and an arbitrary polarization-dependent splitter to illustrate the capabilities of the design framework. The performance for all three devices is optimized using transfer matrix calculations; and their final responses are verified through 3D-FDTD simulations. All devices demonstrate state-of-the-art performance metrics with over 20 dB extinction, and flat-top transmission bands through bandwidths of 120 nm. In addition to the functional diversity enabled, the optimization for each device is completed in under a minute, highlighting the computational efficiency of the design paradigm presented. These results demonstrate the versatility of the deep photonic network design ecosystem in polarization management, unveiling promising prospects for advanced on-chip applications in optical communications, sensing, and computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sylvain Sardy, Maxime van Cutsem, Xiaoyu Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: The motivation for sparse learners is to compress the inputs (features) by selecting only the ones needed for good generalization. Linear models with LASSO-type regularization achieve this by setting the weights of irrelevant features to zero, effectively identifying and ignoring them. In artificial neural networks, this selective focus can be achieved by pruning the input layer. Given a cost function enhanced with a sparsity-promoting penalty, our proposal selects a regularization term $\lambda$ (without the use of cross-validation or a validation set) that creates a local minimum in the cost function at the origin where no features are selected. This local minimum acts as a baseline, meaning that if there is no strong enough signal to justify a feature inclusion, the local minimum remains at zero with a high prescribed probability. The method is flexible, applying to complex models ranging from shallow to deep artificial neural networks and supporting various cost functions and sparsity-promoting penalties. We empirically show a remarkable phase transition in the probability of retrieving the relevant features, as well as good generalization thanks to the choice of $\lambda$, the non-convex penalty and the optimization scheme developed. This approach can be seen as a form of compressed sensing for complex models, allowing us to distill high-dimensional data into a compact, interpretable subset of meaningful features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahriar Soudeep, M. F. Mridha, Md Abrar Jahin, Nilanjan Dey</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate detection and tracking of small objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes are critical for traffic surveillance systems, which are crucial in improving road safety and decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional methods struggle with challenges such as occlusion, low resolution, and dynamic traffic conditions, necessitating innovative approaches to address these limitations. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework integrating dynamic graph neural networks (DGNN) with YOLO11 to enhance small object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance systems. The framework leverages YOLO11's advanced spatial feature extraction capabilities for precise object detection and incorporates DGNN to model spatial-temporal relationships for robust real-time tracking dynamically. By constructing and updating graph structures, DGNN-YOLO effectively represents objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, ensuring adaptive and accurate tracking in complex and dynamic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGNN-YOLO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting and tracking small objects under diverse traffic conditions, achieving the highest precision (0.8382), recall (0.6875), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (0.6476), showcasing its robustness and scalability, particularly in challenging scenarios involving small and occluded objects. This work provides a scalable, real-time traffic surveillance and analysis solution, significantly contributing to intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Corey Lammie, Manuel Le Gallo, Bipin Rajendran</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck, accelerating neural network computations and improving computational efficiency. While AIMC has demonstrated success with architectures such as CNNs, MLPs, and RNNs, deploying transformer-based models using AIMC presents unique challenges. Transformers are expected to handle diverse downstream tasks and adapt to new user data or instructions after deployment, which requires more flexible approaches to suit AIMC constraints.
  In this paper, we propose a novel method for deploying pre-trained transformer models onto AIMC hardware. Unlike traditional approaches requiring hardware-aware training, our technique allows direct deployment without the need for retraining the original model. Instead, we utilize lightweight, low-rank adapters -- compact modules stored in digital cores -- to adapt the model to hardware constraints. We validate our approach on MobileBERT, demonstrating accuracy on par with, or even exceeding, a traditional hardware-aware training approach. Our method is particularly appealing in multi-task scenarios, as it enables a single analog model to be reused across multiple tasks. Moreover, it supports on-chip adaptation to new hardware constraints and tasks without updating analog weights, providing a flexible and versatile solution for real-world AI applications. Code is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kesen Wang, Marc G. Genton</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent decades, statisticians have been increasingly encountering spatial data that exhibit non-Gaussian behaviors such as asymmetry and heavy-tailedness. As a result, the assumptions of symmetry and fixed tail weight in Gaussian processes have become restrictive and may fail to capture the intrinsic properties of the data. To address the limitations of the Gaussian models, a variety of skewed models has been proposed, of which the popularity has grown rapidly. These skewed models introduce parameters that govern skewness and tail weight. Among various proposals in the literature, unified skewed distributions, such as the Unified Skew-Normal (SUN), have received considerable attention. In this work, we revisit a more concise and intepretable re-parameterization of the SUN distribution and apply the distribution to random fields by constructing a generalized unified skew-normal (GSUN) spatial process. We demonstrate that the GSUN is a valid spatial process by showing its vanishing correlation in large distances and provide the corresponding spatial interpolation method. In addition, we develop an inference mechanism for the GSUN process using the concept of neural Bayes estimators with deep graphical attention networks (GATs) and encoder transformer. We show the superiority of our proposed estimator over the conventional CNN-based architectures regarding stability and accuracy by means of a simulation study and application to Pb-contaminated soil data. Furthermore, we show that the GSUN process is different from the conventional Gaussian processes and Tukey g-and-h processes, through the probability integral transform (PIT).</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17593">What Differentiates Educational Literature? A Multimodal Fusion Approach of Transformers and Computational Linguistics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jordan J. Bird</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of new literature into the English curriculum remains a challenge since educators often lack scalable tools to rapidly evaluate readability and adapt texts for diverse classroom needs. This study proposes to address this gap through a multimodal approach that combines transformer-based text classification with linguistic feature analysis to align texts with UK Key Stages. Eight state-of-the-art Transformers were fine-tuned on segmented text data, with BERT achieving the highest unimodal F1 score of 0.75. In parallel, 500 deep neural network topologies were searched for the classification of linguistic characteristics, achieving an F1 score of 0.392. The fusion of these modalities shows a significant improvement, with every multimodal approach outperforming all unimodal models. In particular, the ELECTRA Transformer fused with the neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.996. Unimodal and multimodal approaches are shown to have statistically significant differences in all validation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) except for inference time. The proposed approach is finally encapsulated in a stakeholder-facing web application, providing non-technical stakeholder access to real-time insights on text complexity, reading difficulty, curriculum alignment, and recommendations for learning age range. The application empowers data-driven decision making and reduces manual workload by integrating AI-based recommendations into lesson planning for English literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhay Shanbhag, Suramya Jadhav, Amogh Thakurdesai, Ridhima Sinare, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages presents significant challenges, particularly due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and linguistic resources. The choice of embeddings plays a critical role in enhancing the performance of NLP tasks, such as news classification, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection, especially for low-resource languages like Marathi. In this study, we investigate the impact of various embedding techniques- Contextual BERT-based, Non-Contextual BERT-based, and FastText-based on NLP classification tasks specific to the Marathi language. Our research includes a thorough evaluation of both compressed and uncompressed embeddings, providing a comprehensive overview of how these embeddings perform across different scenarios. Specifically, we compare two BERT model embeddings, Muril and MahaBERT, as well as two FastText model embeddings, IndicFT and MahaFT. Our evaluation includes applying embeddings to a Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR) classifier for task performance assessment, as well as TSNE visualizations to observe the spatial distribution of these embeddings. The results demonstrate that contextual embeddings outperform non-contextual embeddings. Furthermore, BERT-based non-contextual embeddings extracted from the first BERT embedding layer yield better results than FastText-based embeddings, suggesting a potential alternative to FastText embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahan Li, Chaoran Cheng, Jianzhu Ma, Ge Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Shape assembly, which aims to reassemble separate parts into a complete object, has gained significant interest in recent years. Existing methods primarily rely on networks to predict the poses of individual parts, but often fail to effectively capture the geometric interactions between the parts and their poses. In this paper, we present the Geometric Point Attention Transformer (GPAT), a network specifically designed to address the challenges of reasoning about geometric relationships. In the geometric point attention module, we integrate both global shape information and local pairwise geometric features, along with poses represented as rotation and translation vectors for each part. To enable iterative updates and dynamic reasoning, we introduce a geometric recycling scheme, where each prediction is fed into the next iteration for refinement. We evaluate our model on both the semantic and geometric assembly tasks, showing that it outperforms previous methods in absolute pose estimation, achieving accurate pose predictions and high alignment accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangqi Li, Hieu Le, Jingyi Xu, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating realistic images from arbitrary text prompts. However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungbin Cho, Junwan Kim, Jisoo Kim, Minseo Kim, Mingu Kang, Sungeun Hong, Tae-Hyun Oh, Youngjae Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Human motion, inherently continuous and dynamic, presents significant challenges for generative models. Despite their dominance, discrete quantization methods, such as VQ-VAEs, suffer from inherent limitations, including restricted expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. Continuous approaches, while producing smoother and more natural motions, often falter due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this "discord" between discrete and continuous representations, we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that decodes discrete motion tokens into continuous motion through rectified flow. By employing an iterative refinement process in the continuous space, DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and ensures smoother and more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DisCoRD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with FID of 0.032 on HumanML3D and 0.169 on KIT-ML. These results solidify DisCoRD as a robust solution for bridging the divide between discrete efficiency and continuous realism.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19943">Critical Tokens Matter: Token-Level Contrastive Estimation Enhances LLM&#x27;s Reasoning Capability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zicheng Lin, Tian Liang, Jiahao Xu, Xing Wang, Ruilin Luo, Chufan Shi, Siheng Li, Yujiu Yang, Zhaopeng Tu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on reasoning tasks. They utilize autoregressive token generation to construct reasoning trajectories, enabling the development of a coherent chain of thought. In this work, we explore the impact of individual tokens on the final outcomes of reasoning tasks. We identify the existence of ``critical tokens'' that lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories in LLMs. Specifically, we find that LLMs tend to produce positive outcomes when forced to decode other tokens instead of critical tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel approach - cDPO - designed to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for the critical tokens during the alignment process. Specifically, we develop a contrastive estimation approach to automatically identify critical tokens. It is achieved by comparing the generation likelihood of positive and negative models. To achieve this, we separately fine-tune the positive and negative models on various reasoning trajectories, consequently, they are capable of identifying identify critical tokens within incorrect trajectories that contribute to erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to further align the model with the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential likelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important weight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19951">T2Vid: Translating Long Text into Multi-Image is the Catalyst for Video-LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shukang Yin, Chaoyou Fu, Sirui Zhao, Yunhang Shen, Chunjiang Ge, Yan Yang, Zuwei Long, Yuhan Dai, Tong Xu, Xing Sun, Ran He, Caifeng Shan, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain has garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous successful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the success to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data. The code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.</p>
