<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiyue Huang, Chi Hong, Lydia Y. Chen, Stefanie Roos</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are becoming defector generative models, which generate exceptionally high-resolution image data. Training effective diffusion models require massive real data, which is privately owned by distributed parties. Each data party can collaboratively train diffusion models in a federated learning manner by sharing gradients instead of the raw data. In this paper, we study the privacy leakage risk of gradient inversion attacks. First, we design a two-phase fusion optimization, GIDM, to leverage the well-trained generative model itself as prior knowledge to constrain the inversion search (latent) space, followed by pixel-wise fine-tuning. GIDM is shown to be able to reconstruct images almost identical to the original ones. Considering a more privacy-preserving training scenario, we then argue that locally initialized private training noise $\epsilon$ and sampling step t may raise additional challenges for the inversion attack. To solve this, we propose a triple-optimization GIDM+ that coordinates the optimization of the unknown data, $\epsilon$ and $t$. Our extensive evaluation results demonstrate the vulnerability of sharing gradient for data protection of diffusion models, even high-resolution images can be reconstructed with high quality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20421">Worse than Random? An Embarrassingly Simple Probing Evaluation of Large Multimodal Models in Medical VQA</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianqi Yan, Xuehai He, Xiang Yue, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in the field of medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), achieving high accuracy on existing benchmarks. However, their reliability under robust evaluation is questionable. This study reveals that state-of-the-art models, when subjected to simple probing evaluation, perform worse than random guessing on medical diagnosis questions. To address this critical evaluation problem, we introduce the Probing Evaluation for Medical Diagnosis (ProbMed) dataset to rigorously assess LMM performance in medical imaging through probing evaluation and procedural diagnosis. Particularly, probing evaluation features pairing original questions with negation questions with hallucinated attributes, while procedural diagnosis requires reasoning across various diagnostic dimensions for each image, including modality recognition, organ identification, clinical findings, abnormalities, and positional grounding. Our evaluation reveals that top-performing models like GPT-4V and Gemini Pro perform worse than random guessing on specialized diagnostic questions, indicating significant limitations in handling fine-grained medical inquiries. Besides, models like LLaVA-Med struggle even with more general questions, and results from CheXagent demonstrate the transferability of expertise across different modalities of the same organ, showing that specialized domain knowledge is still crucial for improving performance. This study underscores the urgent need for more robust evaluation to ensure the reliability of LMMs in critical fields like medical diagnosis, and current LMMs are still far from applicable to those fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuta Kawakami, Manabu Kuroki, Jin Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Probabilities of causation (PoC) are valuable concepts for explainable artificial intelligence and practical decision-making. PoC are originally defined for scalar binary variables. In this paper, we extend the concept of PoC to continuous treatment and outcome variables, and further generalize PoC to capture causal effects between multiple treatments and multiple outcomes. In addition, we consider PoC for a sub-population and PoC with multi-hypothetical terms to capture more sophisticated counterfactual information useful for decision-making. We provide a nonparametric identification theorem for each type of PoC we introduce. Finally, we illustrate the application of our results on a real-world dataset about education.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20519">Diffusion On Syntax Trees For Program Synthesis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Kapur, Erik Jenner, Stuart Russell</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models generate code one token at a time. Their autoregressive generation process lacks the feedback of observing the program's output. Training LLMs to suggest edits directly can be challenging due to the scarcity of rich edit data. To address these problems, we propose neural diffusion models that operate on syntax trees of any context-free grammar. Similar to image diffusion models, our method also inverts ``noise'' applied to syntax trees. Rather than generating code sequentially, we iteratively edit it while preserving syntactic validity, which makes it easy to combine this neural model with search. We apply our approach to inverse graphics tasks, where our model learns to convert images into programs that produce those images. Combined with search, our model is able to write graphics programs, see the execution result, and debug them to meet the required specifications. We additionally show how our system can write graphics programs for hand-drawn sketches.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20526">Automated Generation and Tagging of Knowledge Components from Multiple-Choice Questions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Moore, Robin Schmucker, Tom Mitchell, John Stamper</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) linked to assessments enhance the measurement of student learning, enrich analytics, and facilitate adaptivity. However, generating and linking KCs to assessment items requires significant effort and domain-specific knowledge. To streamline this process for higher-education courses, we employed GPT-4 to generate KCs for multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Chemistry and E-Learning. We analyzed discrepancies between the KCs generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) and those made by humans through evaluation from three domain experts in each subject area. This evaluation aimed to determine whether, in instances of non-matching KCs, evaluators showed a preference for the LLM-generated KCs over their human-created counterparts. We also developed an ontology induction algorithm to cluster questions that assess similar KCs based on their content. Our most effective LLM strategy accurately matched KCs for 56% of Chemistry and 35% of E-Learning MCQs, with even higher success when considering the top five KC suggestions. Human evaluators favored LLM-generated KCs, choosing them over human-assigned ones approximately two-thirds of the time, a preference that was statistically significant across both domains. Our clustering algorithm successfully grouped questions by their underlying KCs without needing explicit labels or contextual information. This research advances the automation of KC generation and classification for assessment items, alleviating the need for student data or predefined KC labels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steven Moore, Eamon Costello, Huy A. Nguyen, John Stamper</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) involves either labor intensive human assessments or automated methods that prioritize readability, often overlooking deeper question design flaws. To address this issue, we introduce the Scalable Automatic Question Usability Evaluation Toolkit (SAQUET), an open-source tool that leverages the Item-Writing Flaws (IWF) rubric for a comprehensive and automated quality evaluation of MCQs. By harnessing the latest in large language models such as GPT-4, advanced word embeddings, and Transformers designed to analyze textual complexity, SAQUET effectively pinpoints and assesses a wide array of flaws in MCQs. We first demonstrate the discrepancy between commonly used automated evaluation metrics and the human assessment of MCQ quality. Then we evaluate SAQUET on a diverse dataset of MCQs across the five domains of Chemistry, Statistics, Computer Science, Humanities, and Healthcare, showing how it effectively distinguishes between flawed and flawless questions, providing a level of analysis beyond what is achievable with traditional metrics. With an accuracy rate of over 94% in detecting the presence of flaws identified by human evaluators, our findings emphasize the limitations of existing evaluation methods and showcase potential in improving the quality of educational assessments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlu Zhang, Zhiyu Zoey Chen, Xi Ye, Xianjun Yang, Lichang Chen, William Yang Wang, Linda Ruth Petzold</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) significantly enhances the zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). While coding data is known to boost reasoning abilities during LLM pretraining, its role in activating internal reasoning capacities during IFT remains understudied. This paper investigates a key question: How does coding data impact LLMs' reasoning capacities during the IFT stage? To explore this, we thoroughly examine the impact of coding data across different coding data proportions, model families, sizes, and reasoning domains, from various perspectives. Specifically, we create three IFT datasets with increasing coding data proportions, fine-tune six LLM backbones across different families and scales on these datasets, evaluate the tuned models' performance across twelve tasks in three reasoning domains, and analyze the outcomes from three broad-to-granular perspectives: overall, domain-level, and task-specific. Our holistic analysis provides valuable insights in each perspective. First, coding data tuning enhances the overall reasoning capabilities of LLMs across different model families and scales. Moreover, the effect of coding data varies among different domains but shows consistent trends across model families and scales within each domain. Additionally, coding data generally yields comparable task-specific benefits across different model families, with the optimal coding data proportions in IFT datasets being task-specific.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaicheng Fu, Changde Du, Xiaoyu Chen, Jie Peng, Huiguang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion decoding plays an important role in affective human-computer interaction. However, previous studies ignored the dynamic real-world scenario, where human experience a blend of multiple emotions which are incrementally integrated into the model, leading to the multi-label class incremental learning (MLCIL) problem. Existing methods have difficulty in solving MLCIL issue due to notorious catastrophic forgetting caused by partial label problem and inadequate label semantics mining. In this paper, we propose an augmented emotional semantics learning framework for multi-label class incremental emotion decoding. Specifically, we design an augmented emotional relation graph module with label disambiguation to handle the past-missing partial label problem. Then, we leverage domain knowledge from affective dimension space to alleviate future-missing partial label problem by knowledge distillation. Besides, an emotional semantics learning module is constructed with a graph autoencoder to obtain emotion embeddings in order to guide the semantic-specific feature decoupling for better multi-label learning. Extensive experiments on three datasets show the superiority of our method for improving emotion decoding performance and mitigating forgetting on MLCIL problem.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20625">Robust Planning with LLM-Modulo Framework: Case Study in Travel Planning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Atharva Gundawar, Mudit Verma, Lin Guan, Karthik Valmeekam, Siddhant Bhambri, Subbarao Kambhampati</p>
<p>Abstract: As the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) extends beyond traditional text processing tasks, there is a burgeoning interest in their potential to excel in planning and reasoning assignments, realms traditionally reserved for System 2 cognitive competencies. Despite their perceived versatility, the research community is still unraveling effective strategies to harness these models in such complex domains. The recent discourse introduced by the paper on LLM Modulo marks a significant stride, proposing a conceptual framework that enhances the integration of LLMs into diverse planning and reasoning activities. This workshop paper delves into the practical application of this framework within the domain of travel planning, presenting a specific instance of its implementation. We are using the Travel Planning benchmark by the OSU NLP group, a benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLMs in producing valid itineraries based on user queries presented in natural language. While popular methods of enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs such as Chain of Thought, ReAct, and Reflexion achieve a meager 0%, 0.6%, and 0% with GPT3.5-Turbo respectively, our operationalization of the LLM-Modulo framework for TravelPlanning domain provides a remarkable improvement, enhancing baseline performances by 4.6x for GPT4-Turbo and even more for older models like GPT3.5-Turbo from 0% to 5%. Furthermore, we highlight the other useful roles of LLMs in the planning pipeline, as suggested in LLM-Modulo, which can be reliably operationalized such as extraction of useful critics and reformulator for critics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishanu Maity, A. S. Poornash, Sriparna Saha, Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era of rapidly evolving internet technology, the surge in multimodal content, including videos, has expanded the horizons of online communication. However, the detection of toxic content in this diverse landscape, particularly in low-resource code-mixed languages, remains a critical challenge. While substantial research has addressed toxic content detection in textual data, the realm of video content, especially in non-English languages, has been relatively underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by introducing a benchmark dataset, the first of its kind, consisting of 931 videos with 4021 code-mixed Hindi-English utterances collected from YouTube. Each utterance within this dataset has been meticulously annotated for toxicity, severity, and sentiment labels. We have developed an advanced Multimodal Multitask framework built for Toxicity detection in Video Content by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), crafted for the primary objective along with the additional tasks of conducting sentiment and severity analysis. ToxVidLLM incorporates three key modules the Encoder module, Cross-Modal Synchronization module, and Multitask module crafting a generic multimodal LLM customized for intricate video classification tasks. Our experiments reveal that incorporating multiple modalities from the videos substantially enhances the performance of toxic content detection by achieving an Accuracy and Weighted F1 score of 94.29% and 94.35%, respectively.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20653">Enhancing Jailbreak Attack Against Large Language Models through Silent Tokens</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Yu, Haozheng Luo, Jerry Yao-Chieh, Wenbo Guo, Han Liu, Xinyu Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Along with the remarkable successes of Language language models, recent research also started to explore the security threats of LLMs, including jailbreaking attacks. Attackers carefully craft jailbreaking prompts such that a target LLM will respond to the harmful question. Existing jailbreaking attacks require either human experts or leveraging complicated algorithms to craft jailbreaking prompts. In this paper, we introduce BOOST, a simple attack that leverages only the eos tokens. We demonstrate that rather than constructing complicated jailbreaking prompts, the attacker can simply append a few eos tokens to the end of a harmful question. It will bypass the safety alignment of LLMs and lead to successful jailbreaking attacks. We further apply BOOST to four representative jailbreak methods and show that the attack success rates of these methods can be significantly enhanced by simply adding eos tokens to the prompt. To understand this simple but novel phenomenon, we conduct empirical analyses. Our analysis reveals that adding eos tokens makes the target LLM believe the input is much less harmful, and eos tokens have low attention values and do not affect LLM's understanding of the harmful questions, leading the model to actually respond to the questions. Our findings uncover how fragile an LLM is against jailbreak attacks, motivating the development of strong safety alignment approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The analysis of the field traps where the mosquitoes insert their eggs is vital to check that the sterile insect technique (SIT) is working properly. This is because the number of hatched eggs may indicate that the sterile males are not competing with the wild ones. Nowadays, the study of the traps is done manually by microscope and is very time-consuming and prone to human error. This paper presents an automatic trap survey. For this purpose, a device has been designed that automatically scans the slat obtaining different overlapping photos. Subsequently, the images are analyzed by a Mask-RCNN neural network that segments the eggs and classifies them into 2 classes: full or hatch</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingda Li, Xinyu Li, Yifan Chen, Wenfeng Xuan, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RALMs) demonstrate their superiority in terms of factuality, they do not consistently outperform the original retrieval-free Language Models (LMs). Our experiments reveal that this example-level performance inconsistency exists not only between retrieval-augmented and retrieval-free LM but also among different retrievers. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the degeneration behavior of RALMs and theoretically decompose it into four categories. Further analysis based on our decomposition reveals that the innate difference in knowledge sources and the unpredictable degeneration of the reader model contribute most to the inconsistency. Drawing from our analysis, we introduce Ensemble of Retrievers (EoR), a trainable framework that can adaptively retrieve from different knowledge sources and effectively decrease unpredictable reader errors. Our experiments on Open Domain Question Answering show that EoR substantially improves performance over the RALM with a single retriever by considerably reducing inconsistent behaviors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern industrial fault diagnosis tasks often face the combined challenge of distribution discrepancy and bi-imbalance. Existing domain adaptation approaches pay little attention to the prevailing bi-imbalance, leading to poor domain adaptation performance or even negative transfer. In this work, we propose a self-degraded contrastive domain adaptation (Sd-CDA) diagnosis framework to handle the domain discrepancy under the bi-imbalanced data. It first pre-trains the feature extractor via imbalance-aware contrastive learning based on model pruning to learn the feature representation efficiently in a self-supervised manner. Then it forces the samples away from the domain boundary based on supervised contrastive domain adversarial learning (SupCon-DA) and ensures the features generated by the feature extractor are discriminative enough. Furthermore, we propose the pruned contrastive domain adversarial learning (PSupCon-DA) to pay automatically re-weighted attention to the minorities to enhance the performance towards bi-imbalanced data. We show the superiority of the proposed method via two experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S\"oren Schleibaum, Lu Feng, Sarit Kraus, J\"org P. M\"uller</p>
<p>Abstract: In the evolving landscape of human-centered AI, fostering a synergistic relationship between humans and AI agents in decision-making processes stands as a paramount challenge. This work considers a problem setup where an intelligent agent comprising a neural network-based prediction component and a deep reinforcement learning component provides advice to a human decision-maker in complex repeated decision-making environments. Whether the human decision-maker would follow the agent's advice depends on their beliefs and trust in the agent and on their understanding of the advice itself. To this end, we developed an approach named ADESSE to generate explanations about the adviser agent to improve human trust and decision-making. Computational experiments on a range of environments with varying model sizes demonstrate the applicability and scalability of ADESSE. Furthermore, an interactive game-based user study shows that participants were significantly more satisfied, achieved a higher reward in the game, and took less time to select an action when presented with explanations generated by ADESSE. These findings illuminate the critical role of tailored, human-centered explanations in AI-assisted decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: Predictions of global climate models typically operate on coarse spatial scales due to the large computational costs of climate simulations. This has led to a considerable interest in methods for statistical downscaling, a similar process to super-resolution in the computer vision context, to provide more local and regional climate information. In this work, we apply conditional normalizing flows to the task of climate variable downscaling. We showcase its successful performance on an ERA5 water content dataset for different upsampling factors. Additionally, we show that the method allows us to assess the predictive uncertainty in terms of standard deviation from the fitted conditional distribution mean.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Yu, Hao Fang, Bin Chen, Xiaohang Sui, Chuan Chen, Hao Wu, Shu-Tao Xia, Ke Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urban heat islands, defined as specific zones exhibiting substantially higher temperatures than their immediate environs, pose significant threats to environmental sustainability and public health. This study introduces a novel machine-learning model that amalgamates data from the Sentinel-3 satellite, meteorological predictions, and additional remote sensing inputs. The primary aim is to generate detailed spatiotemporal maps that forecast the peak temperatures within a 24-hour period in Turin. Experimental results validate the model's proficiency in predicting temperature patterns, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.09 degrees Celsius for the year 2023 at a resolution of 20 meters per pixel, thereby enriching our knowledge of urban climatic behavior.

<p>Abstract: OpenTensor is a reproduction of AlphaTensor, which discovered a new algorithm that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for matrix multiplication by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While AlphaTensor provides a promising framework for solving scientific problems, it is really hard to reproduce due to the massive tricks and lack of source codes. In this paper, we clean up the algorithm pipeline, clarify the technical details, and make some improvements to the training process. Computational results show that OpenTensor can successfully find efficient matrix multiplication algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert West, Roland Aydin</p>
<p>Abstract: The field of AI alignment aims to steer AI systems toward human goals, preferences, and ethical principles. Its contributions have been instrumental for improving the output quality, safety, and trustworthiness of today's AI models. This perspective article draws attention to a fundamental challenge inherent in all AI alignment endeavors, which we term the "AI alignment paradox": The better we align AI models with our values, the easier we make it for adversaries to misalign the models. We illustrate the paradox by sketching three concrete example incarnations for the case of language models, each corresponding to a distinct way in which adversaries can exploit the paradox. With AI's increasing real-world impact, it is imperative that a broad community of researchers be aware of the AI alignment paradox and work to find ways to break out of it, in order to ensure the beneficial use of AI for the good of humanity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Norman, Francois Rivest</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient utilization of satellite resources in dynamic environments remains a challenging problem in satellite scheduling. This paper addresses the multi-satellite collection scheduling problem (m-SatCSP), aiming to optimize task scheduling over a constellation of satellites under uncertain conditions such as cloud cover. Leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a stochastic search algorithm, two versions of MCTS are explored to schedule satellites effectively. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize the algorithm's performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MCTS approach, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and efficiency. Comparative analysis against other scheduling algorithms showcases competitive performance, positioning MCTS as a promising solution for satellite task scheduling in dynamic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Piotr Wojciech Mirowski, Juliette Love, Kory W. Mathewson, Shakir Mohamed</p>
<p>Abstract: We interviewed twenty professional comedians who perform live shows in front of audiences and who use artificial intelligence in their artistic process as part of 3-hour workshops on ``AI x Comedy'' conducted at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2023 and online. The workshop consisted of a comedy writing session with large language models (LLMs), a human-computer interaction questionnaire to assess the Creativity Support Index of AI as a writing tool, and a focus group interrogating the comedians' motivations for and processes of using AI, as well as their ethical concerns about bias, censorship and copyright. Participants noted that existing moderation strategies used in safety filtering and instruction-tuned LLMs reinforced hegemonic viewpoints by erasing minority groups and their perspectives, and qualified this as a form of censorship. At the same time, most participants felt the LLMs did not succeed as a creativity support tool, by producing bland and biased comedy tropes, akin to ``cruise ship comedy material from the 1950s, but a bit less racist''. Our work extends scholarship about the subtle difference between, one the one hand, harmful speech, and on the other hand, ``offensive'' language as a practice of resistance, satire and ``punching up''. We also interrogate the global value alignment behind such language models, and discuss the importance of community-based value alignment and data ownership to build AI tools that better suit artists' needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria F. Davila R., Sven Groen, Fabian Panse, Wolfram Wingerath</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era of rapidly advancing data-driven applications, there is a growing demand for data in both research and practice. Synthetic data have emerged as an alternative when no real data is available (e.g., due to privacy regulations). Synthesizing tabular data presents unique and complex challenges, especially handling (i) missing values, (ii) dataset imbalance, (iii) diverse column types, and (iv) complex data distributions, as well as preserving (i) column correlations, (ii) temporal dependencies, and (iii) integrity constraints (e.g., functional dependencies) present in the original dataset. While substantial progress has been made recently in the context of generational models, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for tabular data today, and choosing the right tool for a given task is therefore no trivial task. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS), examine the needs of users by defining a set of functional and non-functional requirements, and compile the challenges associated with meeting those needs. In addition, we evaluate the reported performance of 36 popular research TDS tools about these requirements and develop a decision guide to help users find suitable TDS tools for their applications. The resulting decision guide also identifies significant research gaps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiteng Fang, Yuelin Bai, Shiwen Ni, Min Yang, Xiaojun Chen, Ruifeng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial capabilities yet encounter challenges, including hallucination, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, integrating knowledge from external databases to mitigate these challenges. However, inappropriate retrieved passages can potentially hinder the LLMs' capacity to generate comprehensive and high-quality responses. Prior RAG studies on the robustness of retrieval noises often confine themselves to a limited set of noise types, deviating from real-world retrieval environments and limiting practical applicability. In this study, we initially investigate retrieval noises and categorize them into three distinct types, reflecting real-world environments. We analyze the impact of these various retrieval noises on the robustness of LLMs. Subsequently, we propose a novel RAG approach known as Retrieval-augmented Adaptive Adversarial Training (RAAT). RAAT leverages adaptive adversarial training to dynamically adjust the model's training process in response to retrieval noises. Concurrently, it employs multi-task learning to ensure the model's capacity to internally recognize noisy contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LLaMA-2 7B model trained using RAAT exhibits significant improvements in F1 and EM scores under diverse noise conditions. For reproducibility, we release our code and data at: https://github.com/calubkk/RAAT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matej Gazda, Samuel Kadoury, Jakub Gazda, Peter Drotar</p>
<p>Abstract: Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is a fundamental, non-invasive diagnostic tool in cardiovascular medicine, enabling detailed visualization of cardiac structures crucial for diagnosing various heart conditions. Despite its widespread use, TTE ultrasound imaging faces inherent limitations, notably the trade-off between field of view (FoV) and resolution. This paper introduces a novel application of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), specifically designed to extend the FoV in TTE ultrasound imaging while maintaining high resolution. Our proposed cGAN architecture, termed echoGAN, demonstrates the capability to generate realistic anatomical structures through outpainting, effectively broadening the viewable area in medical imaging. This advancement has the potential to enhance both automatic and manual ultrasound navigation, offering a more comprehensive view that could significantly reduce the learning curve associated with ultrasound imaging and aid in more accurate diagnoses. The results confirm that echoGAN reliably reproduce detailed cardiac features, thereby promising a significant step forward in the field of non-invasive cardiac naviagation and diagnostics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel A. Herrmann, Benjamin A. Levinstein</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to demonstrate remarkable abilities across various domains, computer scientists are developing methods to understand their cognitive processes, particularly concerning how (and if) LLMs internally represent their beliefs about the world. However, this field currently lacks a unified theoretical foundation to underpin the study of belief in LLMs. This article begins filling this gap by proposing adequacy conditions for a representation in an LLM to count as belief-like. We argue that, while the project of belief measurement in LLMs shares striking features with belief measurement as carried out in decision theory and formal epistemology, it also differs in ways that should change how we measure belief. Thus, drawing from insights in philosophy and contemporary practices of machine learning, we establish four criteria that balance theoretical considerations with practical constraints. Our proposed criteria include accuracy, coherence, uniformity, and use, which together help lay the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of belief representation in LLMs. We draw on empirical work showing the limitations of using various criteria in isolation to identify belief representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanghee Park, Jiayu Wang, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Nadia Polikarpova, Loris D'Antoni</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliably generating highly structured outputs, such as program code, mathematical formulas, or well-formed markup. Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedily restricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that the output matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constrained decoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper we demonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decoding techniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that are grammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the ones given by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem of aligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD), and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), a decoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provably producing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM's distribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm uses prior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality of different output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLP tasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (according to the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcing the desired grammatical constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ekta Gujral, Ravdeep Pasricha, Evangelos E. Papalexakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Tensor decompositions are invaluable tools in analyzing multimodal datasets. In many real-world scenarios, such datasets are far from being static, to the contrary they tend to grow over time. For instance, in an online social network setting, as we observe new interactions over time, our dataset gets updated in its "time" mode. How can we maintain a valid and accurate tensor decomposition of such a dynamically evolving multimodal dataset, without having to re-compute the entire decomposition after every single update? In this paper we introduce SaMbaTen, a Sampling-based Batch Incremental Tensor Decomposition algorithm, which incrementally maintains the decomposition given new updates to the tensor dataset. SaMbaTen is able to scale to datasets that the state-of-the-art in incremental tensor decomposition is unable to operate on, due to its ability to effectively summarize the existing tensor and the incoming updates, and perform all computations in the reduced summary space. We extensively evaluate SaMbaTen using synthetic and real datasets. Indicatively, SaMbaTen achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art incremental and non-incremental techniques, while being 25-30 times faster. Furthermore, SaMbaTen scales to very large sparse and dense dynamically evolving tensors of dimensions up to 100K x 100K x 100K where state-of-the-art incremental approaches were not able to operate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Donglin Wang, Jingzehua Xu, Miao Liu, Shuai Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Typically, traditional Imitation Learning (IL) methods first shape a reward or Q function and then use this shaped function within a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize the empirical policy. However, if the shaped reward/Q function does not adequately represent the ground truth reward/Q function, updating the policy within a multi-step RL framework may result in cumulative bias, further impacting policy learning. Although utilizing behavior cloning (BC) to learn a policy by directly mimicking a few demonstrations in a single-step updating manner can avoid cumulative bias, BC tends to greedily imitate demonstrated actions, limiting its capacity to generalize to unseen state action pairs. To address these challenges, we propose ADR-BC, which aims to enhance behavior cloning through augmented density-based action support, optimizing the policy with this augmented support. Specifically, the objective of ADR-BC shares the similar physical meanings that matching expert distribution while diverging the sub-optimal distribution. Therefore, ADR-BC can achieve more robust expert distribution matching. Meanwhile, as a one-step behavior cloning framework, ADR-BC avoids the cumulative bias associated with multi-step RL frameworks. To validate the performance of ADR-BC, we conduct extensive experiments. Specifically, ADR-BC showcases a 10.5% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalized IL baseline, CEIL, across all tasks in the Gym-Mujoco domain. Additionally, it achieves an 89.5% improvement over Implicit Q Learning (IQL) using real rewards across all tasks in the Adroit and Kitchen domains. On the other hand, we conduct extensive ablations to further demonstrate the effectiveness of ADR-BC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying critical research within the growing body of academic work is an essential element of quality research. Systematic review processes, used in evidence-based medicine, formalise this as a procedure that must be followed in a research program. However, it comes with an increasing burden in terms of the time required to identify the important articles of research for a given topic. In this work, we develop a method for building a general-purpose filtering system that matches a research question, posed as a natural language description of the required content, against a candidate set of articles obtained via the application of broad search terms. Our results demonstrate that transformer models, pre-trained on biomedical literature then fine tuned for the specific task, offer a promising solution to this problem. The model can remove large volumes of irrelevant articles for most research questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhammad Zubair Irshad</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a data-centric intelligence i.e. artificially intelligent models unlocking the potential to ingest a large amount of data and be really good at performing digital tasks such as text-to-image generation, machine-human conversation, and image recognition. This thesis covers the topic of learning with structured inductive bias and priors to design approaches and algorithms unlocking the potential of principle-centric intelligence. Prior knowledge (priors for short), often available in terms of past experience as well as assumptions of how the world works, helps the autonomous agent generalize better and adapt their behavior based on past experience. In this thesis, I demonstrate the use of prior knowledge in three different robotics perception problems. 1. object-centric 3D reconstruction, 2. vision and language for decision-making, and 3. 3D scene understanding. To solve these challenging problems, I propose various sources of prior knowledge including 1. geometry and appearance priors from synthetic data, 2. modularity and semantic map priors and 3. semantic, structural, and contextual priors. I study these priors for solving robotics 3D perception tasks and propose ways to efficiently encode them in deep learning models. Some priors are used to warm-start the network for transfer learning, others are used as hard constraints to restrict the action space of robotics agents. While classical techniques are brittle and fail to generalize to unseen scenarios and data-centric approaches require a large amount of labeled data, this thesis aims to build intelligent agents which require very-less real-world data or data acquired only from simulation to generalize to highly dynamic and cluttered environments in novel simulations (i.e. sim2sim) or real-world unseen environments (i.e. sim2real) for a holistic scene understanding of the 3D world.</p>

However, there is currently no standard for evaluating the use of LLMs in astronomy. Therefore, we present the experimental design for an evaluation study on how astronomy researchers interact with LLMs. We deploy a Slack chatbot that can answer queries from users via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); these responses are grounded in astronomy papers from arXiv. We record and anonymize user questions and chatbot answers, user upvotes and downvotes to LLM responses, user feedback to the LLM, and retrieved documents and similarity scores with the query. Our data collection method will enable future dynamic evaluations of LLM tools for astronomy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is a key research topic in seamless communication, which focuses on the preservation of semantics and speaker vocal style in translated speech. Early works synthesized speaker style aligned speech in order to directly learn the mapping from speech to target speech spectrogram. Without reliance on style aligned data, recent studies leverage the advances of language modeling (LM) and build cascaded LMs on semantic and acoustic tokens. This work proposes SeamlessExpressiveLM, a single speech language model for expressive S2ST. We decompose the complex source-to-target speech mapping into intermediate generation steps with chain-of-thought prompting. The model is first guided to translate target semantic content and then transfer the speaker style to multi-stream acoustic units. Evaluated on Spanish-to-English and Hungarian-to-English translations, SeamlessExpressiveLM outperforms cascaded LMs in both semantic quality and style transfer, meanwhile achieving better parameter efficiency.</p>

This crisis is driven by the improper and overuse of antibiotics, which escalates bacterial resistance. In response, this study explores the use of clinical decision support systems, enhanced through the integration of electronic health records (EHRs), to improve antibiotic stewardship. However, EHR systems present numerous data-level challenges, complicating the effective synthesis and utilization of data. In this work, we transform EHR data into a serialized textual representation and employ pretrained foundation models to demonstrate how this enhanced feature representation can aid in antibiotic susceptibility predictions. Our results suggest that this text representation, combined with foundation models, provides a valuable tool to increase interpretability and support antibiotic stewardship efforts.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increased availability of medical data has significantly impacted healthcare by enabling the application of machine / deep learning approaches in various instances. However, medical datasets are usually small and scattered across multiple providers, suffer from high class-imbalance, and are subject to stringent data privacy constraints. In this paper, the application of a data regularization algorithm, suitable for learning under high class-imbalance, in a federated learning setting is proposed. Specifically, the goal of the proposed method is to enhance model performance for cardiovascular disease prediction by tackling the class-imbalance that typically characterizes datasets used for this purpose, as well as by leveraging patient data available in different nodes of a federated ecosystem without compromising their privacy and enabling more resource sensitive allocation. The method is evaluated across four datasets for cardiovascular disease prediction, which are scattered across different clients, achieving improved performance. Meanwhile, its robustness under various hyperparameter settings, as well as its ability to adapt to different resource allocation scenarios, is verified.</p>

<p>Abstract: While humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs), they are susceptible to generating inaccurate or false information, also known as "hallucinations". Technical advancements have been made in algorithms that detect hallucinated content by assessing the factuality of the model's responses and attributing sections of those responses to specific source documents. However, there is limited research on how to effectively communicate this information to users in ways that will help them appropriately calibrate their trust toward LLMs. To address this issue, we conducted a scenario-based study (N=104) to systematically compare the impact of various design strategies for communicating factuality and source attribution on participants' ratings of trust, preferences, and ease in validating response accuracy. Our findings reveal that participants preferred a design in which phrases within a response were color-coded based on the computed factuality scores. Additionally, participants increased their trust ratings when relevant sections of the source material were highlighted or responses were annotated with reference numbers corresponding to those sources, compared to when they received no annotation in the source material. Our study offers practical design guidelines to facilitate human-LLM collaboration and it promotes a new human role to carefully evaluate and take responsibility for their use of LLM outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maya Anderson, Guy Amit, Abigail Goldsteen</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have shown great promise in natural language processing. However, their reliance on data stored in a retrieval database, which may contain proprietary or sensitive information, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, an attacker may be able to infer whether a certain text passage appears in the retrieval database by observing the outputs of the RAG system, an attack known as a Membership Inference Attack (MIA). Despite the significance of this threat, MIAs against RAG systems have yet remained under-explored. This study addresses this gap by introducing an efficient and easy-to-use method for conducting MIA against RAG systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack using two benchmark datasets and multiple generative models, showing that the membership of a document in the retrieval database can be efficiently determined through the creation of an appropriate prompt in both black-box and gray-box settings. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing security countermeasures in deployed RAG systems to protect the privacy and security of retrieval databases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Olshansky, Ramiro Rodriguez Colmeiro, Bowen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: POKT Network's decentralized Remote Procedure Call (RPC) infrastructure, surpassing 740 billion requests since launching on MainNet in 2020, is well-positioned to extend into providing AI inference services with minimal design or implementation modifications. This litepaper illustrates how the network's open-source and permissionless design aligns incentives among model researchers, hardware operators, API providers and users whom we term model Sources, Suppliers, Gateways and Applications respectively. Through its Relay Mining algorithm, POKT creates a transparent marketplace where costs and earnings directly reflect cryptographically verified usage. This decentralized framework offers large model AI researchers a new avenue to disseminate their work and generate revenue without the complexities of maintaining infrastructure or building end-user products. Supply scales naturally with demand, as evidenced in recent years and the protocol's free market dynamics. POKT Gateways facilitate network growth, evolution, adoption, and quality by acting as application-facing load balancers, providing value-added features without managing LLM nodes directly. This vertically decoupled network, battle tested over several years, is set up to accelerate the adoption, operation, innovation and financialization of open-source models. It is the first mature permissionless network whose quality of service competes with centralized entities set up to provide application grade inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing importance of person reidentification in computer vision has highlighted the need for more extensive and diverse datasets. In response, we introduce the ENTIRe-ID dataset, an extensive collection comprising over 4.45 million images from 37 different cameras in varied environments. This dataset is uniquely designed to tackle the challenges of domain variability and model generalization, areas where existing datasets for person re-identification have fallen short. The ENTIRe-ID dataset stands out for its coverage of a wide array of real-world scenarios, encompassing various lighting conditions, angles of view, and diverse human activities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Yujin Han, Diganta Misra, Xiang Li, Kai Hu, Difan Zou, Masashi Sugiyama, Jindong Wang, Bhiksha Raj</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating realistic high-quality images, audios, and videos. They benefit significantly from extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets, including web-crawled data with paired data and conditions, such as image-text and image-class pairs. Despite rigorous filtering, these pre-training datasets often inevitably contain corrupted pairs where conditions do not accurately describe the data. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the impact of such corruption in pre-training data of DMs. We synthetically corrupt ImageNet-1K and CC3M to pre-train and evaluate over 50 conditional DMs. Our empirical findings reveal that various types of slight corruption in pre-training can significantly enhance the quality, diversity, and fidelity of the generated images across different DMs, both during pre-training and downstream adaptation stages. Theoretically, we consider a Gaussian mixture model and prove that slight corruption in the condition leads to higher entropy and a reduced 2-Wasserstein distance to the ground truth of the data distribution generated by the corruptly trained DMs. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a simple method to improve the training of DMs on practical datasets by adding condition embedding perturbations (CEP). CEP significantly improves the performance of various DMs in both pre-training and downstream tasks. We hope that our study provides new insights into understanding the data and pre-training processes of DMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to shop independently, especially in grocery stores, is important for maintaining a high quality of life. This can be particularly challenging for people with visual impairments (PVI). Stores carry thousands of products, with approximately 30,000 new products introduced each year in the US market alone, presenting a challenge even for modern computer vision solutions. Through this work, we present a proof-of-concept socially assistive robotic system we call ShelfHelp, and propose novel technical solutions for enhancing instrumented canes traditionally meant for navigation tasks with additional capability within the domain of shopping. ShelfHelp includes a novel visual product locator algorithm designed for use in grocery stores and a novel planner that autonomously issues verbal manipulation guidance commands to guide the user during product retrieval. Through a human subjects study, we show the system's success in locating and providing effective manipulation guidance to retrieve desired products with novice users. We compare two autonomous verbal guidance modes achieving comparable performance to a human assistance baseline and present encouraging findings that validate our system's efficiency and effectiveness and through positive subjective metrics including competence, intelligence, and ease of use.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning offers promising new ways to accurately model aleatoric uncertainty in robotic estimation systems, particularly when the uncertainty distributions do not conform to traditional assumptions of being fixed and Gaussian. In this study, we formulate and evaluate three fundamental deep learning approaches for conditional probability density modeling to quantify non-Gaussian aleatoric uncertainty: parametric, discretized, and generative modeling. We systematically compare the respective strengths and weaknesses of these three methods on simulated non-Gaussian densities as well as on real-world terrain-relative navigation data. Our results show that these deep learning methods can accurately capture complex uncertainty patterns, highlighting their potential for improving the reliability and robustness of estimation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Ronzano, Jay Nanavati</p>
<p>Abstract: Taking advantage of the widespread use of ontologies to organise and harmonize knowledge across several distinct domains, this paper proposes a novel approach to improve an embedding-Large Language Model (embedding-LLM) of interest by infusing the knowledge formalized by a reference ontology: ontological knowledge infusion aims at boosting the ability of the considered LLM to effectively model the knowledge domain described by the infused ontology. The linguistic information (i.e. concept synonyms and descriptions) and structural information (i.e. is-a relations) formalized by the ontology are utilized to compile a comprehensive set of concept definitions, with the assistance of a powerful generative LLM (i.e. GPT-3.5-turbo). These concept definitions are then employed to fine-tune the target embedding-LLM using a contrastive learning framework. To demonstrate and evaluate the proposed approach, we utilize the biomedical disease ontology MONDO. The results show that embedding-LLMs enhanced by ontological disease knowledge exhibit an improved capability to effectively evaluate the similarity of in-domain sentences from biomedical documents mentioning diseases, without compromising their out-of-domain performance.</p>

However, the use of GNNs (and machine learning more generally) to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems is much less explored. Here, we introduce a novel GNN architecture which leverages a complex filter bank and localized attention mechanisms designed to solve CO problems on graphs. We show how our method differentiates itself from prior GNN-based CO solvers and how it can be effectively applied to the maximum clique, minimum dominating set, and maximum cut problems in a self-supervised learning setting. In addition to demonstrating competitive overall performance across all tasks, we establish state-of-the-art results for the max cut problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: A globally robust deep neural network resists perturbations on all meaningful inputs. Current robustness certification methods emphasize local robustness, struggling to scale and generalize. This paper presents a systematic and efficient method to evaluate and verify global robustness for deep neural networks, leveraging the PAC verification framework for solid guarantees on verification results. We utilize probabilistic programs to characterize meaningful input regions, setting a realistic standard for global robustness. Additionally, we introduce the cumulative robustness curve as a criterion in evaluating global robustness. We design a statistical method that combines multi-level splitting and regression analysis for the estimation, significantly reducing the execution time. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our verification method and its capability to find rare and diversified counterexamples for adversarial training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haroon Miah, Dimitrios Kollias, Giacinto Luca Pedone, Drew Provan, Frederick Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Primary Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disease characterised by immune-mediated destruction of peripheral blood platelets in patients leading to low platelet counts and bleeding. The diagnosis and effective management of ITP is challenging because there is no established test to confirm the disease and no biomarker with which one can predict the response to treatment and outcome. In this work we conduct a feasibility study to check if machine learning can be applied effectively for diagnosis of ITP using routine blood tests and demographic data in a non-acute outpatient setting. Various ML models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Random Forest, were applied to data from the UK Adult ITP Registry and a general hematology clinic. Two different approaches were investigated: a demographic-unaware and a demographic-aware one. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the predictive performance of these models and approaches, as well as their bias. The results revealed that Decision Tree and Random Forest models were both superior and fair, achieving nearly perfect predictive and fairness scores, with platelet count identified as the most significant variable. Models not provided with demographic information performed better in terms of predictive accuracy but showed lower fairness score, illustrating a trade-off between predictive performance and fairness.</p>

<p>Abstract: In psychiatry, negative patient descriptions and stigmatizing language can contribute to healthcare disparities in two ways: (1) read by patients they can harm their trust and engagement with the medical center; (2) read by future providers they may negatively influence the future perspective of a patient. By leveraging large language models, this work aims to identify the sentiment expressed in psychiatric clinical notes based on the reader's point of view. Extracting sentences from the Mount Sinai Health System's large and diverse clinical notes, we used prompts and in-context learning to adapt three large language models (GPT-3.5, Llama 2, Mistral) to classify the sentiment conveyed by the sentences according to the provider or non-provider point of view. Results showed that GPT-3.5 aligns best to provider point of view, whereas Mistral aligns best to non-provider point of view.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yisu Liu, Jinyang An, Wanqian Zhang, Dayan Wu, Jingzi Gu, Zheng Lin, Weiping Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of diffusion-based customization methods like DreamBooth, individuals now have access to train the models that can generate their personalized images. Despite the convenience, malicious users have misused these techniques to create fake images, thereby triggering a privacy security crisis. In light of this, proactive adversarial attacks are proposed to protect users against customization. The adversarial examples are trained to distort the customization model's outputs and thus block the misuse. In this paper, we propose DisDiff (Disrupting Diffusion), a novel adversarial attack method to disrupt the diffusion model outputs. We first delve into the intrinsic image-text relationships, well-known as cross-attention, and empirically find that the subject-identifier token plays an important role in guiding image generation. Thus, we propose the Cross-Attention Erasure module to explicitly "erase" the indicated attention maps and disrupt the text guidance. Besides,we analyze the influence of the sampling process of the diffusion model on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack and introduce a novel Merit Sampling Scheduler to adaptively modulate the perturbation updating amplitude in a step-aware manner. Our DisDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 12.75% of FDFR scores and 7.25% of ISM scores across two facial benchmarks and two commonly used prompts on average.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare and beyond, the integration of generative AI in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) represents a pivotal advancement, addressing a critical gap in current information extraction techniques. This paper introduces GAMedX, a Named Entity Recognition (NER) approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently extract entities from medical narratives and unstructured text generated throughout various phases of the patient hospital visit. By addressing the significant challenge of processing unstructured medical text, GAMedX leverages the capabilities of generative AI and LLMs for improved data extraction. Employing a unified approach, the methodology integrates open-source LLMs for NER, utilizing chained prompts and Pydantic schemas for structured output to navigate the complexities of specialized medical jargon. The findings reveal significant ROUGE F1 score on one of the evaluation datasets with an accuracy of 98\%. This innovation enhances entity extraction, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution for automated forms filling from unstructured data. As a result, GAMedX streamlines the processing of unstructured narratives, and sets a new standard in NER applications, contributing significantly to theoretical and practical advancements beyond the medical technology sphere.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Wang, Zheng Wang, Zhaopeng Peng, Zihui Wang, Cheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) stands to gain significant advantages from collaboratively training capacity-heterogeneous models, enabling the utilization of private data and computing power from low-capacity devices. However, the focus on personalizing capacity-heterogeneous models based on client-specific data has been limited, resulting in suboptimal local model utility, particularly for low-capacity clients. The heterogeneity in both data and device capacity poses two key challenges for model personalization: 1) accurately retaining necessary knowledge embedded within reduced submodels for each client, and 2) effectively sharing knowledge through aggregating size-varying parameters. To this end, we introduce Pa3dFL, a novel framework designed to enhance local model performance by decoupling and selectively sharing knowledge among capacity-heterogeneous models. First, we decompose each layer of the model into general and personal parameters. Then, we maintain uniform sizes for the general parameters across clients and aggregate them through direct averaging. Subsequently, we employ a hyper-network to generate size-varying personal parameters for clients using learnable embeddings. Finally, we facilitate the implicit aggregation of personal parameters by aggregating client embeddings through a self-attention module. We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of Pa3dFL. Our findings indicate that Pa3dFL consistently outperforms baseline methods across various heterogeneity settings. Moreover, Pa3dFL demonstrates competitive communication and computation efficiency compared to baseline approaches, highlighting its practicality and adaptability in adverse system conditions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series data plays a crucial role across various domains, making it valuable for decision-making and predictive modeling. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have shown promise in this regard, yet their performance hinges on data quality and quantity, often constrained by data scarcity and class imbalance, particularly for rare events like solar flares. Data augmentation techniques offer a potential solution to address these challenges, yet their effectiveness on multivariate time series datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method for time series data named Mean Gaussian Noise (MGN). We investigate the performance of MGN compared to eight existing basic data augmentation methods on a multivariate time series dataset for solar flare prediction, SWAN-SF, using a ML algorithm for time series data, TimeSeriesSVC. The results demonstrate the efficacy of MGN and highlight its potential for improving classification performance in scenarios with extremely imbalanced data. Our time complexity analysis shows that MGN also has a competitive computational cost compared to the investigated alternative methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LInK, a novel framework that integrates contrastive learning of performance and design space with optimization techniques for solving complex inverse problems in engineering design with discrete and continuous variables. We focus on the path synthesis problem for planar linkage mechanisms. By leveraging a multi-modal and transformation-invariant contrastive learning framework, LInK learns a joint representation that captures complex physics and design representations of mechanisms, enabling rapid retrieval from a vast dataset of over 10 million mechanisms. This approach improves precision through the warm start of a hierarchical unconstrained nonlinear optimization algorithm, combining the robustness of traditional optimization with the speed and adaptability of modern deep learning methods. Our results on an existing benchmark demonstrate that LInK outperforms existing methods with 28 times less error compared to a state-of-the-art approach while taking 20 times less time on an existing benchmark. Moreover, we introduce a significantly more challenging benchmark, named LINK-ABC, which involves synthesizing linkages that trace the trajectories of English capital alphabets - an inverse design benchmark task that existing methods struggle with due to large non-linearities and tiny feasible space. Our results demonstrate that LInK not only advances the field of mechanism design but also broadens the applicability of contrastive learning and optimization to other areas of engineering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Backpropagation (BP), a foundational algorithm for training artificial neural networks, predominates in contemporary deep learning. Although highly successful, it is often considered biologically implausible. A significant limitation arises from the need for precise symmetry between connections in the backward and forward pathways to backpropagate gradient signals accurately, which is not observed in biological brains. Researchers have proposed several algorithms to alleviate this symmetry constraint, such as feedback alignment and direct feedback alignment. However, their divergence from backpropagation dynamics presents challenges, particularly in deeper networks and convolutional layers. Here we introduce the Product Feedback Alignment (PFA) algorithm. Our findings demonstrate that PFA closely approximates BP and achieves comparable performance in deep convolutional networks while avoiding explicit weight symmetry. Our results offer a novel solution to the longstanding weight symmetry problem, leading to more biologically plausible learning in deep convolutional networks compared to earlier methods.</p>

As we do not engineer DNNs' functions, it is extremely difficult to diagnose their decisions, and multiple lines of studies proposed to explain principles of DNNs/DL operations. Notably, one line of studies suggests that DNNs may learn concepts, the high level features recognizable to humans. Thus, we hypothesized that DNNs develop abstract codes, not necessarily recognizable to humans, which can be used to augment DNNs' decision-making. To address this hypothesis, we combined foundation segmentation models and unsupervised learning to extract internal codes and identify potential use of abstract codes to make DL's decision-making more reliable and safer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Chen, Tian He, Junfeng Fu, Ling Wang, Jingcai Guo, Hong Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised and self-supervised learning are two main training paradigms for skeleton-based human action recognition. However, the former one-hot classification requires labor-intensive predefined action categories annotations, while the latter involves skeleton transformations (e.g., cropping) in the pretext tasks that may impair the skeleton structure. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel skeleton-based training framework (C$^2$VL) based on Cross-modal Contrastive learning that uses the progressive distillation to learn task-agnostic human skeleton action representation from the Vision-Language knowledge prompts. Specifically, we establish the vision-language action concept space through vision-language knowledge prompts generated by pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs), which enrich the fine-grained details that the skeleton action space lacks. Moreover, we propose the intra-modal self-similarity and inter-modal cross-consistency softened targets in the cross-modal contrastive process to progressively control and guide the degree of pulling vision-language knowledge prompts and corresponding skeletons closer. These soft instance discrimination and self-knowledge distillation strategies contribute to the learning of better skeleton-based action representations from the noisy skeleton-vision-language pairs. During the inference phase, our method requires only the skeleton data as the input for action recognition and no longer for vision-language prompts. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets. The code will be available in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhang Zhou, Zijian Feng, Zixiao Zhu, Junlang Qian, Kezhi Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks using the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inherent bias, leading to prompt brittleness, i.e., sensitivity to design settings such as example selection, order, and prompt formatting. Previous studies have addressed LLM bias through external adjustment of model outputs, but the internal mechanisms that lead to such bias remain unexplored. Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that UniBias significantly enhances ICL performance and alleviates prompt brittleness of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyu Huang, Tongfang Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity matching (EM) is a critical task in data integration, aiming to identify records across different datasets that refer to the same real-world entities. Traditional methods often rely on manually engineered features and rule-based systems, which struggle with diverse and unstructured data. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 offers transformative potential for EM, leveraging their advanced semantic understanding and contextual capabilities. This vision paper explores the application of LLMs to EM, discussing their advantages, challenges, and future research directions. Additionally, we review related work on applying weak supervision and unsupervised approaches to EM, highlighting how LLMs can enhance these methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nerea Aranjuelo, Siyu Huang, Ignacio Arganda-Carreras, Luis Unzueta, Oihana Otaegui, Hanspeter Pfister, Donglai Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaze-annotated facial data is crucial for training deep neural networks (DNNs) for gaze estimation. However, obtaining these data is labor-intensive and requires specialized equipment due to the challenge of accurately annotating the gaze direction of a subject. In this work, we present a generative framework to create annotated gaze data by leveraging the benefits of labeled and unlabeled data sources. We propose a Gaze-aware Compositional GAN that learns to generate annotated facial images from a limited labeled dataset. Then we transfer this model to an unlabeled data domain to take advantage of the diversity it provides. Experiments demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in generating within-domain image augmentations in the ETH-XGaze dataset and cross-domain augmentations in the CelebAMask-HQ dataset domain for gaze estimation DNN training. We also show additional applications of our work, which include facial image editing and gaze redirection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanseul Cho, Jaeyoung Cha, Pranjal Awasthi, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Anupam Gupta, Chulhee Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more "relevant" tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kidist Amde Mekonnen, Nicola Dall'Asen, Paolo Rota</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as a powerful class of deep generative models, achieving remarkable performance in image synthesis tasks. However, these models face challenges in terms of widespread adoption due to their reliance on sequential denoising steps during sample generation. This dependence leads to substantial computational requirements, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained or real-time processing systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates denoising phases directly into the model's architecture, thereby reducing the need for resource-intensive computations. Our approach combines diffusion models with generative adversarial networks (GANs) through knowledge distillation, enabling more efficient training and evaluation. By utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model as a teacher model, we train a student model through adversarial learning, employing layerwise transformations for denoising and submodules for predicting the teacher model's output at various points in time. This integration significantly reduces the number of parameters and denoising steps required, leading to improved sampling speed at test time. We validate our method with extensive experiments, demonstrating comparable performance with reduced computational requirements compared to existing approaches. By enabling the deployment of diffusion models on resource-constrained devices, our research mitigates their computational burden and paves the way for wider accessibility and practical use across the research community and end-users.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojin Zhang, Yulin Fei, Yan Kang, Wei Chen, Lixin Fan, Hai Jin, Qiang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Individuals and businesses have been significantly benefited by Large Language Models (LLMs) including PaLM, Gemini and ChatGPT in various ways. For example, LLMs enhance productivity, reduce costs, and enable us to focus on more valuable tasks. Furthermore, LLMs possess the capacity to sift through extensive datasets, uncover underlying patterns, and furnish critical insights that propel the frontiers of technology and science. However, LLMs also pose privacy concerns. Users' interactions with LLMs may expose their sensitive personal or company information. A lack of robust privacy safeguards and legal frameworks could permit the unwarranted intrusion or improper handling of individual data, thereby risking infringements of privacy and the theft of personal identities. To ensure privacy, it is essential to minimize the dependency between shared prompts and private information. Various randomization approaches have been proposed to protect prompts' privacy, but they may incur utility loss compared to unprotected LLMs prompting. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the balance between the risk of privacy leakage and loss of utility when conducting effective protection mechanisms. The current study develops a framework for inferring privacy-protected Large Language Models (LLMs) and lays down a solid theoretical basis for examining the interplay between privacy preservation and utility. The core insight is encapsulated within a theorem that is called as the NFL (abbreviation of the word No-Free-Lunch) Theorem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kidist Amde Mekonnen</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have a large number of trainable parameters often with sizes of hundreds of thousands or more. Training this algorithm requires a large amount of training data and generating a sufficiently large dataset for these algorithms is costly\cite{noguchi2019image}.
  GANs are generative neural networks that use two deep learning networks that are competing with each other. The networks are generator and discriminator networks. The generator tries to generate realistic images which resemble the actual training dataset by approximating the training data distribution and the discriminator is trained to classify images as real or fake(generated)\cite{goodfellow2016nips}. Training these GAN algorithms also requires a large amount of training dataset\cite{noguchi2019image}.
  In this study, the aim is to address the question, "Given an unconditioned pretrained generator network and a pretrained classifier, is it feasible to develop a conditioned generator without relying on any training dataset?"
  The paper begins with a general introduction to the problem. The subsequent sections are structured as follows: Section 2 provides background information on the problem. Section 3 reviews relevant literature on the topic. Section 4 outlines the methodology employed in this study. Section 5 presents the experimental results. Section 6 discusses the findings and proposes potential future research directions. Finally, Section 7 offers concluding remarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sili Huang, Jifeng Hu, Hechang Chen, Lichao Sun, Bo Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning is a promising approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to handle online tasks, which can be achieved by providing task prompts. Recent works demonstrated that in-context RL could emerge with self-improvement in a trial-and-error manner when treating RL tasks as an across-episodic sequential prediction problem. Despite the self-improvement not requiring gradient updates, current works still suffer from high computational costs when the across-episodic sequence increases with task horizons. To this end, we propose an In-context Decision Transformer (IDT) to achieve self-improvement in a high-level trial-and-error manner. Specifically, IDT is inspired by the efficient hierarchical structure of human decision-making and thus reconstructs the sequence to consist of high-level decisions instead of low-level actions that interact with environments. As one high-level decision can guide multi-step low-level actions, IDT naturally avoids excessively long sequences and solves online tasks more efficiently. Experimental results show that IDT achieves state-of-the-art in long-horizon tasks over current in-context RL methods. In particular, the online evaluation time of our IDT is \textbf{36$\times$} times faster than baselines in the D4RL benchmark and \textbf{27$\times$} times faster in the Grid World benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengwei Zhan, Zhen Xu, Qian Tan, Jie Song, Ru Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional instruct-following ability to complete various downstream tasks. Although this impressive ability makes LLMs flexible task solvers, their performance in solving tasks also heavily relies on instructions. In this paper, we reveal that LLMs are over-sensitive to lexical variations in task instructions, even when the variations are imperceptible to humans. By providing models with neighborhood instructions, which are closely situated in the latent representation space and differ by only one semantically similar word, the performance on downstream tasks can be vastly different. Following this property, we propose a black-box Combinatorial Optimization framework for Prompt Lexical Enhancement (COPLE). COPLE performs iterative lexical optimization according to the feedback from a batch of proxy tasks, using a search strategy related to word influence. Experiments show that even widely-used human-crafted prompts for current benchmarks suffer from the lexical sensitivity of models, and COPLE recovers the declined model ability in both instruct-following and solving downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miaomiao Cai, Lei Chen, Yifan Wang, Haoyue Bai, Peijie Sun, Le Wu, Min Zhang, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) typically suffers from the significant challenge of popularity bias due to the uneven distribution of items in real-world datasets. This bias leads to a significant accuracy gap between popular and unpopular items. It not only hinders accurate user preference understanding but also exacerbates the Matthew effect in recommendation systems. To alleviate popularity bias, existing efforts focus on emphasizing unpopular items or separating the correlation between item representations and their popularity. Despite the effectiveness, existing works still face two persistent challenges: (1) how to extract common supervision signals from popular items to improve the unpopular item representations, and (2) how to alleviate the representation separation caused by popularity bias. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of popularity bias and propose Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC) to address two challenges. Specifically, we use the common supervisory signals modeled in popular item representations and propose a novel popularity-aware supervised alignment module to learn unpopular item representations. Additionally, we suggest re-weighting the contrastive learning loss to mitigate the representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and rationale of PAAC in mitigating popularity bias through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufei Wang, Zhihao Li, Lanqing Guo, Wenhan Yang, Alex C. Kot, Bihan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising framework for novel view synthesis, offering fast rendering speeds and high fidelity. However, the large number of Gaussians and their associated attributes require effective compression techniques. Existing methods primarily compress neural Gaussians individually and independently, i.e., coding all the neural Gaussians at the same time, with little design for their interactions and spatial dependence. Inspired by the effectiveness of the context model in image compression, we propose the first autoregressive model at the anchor level for 3DGS compression in this work. We divide anchors into different levels and the anchors that are not coded yet can be predicted based on the already coded ones in all the coarser levels, leading to more accurate modeling and higher coding efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of entropy coding, e.g., to code the coarsest level with no already coded anchors, we propose to introduce a low-dimensional quantized feature as the hyperprior for each anchor, which can be effectively compressed. Our work pioneers the context model in the anchor level for 3DGS representation, yielding an impressive size reduction of over 100 times compared to vanilla 3DGS and 15 times compared to the most recent state-of-the-art work Scaffold-GS, while achieving comparable or even higher rendering quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyun Gan, Shanyu Gan, Taizhi Su, Peng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With heightened awareness of data privacy protection, Federated Learning (FL) has attracted widespread attention as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning method. However, the distributed nature of federated learning also provides opportunities for backdoor attacks, where attackers can guide the model to produce incorrect predictions without affecting the global model training process.
  This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in federated learning, named GANcrop. This approach leverages contrastive learning to deeply explore the disparities between malicious and benign models for attack identification, followed by the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to recover backdoor triggers and implement targeted mitigation strategies. Experimental findings demonstrate that GANcrop effectively safeguards against backdoor attacks, particularly in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining satisfactory model accuracy, showcasing its remarkable defensive efficacy and practical utility.</p>

<p>Abstract: Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Lin, Qibin Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for defense, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</p>

To address the above problems, we introduce a novel black-box membership inference attack method that operates without needing access to the model's internal U-net.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Ma, Weidi Luo, Yu Wang, Xiaogeng Liu, Muhao Chen, Bo Li, Chaowei Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent and widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. To achieve this objective, it requires us to proactively discover the vulnerability of MLLMs by exploring the attack methods. Thus, structure-based jailbreak attacks, where harmful semantic content is embedded within images, have been proposed to mislead the models. However, previous structure-based jailbreak methods mainly focus on transforming the format of malicious queries, such as converting harmful content into images through typography, which lacks sufficient jailbreak effectiveness and generalizability. To address these limitations, we first introduce the concept of "Role-play" into MLLM jailbreak attacks and propose a novel and effective method called Visual Role-play (VRP). Specifically, VRP leverages Large Language Models to generate detailed descriptions of high-risk characters and create corresponding images based on the descriptions. When paired with benign role-play instruction texts, these high-risk character images effectively mislead MLLMs into generating malicious responses by enacting characters with negative attributes. We further extend our VRP method into a universal setup to demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that VRP outperforms the strongest baseline, Query relevant and FigStep, by an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) margin of 14.3% across all models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks when fine-tuned on specific applications, leveraging their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities learned from vast amounts of data. However, these systems are exposed to substantial safety and security risks during the fine-tuning phase. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-enabled Decision-making systems (BALD), systematically exploring how such attacks can be introduced during the fine-tuning phase across various channels. Specifically, we propose three attack mechanisms and corresponding backdoor optimization methods to attack different components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection. Word injection embeds trigger words directly into the query prompt. Scenario manipulation occurs in the physical environment, where a high-level backdoor semantic scenario triggers the attack. Knowledge injection conducts backdoor attacks on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based LLM systems, strategically injecting word triggers into poisoned knowledge while ensuring the information remains factually accurate for stealthiness. We conduct extensive experiments with three popular LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2), using two datasets (HighwayEnv, nuScenes), and demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers and mechanisms. Finally, we critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed approaches, highlight the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in decision-making tasks, and evaluate potential defenses to safeguard LLM-based decision making systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Security concerns related to Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively explored, yet the safety implications for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in medical contexts (MedMLLMs), remain insufficiently studied. This paper delves into the underexplored security vulnerabilities of MedMLLMs, especially when deployed in clinical environments where the accuracy and relevance of question-and-answer interactions are critically tested against complex medical challenges. By combining existing clinical medical data with atypical natural phenomena, we redefine two types of attacks: mismatched malicious attack (2M-attack) and optimized mismatched malicious attack (O2M-attack). Using our own constructed voluminous 3MAD dataset, which covers a wide range of medical image modalities and harmful medical scenarios, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and propose the MCM optimization method, which significantly enhances the attack success rate on MedMLLMs. Evaluations with this dataset and novel attack methods, including white-box attacks on LLaVA-Med and transfer attacks on four other state-of-the-art models, indicate that even MedMLLMs designed with enhanced security features are vulnerable to security breaches. Our work underscores the urgent need for a concerted effort to implement robust security measures and enhance the safety and efficacy of open-source MedMLLMs, particularly given the potential severity of jailbreak attacks and other malicious or clinically significant exploits in medical settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuhan Zuo, Minghao Wang, Tianqing Zhu, Lefeng Zhang, Shui Yu, Wanlei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing need to comply with privacy regulations and respond to user data deletion requests, integrating machine unlearning into IoT-based federated learning has become imperative. Traditional unlearning methods, however, often lack verifiable mechanisms, leading to challenges in establishing trust. This paper delves into the innovative integration of blockchain technology with federated learning to surmount these obstacles. Blockchain fortifies the unlearning process through its inherent qualities of immutability, transparency, and robust security. It facilitates verifiable certification, harmonizes security with privacy, and sustains system efficiency. We introduce a framework that melds blockchain with federated learning, thereby ensuring an immutable record of unlearning requests and actions. This strategy not only bolsters the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model but also adeptly addresses efficiency and security challenges typical in IoT environments. Our key contributions encompass a certification mechanism for the unlearning process, the enhancement of data security and privacy, and the optimization of data management to ensure system responsiveness in IoT scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaxiang Zhang, Yaojia Mu, Guo-Niu Zhu, Zhongxue Gan</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate visual understanding is imperative for advancing autonomous systems and intelligent robots. Despite the powerful capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) in processing complex visual scenes, precisely recognizing obscured or ambiguously presented visual elements remains challenging. To tackle such issues, this paper proposes InsightSee, a multi-agent framework to enhance VLMs' interpretative capabilities in handling complex visual understanding scenarios. The framework comprises a description agent, two reasoning agents, and a decision agent, which are integrated to refine the process of visual information interpretation. The design of these agents and the mechanisms by which they can be enhanced in visual information processing are presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the InsightSee framework not only boosts performance on specific visual tasks but also retains the original models' strength. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in 6 out of 9 benchmark tests, with a substantial advancement in multimodal understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiyin Lu, Yang Li, Qing-Guo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically integrate a pre-trained LLM with another pre-trained vision transformer through a connector, such as an MLP, endowing the LLM with visual capabilities. However, the misalignment between two embedding strategies in MLLMs -- the structural textual embeddings based on an embedding look-up table and the continuous embeddings generated directly by the vision encoder -- makes challenges for a more seamless fusion of visual and textual information. We propose Ovis, a novel MLLM architecture designed to structurally align visual and textual embeddings. Ovis integrates an additional learnable visual embedding table into the visual encoder's process. To capture rich visual semantics, each image patch indexes the visual embedding table multiple times, resulting in a final visual embedding that is a probabilistic combination of the indexed embeddings. This structural approach mirrors the method used for generating textual embeddings. Empirical evaluations on various multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Ovis outperforms open-source MLLMs of similar parameter scales and even surpasses the proprietary model Qwen-VL-Plus overall. These results highlight the potential of Ovis' structured visual representation for advancing MLLM architectural design and promoting more effective multimodal learning. Both the source code and the training dataset of Ovis will be made publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Paglieri, Saurabh Dash, Tim Rockt\"aschel, Jack Parker-Holder</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) enhances the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling faster operation and compatibility with more accessible hardware through reduced memory usage, at the cost of small performance drops. We explore the role of calibration sets in PTQ, specifically their effect on hidden activations in various notable open-source LLMs. Calibration sets are crucial for evaluating activation magnitudes and identifying outliers, which can distort the quantization range and negatively impact performance. Our analysis reveals a marked contrast in quantization effectiveness across models. The older OPT model, which much of the quantization literature is based on, shows significant performance deterioration and high susceptibility to outliers with varying calibration sets. In contrast, newer models like Llama-2 7B, Llama-3 8B, Command-R 35B, and Mistral 7B demonstrate strong robustness, with Mistral 7B showing near-immunity to outliers and stable activations. These findings suggest a shift in PTQ strategies might be needed. As advancements in pre-training methods reduce the relevance of outliers, there is an emerging need to reassess the fundamentals of current quantization literature. The emphasis should pivot towards optimizing inference speed, rather than primarily focusing on outlier preservation, to align with the evolving characteristics of state-of-the-art LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linus Ericsson, Miguel Espinosa, Chenhongyi Yang, Antreas Antoniou, Amos Storkey, Shay B. Cohen, Steven McDonagh, Elliot J. Crowley</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) finds high performing networks for a given task. Yet the results of NAS are fairly prosaic; they did not e.g. create a shift from convolutional structures to transformers. This is not least because the search spaces in NAS often aren't diverse enough to include such transformations a priori. Instead, for NAS to provide greater potential for fundamental design shifts, we need a novel expressive search space design which is built from more fundamental operations. To this end, we introduce einspace, a search space based on a parameterised probabilistic context-free grammar. Our space is versatile, supporting architectures of various sizes and complexities, while also containing diverse network operations which allow it to model convolutions, attention components and more. It contains many existing competitive architectures, and provides flexibility for discovering new ones. Using this search space, we perform experiments to find novel architectures as well as improvements on existing ones on the diverse Unseen NAS datasets. We show that competitive architectures can be obtained by searching from scratch, and we consistently find large improvements when initialising the search with strong baselines. We believe that this work is an important advancement towards a transformative NAS paradigm where search space expressivity and strategic search initialisation play key roles.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image-based advertisements are complex multimodal stimuli that often contain unusual visual elements and figurative language. Previous research on automatic ad understanding has reported impressive zero-shot accuracy of contrastive vision-and-language models (VLMs) on an ad-explanation retrieval task. Here, we examine the original task setup and show that contrastive VLMs can solve it by exploiting grounding heuristics. To control for this confound, we introduce TRADE, a new evaluation test set with adversarial grounded explanations. While these explanations look implausible to humans, we show that they "fool" four different contrastive VLMs. Our findings highlight the need for an improved operationalisation of automatic ad understanding that truly evaluates VLMs' multimodal reasoning abilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Ren, Jingbang Yang, Linxiao Yang, Xinyue Gu, Liang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The newly deployed service -- one kind of change service, could lead to a new type of minority fault. Existing state-of-the-art methods for fault localization rarely consider the imbalanced fault classification in change service. This paper proposes a novel method that utilizes decision rule sets to deal with highly imbalanced data by optimizing the F1 score subject to cardinality constraints. The proposed method greedily generates the rule with maximal marginal gain and uses an efficient minorize-maximization (MM) approach to select rules iteratively, maximizing a non-monotone submodular lower bound. Compared with existing fault localization algorithms, our algorithm can adapt to the imbalanced fault scenario of change service, and provide interpretable fault causes which are easy to understand and verify. Our method can also be deployed in the online training setting, with only about 15% training overhead compared to the current SOTA methods. Empirical studies showcase that our algorithm outperforms existing fault localization algorithms in both accuracy and model interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anne Beyer, Kranti Chalamalasetti, Sherzod Hakimov, Brielen Madureira, Philipp Sadler, David Schlangen</p>
<p>Abstract: It has been established in recent work that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be prompted to "self-play" conversational games that probe certain capabilities (general instruction following, strategic goal orientation, language understanding abilities), where the resulting interactive game play can be automatically scored. In this paper, we take one of the proposed frameworks for setting up such game-play environments, and further test its usefulness as an evaluation instrument, along a number of dimensions: We show that it can easily keep up with new developments while avoiding data contamination, we show that the tests implemented within it are not yet saturated (human performance is substantially higher than that of even the best models), and we show that it lends itself to investigating additional questions, such as the impact of the prompting language on performance. We believe that the approach forms a good basis for making decisions on model choice for building applied interactive systems, and perhaps ultimately setting up a closed-loop development environment of system and simulated evaluator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunho Lee, Youngbae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the strong performance of Transformers, their quadratic computation complexity presents challenges in applying them to vision tasks. Automatic pruning is one of effective methods for reducing computation complexity without heuristic approaches. However, directly applying it to multi-head attention is not straightforward due to channel misalignment. In this paper, we propose an automatic channel pruning method to take into account the multi-head attention mechanism. First, we incorporate channel similarity-based weights into the pruning indicator to preserve more informative channels in each head. Then, we adjust pruning indicator to enforce removal of channels in equal proportions across all heads, preventing the channel misalignment. We also add a reweight module to compensate for information loss resulting from channel removal, and an effective initialization step for pruning indicator based on difference of attention between original structure and each channel. Our proposed method can be used to not only original attention, but also linear attention, which is more efficient as linear complexity with respect to the number of tokens. On ImageNet-1K, applying our pruning method to the FLattenTransformer, which includes both attention mechanisms, shows outperformed accuracy for several MACs compared with previous state-of-the-art efficient models and pruned methods. Code will be available soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pallavi Mitra, Gesina Schwalbe, Nadja Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, high computational and storage demands hinder their deployment into resource-constrained environments, such as embedded devices. Model pruning helps to meet these restrictions by reducing the model size, while maintaining superior performance. Meanwhile, safety-critical applications pose more than just resource and performance constraints. In particular, predictions must not be overly confident, i.e., provide properly calibrated uncertainty estimations (proper uncertainty calibration), and CNNs must be robust against corruptions like naturally occurring input perturbations (natural corruption robustness). This work investigates the important trade-off between uncertainty calibration, natural corruption robustness, and performance for current state-of-research post-hoc CNN pruning techniques in the context of image classification tasks. Our study reveals that post-hoc pruning substantially improves the model's uncertainty calibration, performance, and natural corruption robustness, sparking hope for safe and robust embedded CNNs.Furthermore, uncertainty calibration and natural corruption robustness are not mutually exclusive targets under pruning, as evidenced by the improved safety aspects obtained by post-hoc unstructured pruning with increasing compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxi Liu, Lianghao Xia, Chao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation effectively addresses information overload by modeling users' temporal and sequential interaction patterns. To overcome the limitations of supervision signals, recent approaches have adopted self-supervised learning techniques in recommender systems. However, there are still two critical challenges that remain unsolved. Firstly, existing sequential models primarily focus on long-term modeling of individual interaction sequences, overlooking the valuable short-term collaborative relationships among the behaviors of different users. Secondly, real-world data often contain noise, particularly in users' short-term behaviors, which can arise from temporary intents or misclicks. Such noise negatively impacts the accuracy of both graph and sequence models, further complicating the modeling process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Self-Supervised Graph Neural Network (SelfGNN) for sequential recommendation. The SelfGNN framework encodes short-term graphs based on time intervals and utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn short-term collaborative relationships. It captures long-term user and item representations at multiple granularity levels through interval fusion and dynamic behavior modeling. Importantly, our personalized self-augmented learning structure enhances model robustness by mitigating noise in short-term graphs based on long-term user interests and personal stability. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SelfGNN outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoav Kolumbus, Joe Halpern, \'Eva Tardos</p>
<p>Abstract: In repeated games, such as auctions, players typically use learning algorithms to choose their actions. The use of such autonomous learning agents has become widespread on online platforms. In this paper, we explore the impact of players incorporating monetary transfers into their agents' algorithms, aiming to incentivize behavior in their favor. Our focus is on understanding when players have incentives to make use of monetary transfers, how these payments affect learning dynamics, and what the implications are for welfare and its distribution among the players. We propose a simple game-theoretic model to capture such scenarios. Our results on general games show that in a broad class of games, players benefit from letting their learning agents make payments to other learners during the game dynamics, and that in many cases, this kind of behavior improves welfare for all players. Our results on first- and second-price auctions show that in equilibria of the ``payment policy game,'' the agents' dynamics can reach strong collusive outcomes with low revenue for the auctioneer. These results highlight a challenge for mechanism design in systems where automated learning agents can benefit from interacting with their peers outside the boundaries of the mechanism.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Colelough, Andrew Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Active noise cancellation has been a subject of research for decades. Traditional techniques, like the Fast Fourier Transform, have limitations in certain scenarios. This research explores the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) as a superior alternative. Objective: The study aims to determine the effect sampling rate within training data has on lightweight, efficient DNNs that operate within the processing constraints of mobile devices. Methods: We chose the ConvTasNET network for its proven efficiency in speech separation and enhancement. ConvTasNET was trained on datasets such as WHAM!, LibriMix, and the MS-2023 DNS Challenge. The datasets were sampled at rates of 8kHz, 16kHz, and 48kHz to analyze the effect of sampling rate on noise cancellation efficiency and effectiveness. The model was tested on a core-i7 Intel processor from 2023, assessing the network's ability to produce clear audio while filtering out background noise. Results: Models trained at higher sampling rates (48kHz) provided much better evaluation metrics against Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Quality Prediction For Generative Neural Speech Codecs (WARP-Q) values, indicating improved audio quality. However, a trade-off was noted with the processing time being longer for higher sampling rates. Conclusions: The Conv-TasNET network, trained on datasets sampled at higher rates like 48kHz, offers a robust solution for mobile devices in achieving noise cancellation through speech separation and enhancement. Future work involves optimizing the model's efficiency further and testing on mobile devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Yang, Ruoyu Wang, Yang Tan, Liping Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Online action detection (OAD) aims to identify ongoing actions from streaming video in real-time, without access to future frames. Since these actions manifest at varying scales of granularity, ranging from coarse to fine, projecting an entire set of action frames to a single latent encoding may result in a lack of local information, necessitating the acquisition of action features across multiple scales. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale action learning transformer (MALT), which includes a novel recurrent decoder (used for feature fusion) that includes fewer parameters and can be trained more efficiently. A hierarchical encoder with multiple encoding branches is further proposed to capture multi-scale action features. The output from the preceding branch is then incrementally input to the subsequent branch as part of a cross-attention calculation. In this way, output features transition from coarse to fine as the branches deepen. We also introduce an explicit frame scoring mechanism employing sparse attention, which filters irrelevant frames more efficiently, without requiring an additional network. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets (THUMOS'14 and TVSeries), outperforming all existing models used for comparison, with an mAP of 0.2% for THUMOS'14 and an mcAP of 0.1% for TVseries.</p>

Experiments reveal that preemptive answers significantly impair the model's reasoning capability across various CoT methods and a broad spectrum of datasets. To bolster the robustness of reasoning, we propose two measures aimed at mitigating this issue to some extent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ptychography is a powerful imaging technique that is used in a variety of fields, including materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, the accuracy of the reconstructed ptychography image is highly dependent on the accuracy of the recorded probe positions which often contain errors. These errors are typically corrected jointly with phase retrieval through numerical optimization approaches. When the error accumulates along the scan path or when the error magnitude is large, these approaches may not converge with satisfactory result. We propose a fundamentally new approach for ptychography probe position prediction for data with large position errors, where a neural network is used to make single-shot phase retrieval on individual diffraction patterns, yielding the object image at each scan point. The pairwise offsets among these images are then found using a robust image registration method, and the results are combined to yield the complete scan path by constructing and solving a linear equation. We show that our method can achieve good position prediction accuracy for data with large and accumulating errors on the order of $10^2$ pixels, a magnitude that often makes optimization-based algorithms fail to converge. For ptychography instruments without sophisticated position control equipment such as interferometers, our method is of significant practical potential.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling machine learning models significantly improves their performance. However, such gains come at the cost of inference being slow and resource-intensive. Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) offer a promising solution: they accelerate inference by allowing intermediate layers to exit and produce a prediction early. Yet a fundamental issue with EENNs is how to determine when to exit without severely degrading performance. In other words, when is it 'safe' for an EENN to go 'fast'? To address this issue, we investigate how to adapt frameworks of risk control to EENNs. Risk control offers a distribution-free, post-hoc solution that tunes the EENN's exiting mechanism so that exits only occur when the output is of sufficient quality. We empirically validate our insights on a range of vision and language tasks, demonstrating that risk control can produce substantial computational savings, all the while preserving user-specified performance goals.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing size of deep neural networks necessitates effective model compression to improve computational efficiency and reduce their memory footprint. Sparsity and quantization are two prominent compression methods that have individually demonstrated significant reduction in computational and memory footprints while preserving model accuracy. While effective, the interplay between these two methods remains an open question. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between these two methods and assess whether their combination impacts final model accuracy. We mathematically prove that applying sparsity before quantization is the optimal sequence for these operations, minimizing error in computation. Our empirical studies across a wide range of models, including OPT and Llama model families (125M-8B) and ViT corroborate these theoretical findings. In addition, through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate that sparsity and quantization are not orthogonal; their interaction can significantly harm model accuracy, with quantization error playing a dominant role in this degradation. Our findings extend to the efficient deployment of large models in resource-limited compute platforms and reduce serving cost, offering insights into best practices for applying these compression methods to maximize efficacy without compromising accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin Cui, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ion Stoica, Cho-Jui Hsieh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require careful safety alignment to prevent malicious outputs. While significant research focuses on mitigating harmful content generation, the enhanced safety often come with the side effect of over-refusal, where the LLMs may reject innocuous prompts and become less helpful. Although the issue of over-refusal has been empirically observed, a systematic measurement is challenging due to the difficulty of crafting prompts that appear harmful but are benign. This study proposes a novel method for automatically generating large-scale sets of ``seemingly toxic prompts'' (benign prompts likely rejected by LLMs). Leveraging this technique, we introduce OR-Bench, the first large-scale over-refusal benchmark. OR-Bench comprises 80,000 seemingly toxic prompts across 10 common rejection categories, a subset of around 1,000 hard prompts that are challenging even for state-of-the-art LLMs, and an additional 600 toxic prompts to prevent indiscriminate responses. We then conduct a comprehensive study to measure the over-refusal of 25 popular LLMs across 8 model families.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ciro Beneduce, Bruno Lepri, Massimiliano Luca</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting the locations an individual will visit in the future is crucial for solving many societal issues like disease diffusion and reduction of pollution among many others. The models designed to tackle next-location prediction, however, require a significant amount of individual-level information to be trained effectively. Such data may be scarce or even unavailable in some geographic regions or peculiar scenarios (e.g., cold-start in recommendation systems). Moreover, the design of a next-location predictor able to generalize or geographically transfer knowledge is still an open research challenge. Recent advances in natural language processing have led to a rapid diffusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) which have shown good generalization and reasoning capabilities. These insights, coupled with the recent findings that LLMs are rich in geographical knowledge, allowed us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. This paper evaluates the capabilities of many popular LLMs in this role, specifically Llama, GPT-3.5 and Mistral 7B. After designing a proper prompt, we tested the models on three real-world mobility datasets. The results show that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 32.4%, a significant relative improvement of over 600% when compared to sophisticated DL models specifically designed for human mobility. Moreover, we show that other LLMs are unable to perform the task properly. To prevent positively biased results, we also propose a framework inspired by other studies to test data contamination. Finally, we explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for next-location prediction showing that can effectively provide an explanation for their decision. Notably, 7B models provide more generic, but still reliable, explanations compared to larger counterparts. Code: github.com/ssai-trento/LLM-zero-shot-NL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyang Xu, Shujin Wu, Shizhe Diao, Xiaoze Liu, Xingyao Wang, Yangyi Chen, Jing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate or fabricated information and generally fail to indicate their confidence, which limits their broader applications. Previous work elicits confidence from LLMs by direct or self-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised finetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the training-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level confidence estimates. In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a training framework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidence estimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the process of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly identify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This is achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in specific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the analysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the resulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize reinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate the confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence predictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental results in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and maintaining the task performance. We show that the generated self-reflective rationales are reasonable and can further contribute to the calibration. The code is made public at \url{https://github.com/xu1868/SaySelf}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Jinyuan Jia, Bo Li, Radha Poovendran</p>
<p>Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), a set of clients collaboratively train a machine learning model (called global model) without sharing their local training data. The local training data of clients is typically non-i.i.d. and heterogeneous, resulting in varying contributions from individual clients to the final performance of the global model. In response, many contribution evaluation methods were proposed, where the server could evaluate the contribution made by each client and incentivize the high-contributing clients to sustain their long-term participation in FL. Existing studies mainly focus on developing new metrics or algorithms to better measure the contribution of each client. However, the security of contribution evaluation methods of FL operating in adversarial environments is largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first model poisoning attack on contribution evaluation methods in FL, termed ACE. Specifically, we show that any malicious client utilizing ACE could manipulate the parameters of its local model such that it is evaluated to have a high contribution by the server, even when its local training data is indeed of low quality. We perform both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations of ACE. Theoretically, we show our design of ACE can effectively boost the malicious client's perceived contribution when the server employs the widely-used cosine distance metric to measure contribution. Empirically, our results show ACE effectively and efficiently deceive five state-of-the-art contribution evaluation methods. In addition, ACE preserves the accuracy of the final global models on testing inputs. We also explore six countermeasures to defend ACE. Our results show they are inadequate to thwart ACE, highlighting the urgent need for new defenses to safeguard the contribution evaluation methods in FL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleanor Clifford, Adhithya Saravanan, Harry Langford, Cheng Zhang, Yiren Zhao, Robert Mullins, Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Machine Learning models are expensive IP and business competitiveness often depends on keeping this IP confidential. This in turn restricts how these models are deployed -- for example it is unclear how to deploy a model on-device without inevitably leaking the underlying model. At the same time, confidential computing technologies such as Multi-Party Computation or Homomorphic encryption remain impractical for wide adoption. In this paper we take a different approach and investigate feasibility of ML-specific mechanisms that deter unauthorized model use by restricting the model to only be usable on specific hardware, making adoption on unauthorized hardware inconvenient. That way, even if IP is compromised, it cannot be trivially used without specialised hardware or major model adjustment. In a sense, we seek to enable cheap locking of machine learning models into specific hardware. We demonstrate that locking mechanisms are feasible by either targeting efficiency of model representations, such making models incompatible with quantisation, or tie the model's operation on specific characteristics of hardware, such as number of cycles for arithmetic operations. We demonstrate that locking comes with negligible work and latency overheads, while significantly restricting usability of the resultant model on unauthorized hardware.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amr Alkhatib, Henrik Bostr\"om, Michalis Vazirgiannis</p>
<p>Abstract: Characteristic rules have been advocated for their ability to improve interpretability over discriminative rules within the area of rule learning. However, the former type of rule has not yet been used by techniques for explaining predictions. A novel explanation technique, called CEGA (Characteristic Explanatory General Association rules), is proposed, which employs association rule mining to aggregate multiple explanations generated by any standard local explanation technique into a set of characteristic rules. An empirical investigation is presented, in which CEGA is compared to two state-of-the-art methods, Anchors and GLocalX, for producing local and aggregated explanations in the form of discriminative rules. The results suggest that the proposed approach provides a better trade-off between fidelity and complexity compared to the two state-of-the-art approaches; CEGA and Anchors significantly outperform GLocalX with respect to fidelity, while CEGA and GLocalX significantly outperform Anchors with respect to the number of generated rules. The effect of changing the format of the explanations of CEGA to discriminative rules and using LIME and SHAP as local explanation techniques instead of Anchors are also investigated. The results show that the characteristic explanatory rules still compete favorably with rules in the standard discriminative format. The results also indicate that using CEGA in combination with either SHAP or Anchors consistently leads to a higher fidelity compared to using LIME as the local explanation technique.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbo Chen, Haoruo Zhao, Mathieu Tanneau, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in optimization proxies, i.e., machine learning models that approximate the input-output mapping of parametric optimization problems and return near-optimal feasible solutions. Following recent work by (Nellikkath & Chatzivasileiadis, 2021), this paper reconsiders the optimality verification problem for optimization proxies, i.e., the determination of the worst-case optimality gap over the instance distribution. The paper proposes a compact formulation for optimality verification and a gradient-based primal heuristic that brings substantial computational benefits to the original formulation. The compact formulation is also more general and applies to non-convex optimization problems. The benefits of the compact formulation are demonstrated on large-scale DC Optimal Power Flow and knapsack problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiesong Lian, Yucong Huang, Mingzhi Wang, Chengdong Ma, Yixue Hao, Ying Wen, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: For solving zero-sum games involving non-transitivity, a common approach is to maintain population policies to approximate the Nash Equilibrium (NE). Previous research has shown that the Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) is an effective multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for these games. However, repeatedly training new policies from scratch to approximate the Best Response (BR) to opponents' mixed policies at each iteration is inefficient and costly. While some PSRO methods initialize a new BR policy by inheriting from past BR policies, this approach limits the exploration of new policies, especially against challenging opponents.To address this issue, we propose Fusion-PSRO, which uses model fusion to initialize the policy for better approximation to BR. With Top-k probabilities from NE, we select high-quality base policies and fuse them into a new BR policy through model averaging. This approach allows the initialized policy to incorporate multiple expert policies, making it easier to handle difficult opponents compared to inheriting or initializing from scratch. Additionally, our method only modifies the policy initialization, enabling its application to nearly all PSRO variants without additional training overhead.Our experiments with non-transitive matrix games, Leduc poker, and the more complex Liars Dice demonstrate that Fusion-PSRO enhances the performance of nearly all PSRO variants, achieving lower exploitability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Stengel-Eskin, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: When answering questions, LLMs can convey not only an answer, but a level of confidence about the answer being correct. This includes explicit confidence markers (e.g. giving a numeric score) as well as implicit markers, like an authoritative tone or elaborating with additional knowledge. For LLMs to be trustworthy knowledge sources, the confidence they convey should match their actual expertise; however, most current models tend towards overconfidence. To calibrate both implicit and explicit confidence markers, we introduce a pragmatic, listener-aware finetuning method (LACIE) that models the listener, considering not only whether an answer is right, but whether it will be accepted by a listener. We cast calibration as preference optimization, creating data via a two-agent game, where a speaker model's outputs are judged by a simulated listener. We then finetune three LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, Llama3-70B) with LACIE, and show that the resulting models are better calibrated w.r.t. a simulated listener. Crucially, these trends transfer to human listeners, helping them correctly predict model correctness: we conduct a human evaluation where annotators accept or reject an LLM's answers, finding that training with LACIE results in 47% fewer incorrect answers being accepted while maintaining the same level of acceptance for correct answers. Furthermore, LACIE generalizes to another dataset, resulting in a large increase in truthfulness on TruthfulQA when trained on TriviaQA. Our analysis indicates that LACIE leads to a better confidence separation between correct and incorrect examples. Qualitatively, we find that a LACIE-trained model hedges more and implicitly signals certainty when it is correct by using an authoritative tone or including details. Finally, LACIE finetuning leads to an emergent increase in model abstention (e.g. saying "I don't know") for answers that are likely wrong.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runsheng Yu, Yong Wang, Xiaoqi Jiao, Youzhi Zhang, James T. Kwok</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been commonly used to align the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Recently, a popular alternative is Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which replaces an LLM-based reward model with the policy itself, thus obviating the need for extra memory and training time to learn the reward model. However, DPO does not consider the relative qualities of the positive and negative responses, and can lead to sub-optimal training outcomes. To alleviate this problem, we investigate the use of intrinsic knowledge within the on-the-fly fine-tuning LLM to obtain relative qualities and help to refine the loss function. Specifically, we leverage the knowledge of the LLM to design a refinement function to estimate the quality of both the positive and negative responses. We show that the constructed refinement function can help self-refine the loss function under mild assumptions. The refinement function is integrated into DPO and its variant Identity Policy Optimization (IPO). Experiments across various evaluators indicate that they can improve the performance of the fine-tuned models over DPO and IPO.</p>

<p>Abstract: We prove that the combination of a target network and over-parameterized linear function approximation establishes a weaker convergence condition for bootstrapped value estimation in certain cases, even with off-policy data. Our condition is naturally satisfied for expected updates over the entire state-action space or learning with a batch of complete trajectories from episodic Markov decision processes. Notably, using only a target network or an over-parameterized model does not provide such a convergence guarantee. Additionally, we extend our results to learning with truncated trajectories, showing that convergence is achievable for all tasks with minor modifications, akin to value truncation for the final states in trajectories. Our primary result focuses on temporal difference estimation for prediction, providing high-probability value estimation error bounds and empirical analysis on Baird's counterexample and a Four-room task. Furthermore, we explore the control setting, demonstrating that similar convergence conditions apply to Q-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tengyang Xie, Dylan J. Foster, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Corby Rosset, Ahmed Awadallah, Alexander Rakhlin</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a central tool for language model alignment. We consider online exploration in RLHF, which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. By allowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, online exploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-human capabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model training has yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks in directly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a new algorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys the strongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPO augments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus, empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial model and human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provably sample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy under natural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model has good coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPO implicitly performs a form of $Q^{\star}$-approximation (or, Bellman error minimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modeling and theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through the perspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we find that XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in a preliminary evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Branch-and-bound (BaB) is among the most effective methods for neural network (NN) verification. However, existing works on BaB have mostly focused on NNs with piecewise linear activations, especially ReLU networks. In this paper, we develop a general framework, named GenBaB, to conduct BaB for general nonlinearities in general computational graphs based on linear bound propagation. To decide which neuron to branch, we design a new branching heuristic which leverages linear bounds as shortcuts to efficiently estimate the potential improvement after branching. To decide nontrivial branching points for general nonlinear functions, we propose to optimize branching points offline, which can be efficiently leveraged during verification with a lookup table. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GenBaB on verifying a wide range of NNs, including networks with activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, Sine and GeLU, as well as networks involving multi-dimensional nonlinear operations such as multiplications in LSTMs and Vision Transformers. Our framework also allows the verification of general nonlinear computation graphs and enables verification applications beyond simple neural networks, particularly for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). GenBaB is part of the latest $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, the winner of the 4th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP 2023).</p>

<p>Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) notoriously struggle to learn long-term memories, primarily due to vanishing and exploding gradients. The recent success of state-space models (SSMs), a subclass of RNNs, to overcome such difficulties challenges our theoretical understanding. In this paper, we delve into the optimization challenges of RNNs and discover that, as the memory of a network increases, changes in its parameters result in increasingly large output variations, making gradient-based learning highly sensitive, even without exploding gradients. Our analysis further reveals the importance of the element-wise recurrence design pattern combined with careful parametrizations in mitigating this effect. This feature is present in SSMs, as well as in other architectures, such as LSTMs. Overall, our insights provide a new explanation for some of the difficulties in gradient-based learning of RNNs and why some architectures perform better than others.</p>

In this work, we systematically test this claim by comparing pairs of language models on their entity tracking performance. Critically, the pairs consist of base models and models trained on top of these base models with additional code data. We extend this analysis to additionally examine the effect of math training, another highly structured data type, and alignment tuning, an important step for enhancing the usability of models. We find clear evidence that models additionally trained on large amounts of code outperform the base models. On the other hand, we find no consistent benefit of additional math training or alignment tuning across various model families.</p>

<p>Abstract: For static lifted inference algorithms, completeness, i.e., domain liftability, is extensively studied. However, so far no domain liftability results for temporal lifted inference algorithms exist. In this paper, we close this gap. More precisely, we contribute the first completeness and complexity analysis for a temporal lifted algorithm, the socalled lifted dynamic junction tree algorithm (LDJT), which is the only exact lifted temporal inference algorithm out there. To handle temporal aspects efficiently, LDJT uses conditional independences to proceed in time, leading to restrictions w.r.t. elimination orders. We show that these restrictions influence the domain liftability results and show that one particular case while proceeding in time, has to be excluded from FO12 . Additionally, for the complexity of LDJT, we prove that the lifted width is in even more cases smaller than the corresponding treewidth in comparison to static inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large knowledge graphs combine human knowledge garnered from projects ranging from academia and institutions to enterprises and crowdsourcing. Within such graphs, each relationship between two nodes represents a basic fact involving these two entities. The diversity of the semantics of relationships constitutes the richness of knowledge graphs, leading to the emergence of singular topologies, sometimes chaotic in appearance. However, this complex characteristic can be modeled in a simple way by introducing the concept of superficiality, which controls the overlap between relationships whose facts are generated independently. With this model, superficiality also regulates the balance of the global distribution of knowledge by determining the proportion of misdescribed entities. This is the first model for the structure and dynamics of knowledge graphs. It leads to a better understanding of formal knowledge acquisition and organization.</p>

<p>Abstract: DreamCoder is an inductive program synthesis system that, whilst solving problems, learns to simplify search in an iterative wake-sleep procedure. The cost of search is amortized by training a neural search policy, reducing search breadth and effectively "compiling" useful information to compose program solutions across tasks. Additionally, a library of program components is learnt to compress and express discovered solutions in fewer components, reducing search depth. We present a novel approach for library learning that directly leverages the neural search policy, effectively "decompiling" its amortized knowledge to extract relevant program components. This provides stronger amortized inference: the amortized knowledge learnt to reduce search breadth is now also used to reduce search depth. We integrate our approach with DreamCoder and demonstrate faster domain proficiency with improved generalization on a range of domains, particularly when fewer example solutions are available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajie Yu, Pierre-Antoine Laharotte, Yu Han, Wei Ma, Ludovic Leclercq</p>
<p>Abstract: Perimeter Control (PC) strategies have been proposed to address urban road network control in oversaturated situations by regulating the transfer flow of the Protected Network (PN) based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). The uniform metering rate for cordon signals in most existing studies overlooks the variance of local traffic states at the intersection level, which may cause severe local traffic congestion and degradation of the network stability. PC strategies with heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals allow precise control for the perimeter but the complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the scale of the PN. This paper leverages a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based traffic signal control framework to decompose this PC problem, which considers heterogeneous metering rates for cordon signals, into multi-agent cooperation tasks. Each agent controls an individual signal located in the cordon, decreasing the dimension of action space for the controller compared to centralized methods. A physics regularization approach for the MARL framework is proposed to ensure the distributed cordon signal controllers are aware of the global network state by encoding MFD-based knowledge into the action-value functions of the local agents. The proposed PC strategy is operated as a two-stage system, with a feedback PC strategy detecting the overall traffic state within the PN and then distributing local instructions to cordon signals controllers in the MARL framework via the physics regularization. Through numerical tests with different demand patterns in a microscopic traffic environment, the proposed PC strategy shows promising robustness and transferability. It outperforms state-of-the-art feedback PC strategies in increasing network throughput, decreasing distributed delay for gate links, and reducing carbon emissions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seth Neel, Peter Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: This is the first survey of the active area of AI research that focuses on privacy issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we focus on work that red-teams models to highlight privacy risks, attempts to build privacy into the training or inference process, enables efficient data deletion from trained models to comply with existing privacy regulations, and tries to mitigate copyright issues. Our focus is on summarizing technical research that develops algorithms, proves theorems, and runs empirical evaluations. While there is an extensive body of legal and policy work addressing these challenges from a different angle, that is not the focus of our survey. Nevertheless, these works, along with recent legal developments do inform how these technical problems are formalized, and so we discuss them briefly in Section 1. While we have made our best effort to include all the relevant work, due to the fast moving nature of this research we may have missed some recent work. If we have missed some of your work please contact us, as we will attempt to keep this survey relatively up to date. We are maintaining a repository with the list of papers covered in this survey and any relevant code that was publicly available at https://github.com/safr-ml-lab/survey-llm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyue Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: When we design and deploy an Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, reward functions motivates agents to achieve an objective. An incorrect or incomplete specification of the objective can result in behavior that does not align with human values - failing to adhere with social and moral norms that are ambiguous and context dependent, and cause undesired outcomes such as negative side effects and exploration that is unsafe. Previous work have manually defined reward functions to avoid negative side effects, use human oversight for safe exploration, or use foundation models as planning tools. This work studies the ability of leveraging Large Language Models (LLM)' understanding of morality and social norms on safe exploration augmented RL methods. This work evaluates language model's result against human feedbacks and demonstrates language model's capability as direct reward signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Germ\'an Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of tools based on artificial intelligence has also led to the need of producing explanations which are understandable by a human being. In most approaches, the system is considered a black box, making it difficult to generate appropriate explanations. In this work, though, we consider a setting where models are transparent: probabilistic logic programming (PLP), a paradigm that combines logic programming for knowledge representation and probability to model uncertainty. However, given a query, the usual notion of explanation is associated with a set of choices, one for each random variable of the model. Unfortunately, such a set does not explain why the query is true and, in fact, it may contain choices that are actually irrelevant for the considered query. To improve this situation, we present in this paper an approach to explaining explanations which is based on defining a new query-driven inference mechanism for PLP where proofs are labeled with "choice expressions", a compact and easy to manipulate representation for sets of choices. The combination of proof trees and choice expressions allows us to produce comprehensible query justifications with a causal structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Altmeyer, Andrew M. Demetriou, Antony Bartlett, Cynthia C. S. Liem</p>
<p>Abstract: Developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and particularly large language models (LLMs), have created a 'perfect storm' for observing 'sparks' of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that are spurious. Like simpler models, LLMs distill meaningful representations in their latent embeddings that have been shown to correlate with external variables. Nonetheless, the correlation of such representations has often been linked to human-like intelligence in the latter but not the former. We probe models of varying complexity including random projections, matrix decompositions, deep autoencoders and transformers: all of them successfully distill information that can be used to predict latent or external variables and yet none of them have previously been linked to AGI. We argue and empirically demonstrate that the finding of meaningful patterns in latent spaces of models cannot be seen as evidence in favor of AGI. Additionally, we review literature from the social sciences that shows that humans are prone to seek such patterns and anthropomorphize. We conclude that both the methodological setup and common public image of AI are ideal for the misinterpretation that correlations between model representations and some variables of interest are 'caused' by the model's understanding of underlying 'ground truth' relationships. We, therefore, call for the academic community to exercise extra caution, and to be keenly aware of principles of academic integrity, in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Sun, Xianyin Zhang, Shiyu Huang, Shaowei Cai, BingZhen Zhang, Ke Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Heuristics are crucial in SAT solvers, but no heuristic rules are suitable for all SAT problems. Therefore, it is helpful to refine specific heuristics for specific problems. In this context, we present AutoSAT, a novel framework for automatically optimizing heuristics in SAT solvers. AutoSAT is based on Large Language Models (LLMs) which is able to autonomously generate codes, conduct evaluation, and then utilize feedback to further optimize heuristics, thereby reducing human intervention and enhancing solver capabilities. AutoSAT operates on a plug-and-play basis, eliminating the need for extensive enterprise and model training, and fosters a Multi-Agent-based collaborative process with fault tolerance to ensure robust heuristic optimization. We implement AutoSAT on a lightweight Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solver EasySAT (the volume of EasySAT is about one-fiftieth of the State-of-the-Art hybrid solver Kissat) and extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate its superior performance. Out of the seven testing datasets, AutoSAT shows a superior performance to Kissat in two datasets and displays an overall similar performance in three datasets. Some heuristics generated by AutoSAT are even counter-intuitive but are very effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixing Lei, Zhenyang Ni, Ruize Han, Shuo Tang, Dingju Wang, Chen Feng, Siheng Chen, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: A consistent spatial-temporal coordination across multiple agents is fundamental for collaborative perception, which seeks to improve perception abilities through information exchange among agents. To achieve this spatial-temporal alignment, traditional methods depend on external devices to provide localization and clock signals. However, hardware-generated signals could be vulnerable to noise and potentially malicious attack, jeopardizing the precision of spatial-temporal alignment. Rather than relying on external hardwares, this work proposes a novel approach: aligning by recognizing the inherent geometric patterns within the perceptual data of various agents. Following this spirit, we propose a robust collaborative perception system that operates independently of external localization and clock devices. The key module of our system,~\emph{FreeAlign}, constructs a salient object graph for each agent based on its detected boxes and uses a graph neural network to identify common subgraphs between agents, leading to accurate relative pose and time. We validate \emph{FreeAlign} on both real-world and simulated datasets. The results show that, the ~\emph{FreeAlign} empowered robust collaborative perception system perform comparably to systems relying on precise localization and clock devices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiling Li, Hongrun Ren, Haixu Xiong, Zhenxing Qian, Xinpeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generation models have shown promising performance in various tasks, making trading around machine learning models possible. In this paper, we aim at a novel prompt trading scenario, prompt bundle trading (PBT) system, and propose an online pricing mechanism. Based on the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) and three-stage hierarchical Stackelburg (HS) game, our pricing mechanism considers the profits of the consumer, platform, and seller, simultaneously achieving the profit satisfaction of these three participants. We break down the pricing issue into two steps, namely unknown category selection and incentive strategy optimization. The former step is to select a set of categories with the highest qualities, and the latter is to derive the optimal strategy for each participant based on the chosen categories. Unlike the existing fixed pricing mode, the PBT pricing mechanism we propose is more flexible and diverse, which is more in accord with the transaction needs of real-world scenarios. We test our method on a simulated text-to-image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, which provides a feasible price-setting standard for the prompt marketplaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Winnie Street, John Oliver Siy, Geoff Keeling, Adrien Baranes, Benjamin Barnett, Michael McKibben, Tatenda Kanyere, Alison Lentz, Blaise Aguera y Arcas, Robin I. M. Dunbar</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have developed higher-order theory of mind (ToM); the human ability to reason about multiple mental and emotional states in a recursive manner (e.g. I think that you believe that she knows). This paper builds on prior work by introducing a handwritten test suite -- Multi-Order Theory of Mind Q&A -- and using it to compare the performance of five LLMs to a newly gathered adult human benchmark. We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for the realisation of ToM abilities, and that the best-performing LLMs have developed a generalised capacity for ToM. Given the role that higher-order ToM plays in a wide range of cooperative and competitive human behaviours, these findings have significant implications for user-facing LLM applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Zhang, Weirong Cui, Jingjing Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Monitoring sleep states is essential for evaluating sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Traditional manual staging is time-consuming and prone to subjective bias, often resulting in inconsistent outcomes. Here, we developed an automated model for sleep staging and disorder classification to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Considering the characteristics of polysomnography (PSG) multi-lead sleep monitoring, we designed a multimodal sleep state classification model, MSSC-BiMamba, that combines an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism with a Bidirectional State Space Model (BSSM). The ECA module allows for weighting data from different sensor channels, thereby amplifying the influence of diverse sensor inputs. Additionally, the implementation of bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) enables the model to effectively capture the multidimensional features and long-range dependencies of PSG data. The developed model demonstrated impressive performance on sleep stage classification tasks on both the ISRUC-S3 and ISRUC-S1 datasets, respectively containing data with healthy and unhealthy sleep patterns. Also, the model exhibited a high accuracy for sleep health prediction when evaluated on a combined dataset consisting of ISRUC and Sleep-EDF. Our model, which can effectively handle diverse sleep conditions, is the first to apply BiMamba to sleep staging with multimodal PSG data, showing substantial gains in computational and memory efficiency over traditional Transformer-style models. This method enhances sleep health management by making monitoring more accessible and extending advanced healthcare through innovative technology.</p>

We adopt a modular, layered design: at the library's lowest level of abstraction, we provide building blocks for creating models and data preprocessing pipelines, and at the library's highest level of abstraction, we provide pretrained ``task" models for popular architectures such as Stable Diffusion, YOLOv8, GPT2, BERT, Mistral, CLIP, Gemma, T5, etc. Task models have built-in preprocessing, pretrained weights, and can be fine-tuned on raw inputs. To enable efficient training, we support XLA compilation for all models, and run all preprocessing via a compiled graph of TensorFlow operations using the tf.data API.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Zhao, Jia-Wei Shan, Yu-Jie Zhang, Zhi-Hua Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In conventional supervised learning, a training dataset is given with ground-truth labels from a known label set, and the learned model will classify unseen instances to known labels. This paper studies a new problem setting in which there are unknown classes in the training data misperceived as other labels, and thus their existence appears unknown from the given supervision. We attribute the unknown unknowns to the fact that the training dataset is badly advised by the incompletely perceived label space due to the insufficient feature information. To this end, we propose the exploratory machine learning, which examines and investigates training data by actively augmenting the feature space to discover potentially hidden classes. Our method consists of three ingredients including rejection model, feature exploration, and model cascade. We provide theoretical analysis to justify its superiority, and validate the effectiveness on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangwei Zhao, Zejia Liu, Xiaohan Guo, Lili Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentanglement, a critical concern in interpretable machine learning, has also garnered significant attention from the computer vision community. Many existing GAN-based class disentanglement (unsupervised) approaches, such as InfoGAN and its variants, primarily aim to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the generated image and its latent codes. However, this focus may lead to a tendency for the network to generate highly similar images when presented with the same latent class factor, potentially resulting in mode collapse or mode dropping. To alleviate this problem, we propose \texttt{CoDeGAN} (Contrastive Disentanglement for Generative Adversarial Networks), where we relax similarity constraints for disentanglement from the image domain to the feature domain. This modification not only enhances the stability of GAN training but also improves their disentangling capabilities. Moreover, we integrate self-supervised pre-training into CoDeGAN to learn semantic representations, significantly facilitating unsupervised disentanglement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is a widely used ensemble algorithm in the industry. Its vertical federated learning version, SecureBoost, is one of the most popular algorithms used in cross-silo privacy-preserving modeling. As the area of privacy computation thrives in recent years, demands for large-scale and high-performance federated learning have grown dramatically in real-world applications. In this paper, to fulfill these requirements, we propose SecureBoost+ that is both novel and improved from the prior work SecureBoost. SecureBoost+ integrates several ciphertext calculation optimizations and engineering optimizations. The experimental results demonstrate that Secureboost+ has significant performance improvements on large and high dimensional data sets compared to SecureBoost. It makes effective and efficient large-scale vertical federated learning possible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaibhav Mavi (New York University, United States of America), Anubhav Jangra (Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, India), Adam Jatowt (University of Innsbruck, Austria)</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of Question Answering (QA) has attracted significant research interest for long. Its relevance to language understanding and knowledge retrieval tasks, along with the simple setting makes the task of QA crucial for strong AI systems. Recent success on simple QA tasks has shifted the focus to more complex settings. Among these, Multi-Hop QA (MHQA) is one of the most researched tasks over the recent years. In broad terms, MHQA is the task of answering natural language questions that involve extracting and combining multiple pieces of information and doing multiple steps of reasoning. An example of a multi-hop question would be "The Argentine PGA Championship record holder has won how many tournaments worldwide?". Answering the question would need two pieces of information: "Who is the record holder for Argentine PGA Championship tournaments?" and "How many tournaments did [Answer of Sub Q1] win?". The ability to answer multi-hop questions and perform multi step reasoning can significantly improve the utility of NLP systems. Consequently, the field has seen a surge with high quality datasets, models and evaluation strategies. The notion of 'multiple hops' is somewhat abstract which results in a large variety of tasks that require multi-hop reasoning. This leads to different datasets and models that differ significantly from each other and makes the field challenging to generalize and survey. We aim to provide a general and formal definition of the MHQA task, and organize and summarize existing MHQA frameworks. We also outline some best practices for building MHQA datasets. This book provides a systematic and thorough introduction as well as the structuring of the existing attempts to this highly interesting, yet quite challenging task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ljubomir Rokvic, Panayiotis Danassis, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, Boi Faltings</p>
<p>Abstract: In Federated Learning, it is crucial to handle low-quality, corrupted, or malicious data. However, traditional data valuation methods are not suitable due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach that utilizes a new influence approximation called "lazy influence" to filter and score data while preserving privacy. To do this, each participant uses their own data to estimate the influence of another participant's batch and sends a differentially private obfuscated score to the central coordinator. Our method has been shown to successfully filter out biased and corrupted data in various simulated and real-world settings, achieving a recall rate of over $>90\%$ (sometimes up to $100\%$) while maintaining strong differential privacy guarantees with $\varepsilon \leq 1$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hubert Leterme, K\'evin Polisano, Val\'erie Perrier, Karteek Alahari</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to increase shift invariance and prediction accuracy in convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we replace the first-layer combination "real-valued convolutions + max pooling" (RMax) by "complex-valued convolutions + modulus" (CMod), which is stable to translations, or shifts. To justify our approach, we claim that CMod and RMax produce comparable outputs when the convolution kernel is band-pass and oriented (Gabor-like filter). In this context, CMod can therefore be considered as a stable alternative to RMax. To enforce this property, we constrain the convolution kernels to adopt such a Gabor-like structure. The corresponding architecture is called mathematical twin, because it employs a well-defined mathematical operator to mimic the behavior of the original, freely-trained model. Our approach achieves superior accuracy on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 classification tasks, compared to prior methods based on low-pass filtering. Arguably, our approach's emphasis on retaining high-frequency details contributes to a better balance between shift invariance and information preservation, resulting in improved performance. Furthermore, it has a lower computational cost and memory footprint than concurrent work, making it a promising solution for practical implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parvin Malekzadeh, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for developing decision-making agents that aim to maximize rewards, specified by an external supervisor, within fully observable environments. However, many real-world problems involve partial observations, formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Previous studies have tackled RL in POMDPs by either incorporating the memory of past actions and observations or by inferring the true state of the environment from observed data. However, aggregating observed data over time becomes impractical in continuous spaces. Moreover, inference-based RL approaches often require many samples to perform well, as they focus solely on reward maximization and neglect uncertainty in the inferred state. Active inference (AIF) is a framework formulated in POMDPs and directs agents to select actions by minimizing a function called expected free energy (EFE). This supplies reward-maximizing (exploitative) behaviour, as in RL, with information-seeking (exploratory) behaviour. Despite this exploratory behaviour of AIF, its usage is limited to discrete spaces due to the computational challenges associated with EFE. In this paper, we propose a unified principle that establishes a theoretical connection between AIF and RL, enabling seamless integration of these two approaches and overcoming their aforementioned limitations in continuous space POMDP settings. We substantiate our findings with theoretical analysis, providing novel perspectives for utilizing AIF in the design of artificial agents. Experimental results demonstrate the superior learning capabilities of our method in solving continuous space partially observable tasks. Notably, our approach harnesses information-seeking exploration, enabling it to effectively solve reward-free problems and rendering explicit task reward design by an external supervisor optional.</p>

<p>Abstract: The secondary structure of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is more stable and accessible in the cell than its tertiary structure, making it essential for functional prediction. Although deep learning has shown promising results in this field, current methods suffer from poor generalization and high complexity. In this work, we reformulate the RNA secondary structure prediction as a K-Rook problem, thereby simplifying the prediction process into probabilistic matching within a finite solution space. Building on this innovative perspective, we introduce RFold, a simple yet effective method that learns to predict the most matching K-Rook solution from the given sequence. RFold employs a bi-dimensional optimization strategy that decomposes the probabilistic matching problem into row-wise and column-wise components to reduce the matching complexity, simplifying the solving process while guaranteeing the validity of the output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFold achieves competitive performance and about eight times faster inference efficiency than the state-of-the-art approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinming Xu, Nasser Lashgarian Azad, Yuan Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Many optimal control problems require the simultaneous output of discrete and continuous control variables. These problems are usually formulated as mixed-integer optimal control (MIOC) problems, which are challenging to solve due to the complexity of the solution space. Numerical methods such as branch-and-bound are computationally expensive and undesirable for real-time control. This paper proposes a novel hybrid-action reinforcement learning (HARL) algorithm, twin delayed deep deterministic actor-Q (TD3AQ), for MIOC problems. TD3AQ combines the advantages of both actor-critic and Q-learning methods, and can handle the discrete and continuous action spaces simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) energy management problem, where real-time control of the discrete variables, clutch engagement/disengagement and gear shift, and continuous variable, engine torque, is essential to maximize fuel economy while satisfying driving constraints. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that TD3AQ achieves control results close to optimality when compared with dynamic programming (DP), with just 4.69% difference. Furthermore, it surpasses the performance of baseline reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tailin Zhou, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang, Danny H. K. Tsang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model averaging is a widely adopted technique in federated learning (FL) that aggregates multiple client models to obtain a global model. Remarkably, model averaging in FL yields a superior global model, even when client models are trained with non-convex objective functions and on heterogeneous local datasets. However, the rationale behind its success remains poorly understood. To shed light on this issue, we first visualize the loss landscape of FL over client and global models to illustrate their geometric properties. The visualization shows that the client models encompass the global model within a common basin, and interestingly, the global model may deviate from the basin's center while still outperforming the client models. To gain further insights into model averaging in FL, we decompose the expected loss of the global model into five factors related to the client models. Specifically, our analysis reveals that the global model loss after early training mainly arises from \textit{i)} the client model's loss on non-overlapping data between client datasets and the global dataset and \textit{ii)} the maximum distance between the global and client models. Based on the findings from our loss landscape visualization and loss decomposition, we propose utilizing iterative moving averaging (IMA) on the global model at the late training phase to reduce its deviation from the expected minimum, while constraining client exploration to limit the maximum distance between the global and client models. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating IMA into existing FL methods significantly improves their accuracy and training speed on various heterogeneous data setups of benchmark datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xue Yang, Zifeng Liu, Xiaohu Tang, Rongxing Lu, Bo Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the emergence of privacy leaks in federated learning, secure aggregation protocols that mainly adopt either homomorphic encryption or threshold secret sharing have been widely developed for federated learning to protect the privacy of the local training data of each client. However, these existing protocols suffer from many shortcomings, such as the dependence on a trusted third party, the vulnerability to clients being corrupted, low efficiency, the trade-off between security and fault tolerance, etc. To solve these disadvantages, we propose an efficient and multi-private key secure aggregation scheme for federated learning. Specifically, we skillfully modify the variant ElGamal encryption technique to achieve homomorphic addition operation, which has two important advantages: 1) The server and each client can freely select public and private keys without introducing a trust third party and 2) Compared to the variant ElGamal encryption, the plaintext space is relatively large, which is more suitable for the deep model. Besides, for the high dimensional deep model parameter, we introduce a super-increasing sequence to compress multi-dimensional data into 1-D, which can greatly reduce encryption and decryption times as well as communication for ciphertext transmission. Detailed security analyses show that our proposed scheme achieves the semantic security of both individual local gradients and the aggregated result while achieving optimal robustness in tolerating both client collusion and dropped clients. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the accuracy of our scheme is almost the same as the non-private approach, while the efficiency of our scheme is much better than the state-of-the-art homomorphic encryption-based secure aggregation schemes. More importantly, the efficiency advantages of our scheme will become increasingly prominent as the number of model parameters increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Naganuma, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ioannis Mitliagkas</p>
<p>Abstract: In out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization tasks, fine-tuning pre-trained models has become a prevalent strategy. Different from most prior work that has focused on advancing learning algorithms, we systematically examined how pre-trained model size, pre-training dataset size, and training strategies impact generalization and uncertainty calibration on downstream tasks. We evaluated 100 models across diverse pre-trained model sizes, \update{five} pre-training datasets, and five data augmentations through extensive experiments on four distribution shift datasets totaling over 120,000 GPU hours. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of pre-trained model selection, with optimal choices substantially improving OOD accuracy over algorithm improvement alone. We find larger models and bigger pre-training data improve OOD performance and calibration, in contrast to some prior studies that found modern deep networks to calibrate worse than classical shallow models. Our work underscores the overlooked importance of pre-trained model selection for out-of-distribution generalization and calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessy Lin, Yuqing Du, Olivia Watkins, Danijar Hafner, Pieter Abbeel, Dan Klein, Anca Dragan</p>
<p>Abstract: To interact with humans and act in the world, agents need to understand the range of language that people use and relate it to the visual world. While current agents can learn to execute simple language instructions, we aim to build agents that leverage diverse language -- language like "this button turns on the TV" or "I put the bowls away" -- that conveys general knowledge, describes the state of the world, provides interactive feedback, and more. Our key idea is that agents should interpret such diverse language as a signal that helps them predict the future: what they will observe, how the world will behave, and which situations will be rewarded. This perspective unifies language understanding with future prediction as a powerful self-supervised learning objective. We instantiate this in Dynalang, an agent that learns a multimodal world model to predict future text and image representations, and learns to act from imagined model rollouts. While current methods that learn language-conditioned policies degrade in performance with more diverse types of language, we show that Dynalang learns to leverage environment descriptions, game rules, and instructions to excel on tasks ranging from game-playing to navigating photorealistic home scans. Finally, we show that our method enables additional capabilities due to learning a generative model: Dynalang can be pretrained on text-only data, enabling learning from offline datasets, and generate language grounded in an environment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruocheng Wang, Eric Zelikman, Gabriel Poesia, Yewen Pu, Nick Haber, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: Inductive reasoning is a core problem-solving capacity: humans can identify underlying principles from a few examples, which robustly generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work evaluates large language models (LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding "in context learning." This works well for straightforward inductive tasks but performs poorly on complex tasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we propose to improve the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating explicit hypotheses at multiple levels of abstraction: we prompt the LLM to propose multiple abstract hypotheses about the problem, in natural language, then implement the natural language hypotheses as concrete Python programs. These programs can be verified by running on observed examples and generalized to novel inputs. To reduce the hypothesis search space, we explore steps to filter the set of hypotheses to implement: we either ask the LLM to summarize them into a smaller set of hypotheses or ask human annotators to select a subset. We verify our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive reasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, string transformation dataset SyGuS, and list transformation dataset List Functions. On a random 100-problem subset of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves 30% accuracy, outperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy of 17%). With the minimal human input of selecting from LLM-generated candidates, performance is boosted to 33%. Our ablations show that both abstract hypothesis generation and concrete program representations benefit LLMs on inductive reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Elenter, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Tara Javidi, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning is inherently a constrained learning problem. The goal is to learn a predictor under a no-forgetting requirement. Although several prior studies formulate it as such, they do not solve the constrained problem explicitly. In this work, we show that it is both possible and beneficial to undertake the constrained optimization problem directly. To do this, we leverage recent results in constrained learning through Lagrangian duality. We focus on memory-based methods, where a small subset of samples from previous tasks can be stored in a replay buffer. In this setting, we analyze two versions of the continual learning problem: a coarse approach with constraints at the task level and a fine approach with constraints at the sample level. We show that dual variables indicate the sensitivity of the optimal value of the continual learning problem with respect to constraint perturbations. We then leverage this result to partition the buffer in the coarse approach, allocating more resources to harder tasks, and to populate the buffer in the fine approach, including only impactful samples. We derive a deviation bound on dual variables as sensitivity indicators, and empirically corroborate this result in diverse continual learning benchmarks. We also discuss the limitations of these methods with respect to the amount of memory available and the expressiveness of the parametrization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqiang Lin, Zhaoxuan Wu, Zhongxiang Dai, Wenyang Hu, Yao Shu, See-Kiong Ng, Patrick Jaillet, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable instruction-following capabilities and achieved impressive performances in various applications. However, the performances of LLMs depend heavily on the instructions given to them, which are typically manually tuned with substantial human efforts. Recent work has used the query-efficient Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to automatically optimize the instructions given to black-box LLMs. However, BO usually falls short when optimizing highly sophisticated (e.g., high-dimensional) objective functions, such as the functions mapping an instruction to the performance of an LLM. This is mainly due to the limited expressive power of the Gaussian process (GP) which is used by BO as a surrogate to model the objective function. Meanwhile, it has been repeatedly shown that neural networks (NNs), especially pre-trained transformers, possess strong expressive power and can model highly complex functions. So, we adopt a neural bandit algorithm which replaces the GP in BO by an NN surrogate to optimize instructions for black-box LLMs. More importantly, the neural bandit algorithm allows us to naturally couple the NN surrogate with the hidden representation learned by a pre-trained transformer (i.e., an open-source LLM), which significantly boosts its performance. These motivate us to propose our INSTruction optimization usIng Neural bandits Coupled with Transformers (INSTINCT) algorithm. We perform instruction optimization for ChatGPT and use extensive experiments to show that INSTINCT consistently outperforms baselines in different tasks, e.g., various instruction induction tasks and the task of improving zero-shot chain-of-thought instructions.

Towards this goal, we first develop HarmonicFlow, an improved generative process over 3D protein-ligand binding structures based on our self-conditioned flow matching objective. FlowSite extends this flow model to jointly generate a protein pocket's discrete residue types and the molecule's binding 3D structure. We show that HarmonicFlow improves upon state-of-the-art generative processes for docking in simplicity, generality, and average sample quality in pocket-level docking. Enabled by this structure modeling, FlowSite designs binding sites substantially better than baseline approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qidong Liu, Xian Wu, Xiangyu Zhao, Yuanshao Zhu, Derong Xu, Feng Tian, Yefeng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent surge in Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention across numerous fields. Fine-tuning is often required to fit general LLMs for a specific domain, like the web-based healthcare system. However, two problems arise during fine-tuning LLMs for medical applications. One is the task variety problem, which involves distinct tasks in real-world medical scenarios. The variety often leads to sub-optimal fine-tuning for data imbalance and seesaw problems. Besides, the large amount of parameters in LLMs leads to huge time and computation consumption by fine-tuning. To address these two problems, we propose a novel parameter efficient fine-tuning framework for multi-task medical applications, dubbed as MOELoRA. The designed framework aims to absorb both the benefits of mixture-of-expert (MOE) for multi-task learning and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for parameter efficient fine-tuning. For unifying MOE and LoRA, we devise multiple experts as the trainable parameters, where each expert consists of a pair of low-rank matrices to retain the small size of trainable parameters. Then, a task-motivated gate function for all MOELoRA layers is proposed, which can control the contributions of each expert and produce distinct parameters for various tasks. We conduct experiments on a multi-task medical dataset, indicating MOELoRA outperforms the existing parameter efficient fine-tuning methods. The code is available online.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models loosely mimic bottom-up signal pathways from low-order sensory areas to high-order cognitive areas. After training, DL models can outperform humans on some domain-specific tasks, but their decision-making process has been known to be easily disrupted. Since the human brain consists of multiple functional areas highly connected to one another and relies on intricate interplays between bottom-up and top-down (from high-order to low-order areas) processing, we hypothesize that incorporating top-down signal processing may make DL models more robust. To address this hypothesis, we propose a certification process mimicking selective attention and test if it could make DL models more robust. Our empirical evaluations suggest that this newly proposed certification can improve DL models' accuracy and help us build safety measures to alleviate their vulnerabilities with both artificial and natural adversarial examples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative models can produce impressively realistic images. This paper demonstrates that generated images have geometric features different from those of real images. We build a set of collections of generated images, prequalified to fool simple, signal-based classifiers into believing they are real. We then show that prequalified generated images can be identified reliably by classifiers that only look at geometric properties. We use three such classifiers. All three classifiers are denied access to image pixels, and look only at derived geometric features. The first classifier looks at the perspective field of the image, the second looks at lines detected in the image, and the third looks at relations between detected objects and shadows. Our procedure detects generated images more reliably than SOTA local signal based detectors, for images from a number of distinct generators. Saliency maps suggest that the classifiers can identify geometric problems reliably. We conclude that current generators cannot reliably reproduce geometric properties of real images.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Albert Gu, Tri Dao</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers, renowned for their self-attention mechanism, have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, time-series modeling, etc. However, one of the challenges with deep Transformer models is the oversmoothing problem, where representations across layers converge to indistinguishable values, leading to significant performance degradation. We interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We propose a graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to learn a general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than that of the original self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that GFSA improves the performance of Transformers in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph regression, speech recognition, and code classification.</p>

We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs' belief changes in a persuasive dialogue.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Cui, Minghe Yu, Bo Jiang, Aimin Zhou, Jianyong Wang, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided education and intelligent tutoring systems, aiming to assess students' knowledge proficiency by predicting their future performance on new questions based on their past response records. While existing deep learning knowledge tracing (DLKT) methods have significantly improved prediction accuracy and achieved state-of-the-art results, they often suffer from a lack of interpretability. To address this limitation, current approaches have explored incorporating psychological influences to achieve more explainable predictions, but they tend to overlook the potential influences of historical responses. In fact, understanding how models make predictions based on response influences can enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of the knowledge tracing process, presenting an opportunity for a new paradigm of interpretable KT. However, measuring unobservable response influences is challenging. In this paper, we resort to counterfactual reasoning that intervenes in each response to answer \textit{what if a student had answered a question incorrectly that he/she actually answered correctly, and vice versa}. Based on this, we propose RCKT, a novel response influence-based counterfactual knowledge tracing framework. RCKT generates response influences by comparing prediction outcomes from factual sequences and constructed counterfactual sequences after interventions. Additionally, we introduce maximization and inference techniques to leverage accumulated influences from different past responses, further improving the model's performance and credibility. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our RCKT method outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods on four datasets against six baselines, and provides credible interpretations of response influences.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of transformer neural networks has significantly elevated the capabilities of sentence similarity models, but they struggle with highly discriminative tasks and produce sub-optimal representations of important documents like scientific literature. With the increased reliance on retrieval augmentation and search, representing diverse documents as concise and descriptive vectors is crucial. This paper improves upon the vectors embeddings of scientific literature by assembling niche datasets using co-citations as a similarity metric, focusing on biomedical domains. We apply a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) extension pipeline to pretrained BERT models, where every multi-layer perceptron section is enlarged and copied into multiple distinct experts. Our MoE variants perform well over $N$ scientific domains with $N$ dedicated experts, whereas standard BERT models excel in only one domain. Notably, extending just a single transformer block to MoE captures 85% of the benefit seen from full MoE extension at every layer. This holds promise for versatile and efficient One-Size-Fits-All transformer networks for numerically representing diverse inputs. Our methodology marks significant advancements in representing scientific text and holds promise for enhancing vector database search and compilation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain randomization is an effective computer vision technique for improving transferability of vision models across visually distinct domains exhibiting similar content. Existing approaches, however, rely extensively on tweaking complex and specialized simulation engines that are difficult to construct, subsequently affecting their feasibility and scalability. This paper introduces BehAVE, a video understanding framework that uniquely leverages the plethora of existing commercial video games for domain randomization, without requiring access to their simulation engines. Under BehAVE (1) the inherent rich visual diversity of video games acts as the source of randomization and (2) player behavior -- represented semantically via textual descriptions of actions -- guides the *alignment* of videos with similar content. We test BehAVE on 25 games of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre across various video and text foundation models and we report its robustness for domain randomization. BehAVE successfully aligns player behavioral patterns and is able to zero-shot transfer them to multiple unseen FPS games when trained on just one FPS game. In a more challenging setting, BehAVE manages to improve the zero-shot transferability of foundation models to unseen FPS games (up to 22%) even when trained on a game of a different genre (Minecraft).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elvis Dohmatob, Yunzhen Feng, Pu Yang, Francois Charton, Julia Kempe</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI model size grows, neural scaling laws have become a crucial tool to predict the improvements of large models when increasing capacity and the size of original (human or natural) training data. Yet, the widespread use of popular models means that the ecosystem of online data and text will co-evolve to progressively contain increased amounts of synthesized data. In this paper we ask: How will the scaling laws change in the inevitable regime where synthetic data makes its way into the training corpus? Will future models, still improve, or be doomed to degenerate up to total (model) collapse? We develop a theoretical framework of model collapse through the lens of scaling laws. We discover a wide range of decay phenomena, analyzing loss of scaling, shifted scaling with number of generations, the ''un-learning" of skills, and grokking when mixing human and synthesized data. Our theory is validated by large-scale experiments with a transformer on an arithmetic task and text generation using the large language model Llama2.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Guo, Adriana Meza Soria, Wei Sun, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce API Pack, a massive multi-programming language dataset containing more than 1 million instruction-API call pairs to improve the API call generation capabilities of large language models. By fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on 20,000 Python instances from API Pack, we achieved around 10% and 5% higher accuracy compared to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively, in generating unseen API calls. Fine-tuning on API Pack enables cross-programming language generalization by leveraging a large amount of data in one language and small amounts of data from other languages. Scaling the training data to 1 million instances further improves the model's generalization to new APIs not encountered during training. We open-source the API Pack dataset, trained models, and associated source code at https://github.com/zguo0525/API-Pack to facilitate further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengshuai Shi, Kun Yang, Zihan Chen, Jundong Li, Jing Yang, Cong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Long, Katy Ilonka Gero, Lydia B. Chilton</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI brings novel and impressive abilities to help people in everyday tasks. There are many AI workflows that solve real and complex problems by chaining AI outputs together with human interaction. Although there is an undeniable lure of AI, it is uncertain how useful generative AI workflows are after the novelty wears off. Additionally, workflows built with generative AI have the potential to be easily customized to fit users' individual needs, but do users take advantage of this? We conducted a three-week longitudinal study with 12 users to understand the familiarization and customization of generative AI tools for science communication. Our study revealed that there exists a familiarization phase, during which users were exploring the novel capabilities of the workflow and discovering which aspects they found useful. After this phase, users understood the workflow and were able to anticipate the outputs. Surprisingly, after familiarization the perceived utility of the system was rated higher than before, indicating that the perceived utility of AI is not just a novelty effect. The increase in benefits mainly comes from end-users' ability to customize prompts, and thus potentially appropriate the system to their own needs. This points to a future where generative AI systems can allow us to design for appropriation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijun Liu, Boqun Kou, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the strong performance of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, they still have reliability issues. Previous studies indicate that strong LLMs like GPT-4-turbo excel in evaluating the reliability of responses from LLMs, but face efficiency and local deployment issues. Thus, to enable weak LLMs to effectively assess the reliability of LLM responses, we propose a novel cross-query-comparison-based method called $\textit{Meta Ranking}$ (MR). Unlike previous few-shot methods that solely based on in-context learning capabilities in LLMs, MR assesses reliability by pairwisely ranking the target query-response pair with multiple reference query-response pairs. We found that MR is highly effective in error detection for LLM responses, where weak LLMs, such as Phi-2, could surpass strong baselines like GPT-3.5-turbo, requiring only five reference samples and significantly improving efficiency. We further demonstrate that MR can enhance strong LLMs' performance in two practical applications: model cascading and instruction tuning. In model cascading, we combine open- and closed-source LLMs to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4-turbo with lower costs. In instruction tuning, we use MR for iterative training data filtering, significantly reducing data processing time and enabling LLaMA-7B and Phi-2 to surpass Alpaca-13B with fewer training tokens. These results underscore the high potential of MR in both efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihong Dong, Xue Jiang, Huanyu Liu, Zhi Jin, Bin Gu, Mengfei Yang, Ge Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent statements about the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are usually supported by evaluating on open-access benchmarks. Considering the vast size and wide-ranging sources of LLMs' training data, it could explicitly or implicitly include test data, leading to LLMs being more susceptible to data contamination. However, due to the opacity of training data, the black-box access of models, and the rapid growth of synthetic training data, detecting and mitigating data contamination for LLMs faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose CDD, which stands for Contamination Detection via output Distribution for LLMs. CDD necessitates only the sampled texts to detect data contamination, by identifying the peakedness of LLM's output distribution. To mitigate the impact of data contamination in evaluation, we also present TED: Trustworthy Evaluation via output Distribution, based on the correction of LLM's output distribution. To facilitate this study, we introduce two benchmarks, i.e., DetCon and ComiEval, for data contamination detection and contamination mitigation evaluation tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CDD achieves the average relative improvements of 21.8\%-30.2\% over other contamination detection approaches in terms of Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC metrics, and can effectively detect implicit contamination. TED substantially mitigates performance improvements up to 66.9\% attributed to data contamination across various contamination setups. In real-world applications, we reveal that ChatGPT exhibits a high potential to suffer from data contamination on HumanEval benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative machine learning methods such as large-language models are revolutionizing the creation of text and images. While these models are powerful they also harness a large amount of computational resources. The transformer is a key component in large language models that aims to generate a suitable completion of a given partial sequence. In this work, we investigate transformer architectures under the lens of fault-tolerant quantum computing. The input model is one where trained weight matrices are given as block encodings and we construct the query, key, and value matrices for the transformer. We show how to prepare a block encoding of the self-attention matrix, with a new subroutine for the row-wise application of the softmax function. In addition, we combine quantum subroutines to construct important building blocks in the transformer, the residual connection and layer normalization, and the feed-forward neural network. Our subroutines prepare an amplitude encoding of the transformer output, which can be measured to obtain a prediction. Based on common open-source large-language models, we provide insights into the behavior of important parameters determining the run time of the quantum algorithm. We discuss the potential and challenges for obtaining a quantum advantage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qizhi Pei, Lijun Wu, Kaiyuan Gao, Xiaozhuan Liang, Yin Fang, Jinhua Zhu, Shufang Xie, Tao Qin, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research trends in computational biology have increasingly focused on integrating text and bio-entity modeling, especially in the context of molecules and proteins. However, previous efforts like BioT5 faced challenges in generalizing across diverse tasks and lacked a nuanced understanding of molecular structures, particularly in their textual representations (e.g., IUPAC). This paper introduces BioT5+, an extension of the BioT5 framework, tailored to enhance biological research and drug discovery. BioT5+ incorporates several novel features: integration of IUPAC names for molecular understanding, inclusion of extensive bio-text and molecule data from sources like bioRxiv and PubChem, the multi-task instruction tuning for generality across tasks, and a numerical tokenization technique for improved processing of numerical data. These enhancements allow BioT5+ to bridge the gap between molecular representations and their textual descriptions, providing a more holistic understanding of biological entities, and largely improving the grounded reasoning of bio-text and bio-sequences. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned with a large number of experiments, including \emph{3 types of problems (classification, regression, generation), 15 kinds of tasks, and 21 total benchmark datasets}, demonstrating the remarkable performance and state-of-the-art results in most cases. BioT5+ stands out for its ability to capture intricate relationships in biological data, thereby contributing significantly to bioinformatics and computational biology.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas M. Sutter, Yang Meng, Andrea Agostini, Daphn\'e Chopard, Norbert Fortin, Julia E. Vogt, Bahbak Shahbaba, Stephan Mandt</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational Autoencoders for multimodal data hold promise for many tasks in data analysis, such as representation learning, conditional generation, and imputation. Current architectures either share the encoder output, decoder input, or both across modalities to learn a shared representation. Such architectures impose hard constraints on the model. In this work, we show that a better latent representation can be obtained by replacing these hard constraints with a soft constraint. We propose a new mixture-of-experts prior, softly guiding each modality's latent representation towards a shared aggregate posterior. This approach results in a superior latent representation and allows each encoding to preserve information better from its uncompressed original features. In extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and two challenging real-world datasets, we show improved learned latent representations and imputation of missing data modalities compared to existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Grillotti, Maxence Faldor, Borja G. Le\'on, Antoine Cully</p>
<p>Abstract: A key aspect of intelligence is the ability to demonstrate a broad spectrum of behaviors for adapting to unexpected situations. Over the past decade, advancements in deep reinforcement learning have led to groundbreaking achievements to solve complex continuous control tasks. However, most approaches return only one solution specialized for a specific problem. We introduce Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), an off-policy actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages a value function critic and a successor features critic to learn high-performing and diverse behaviors. In this framework, the actor optimizes an objective that seamlessly unifies both critics using constrained optimization to (1) maximize return, while (2) executing diverse skills. Compared with other Quality-Diversity methods, QDAC achieves significantly higher performance and more diverse behaviors on six challenging continuous control locomotion tasks. We also demonstrate that we can harness the learned skills to adapt better than other baselines to five perturbed environments. Finally, qualitative analyses showcase a range of remarkable behaviors: adaptive-intelligent-robotics.github.io/QDAC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Casadio, Tanvi Dinkar, Ekaterina Komendantskaya, Luca Arnaboldi, Matthew L. Daggitt, Omri Isac, Guy Katz, Verena Rieser, Oliver Lemon</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited substantial success in the field of Natural Language Processing and ensuring their safety and reliability is crucial: there are safety critical contexts where such models must be robust to variability or attack, and give guarantees over their output. Unlike Computer Vision, NLP lacks a unified verification methodology and, despite recent advancements in literature, they are often light on the pragmatical issues of NLP verification. In this paper, we attempt to distil and evaluate general components of an NLP verification pipeline, that emerges from the progress in the field to date. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we give a general (i.e. algorithm-independent) characterisation of verifiable subspaces that result from embedding sentences into continuous spaces. We identify, and give an effective method to deal with, the technical challenge of semantic generalisability of verified subspaces; and propose it as a standard metric in the NLP verification pipelines (alongside with the standard metrics of model accuracy and model verifiability). Secondly, we propose a general methodology to analyse the effect of the embedding gap -- a problem that refers to the discrepancy between verification of geometric subspaces, and the semantic meaning of sentences which the geometric subspaces are supposed to represent. In extreme cases, poor choices in embedding of sentences may invalidate verification results. We propose a number of practical NLP methods that can help to quantify the effects of the embedding gap; and in particular we propose the metric of falsifiability of semantic subspaces as another fundamental metric to be reported as part of the NLP verification pipeline. We believe that together these general principles pave the way towards a more consolidated and effective development of this new domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the dynamic field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a transformative era for molecular studies. AI-driven NMR prediction, powered by advanced machine learning and predictive algorithms, has fundamentally reshaped the interpretation of NMR spectra. This innovation empowers us to forecast spectral patterns swiftly and accurately across a broad spectrum of molecular structures. Furthermore, the advent of generative modeling offers a groundbreaking approach, making it feasible to make informed prediction of 2D NMR from chemical language (such as SMILES, IUPAC Name). Our method mirrors the multifaceted nature of NMR imaging experiments, producing 2D NMRs for the same molecule based on different conditions, such as solvents and temperatures. Our methodology is versatile, catering to both monosaccharide-derived small molecules, oligosaccharides and large polysaccharides. A deeper exploration of the discrepancies in these predictions can provide insights into the influence of elements such as functional groups, repeating units, and the modification of the monomers on the outcomes. Given the complex nature involved in the generation of 2D NMRs, our objective is to fully leverage the potential of AI to enhance the precision, efficiency, and comprehensibility of NMR spectral analysis, ultimately advancing both the field of NMR spectroscopy and the broader realm of molecular research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robert Godwin-Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI offers significant opportunities for language learning. Tools like ChatGPT can provide informal second language practice through chats in written or voice forms, with the learner specifying through prompts conversational parameters such as proficiency level, language register, and discussion topics. AI can be instructed to give corrective feedback, create practice exercises, or develop an extended study plan. Instructors can use AI to build learning and assessment materials in a variety of media. AI is likely to make immersive technologies more powerful and versatile, moving away from scripted interactions. For both learners and teachers, it is important to understand the limitations of AI systems that arise from their purely statistical model of human language, which limits their ability to deal with nuanced social and cultural aspects of language use. Additionally, there are ethical concerns over how AI systems are created as well as practical constraints in their use, especially for less privileged populations. The power and versatility of AI tools are likely to turn them into valuable and constant companions in many peoples lives (akin to smartphones), creating a close connection that goes beyond simple tool use. Ecological theories such as sociomaterialism are helpful in examining the shared agency that develops through close user-AI interactions, as are the perspectives on human-object relations from Indigenous cultures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwoong Im, Nayoung Kwon, Taewoo Park, Jiheon Woo, Jaeho Lee, Yongjune Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework in the domain of edge inference, focusing on the efficient use of vision transformer (ViT) models. The partitioning strategy of conventional collaborative inference fails to reduce communication cost because of the inherent architecture of ViTs maintaining consistent layer dimensions across the entire transformer encoder. Therefore, instead of employing the partitioning strategy, our framework utilizes a lightweight ViT model on the edge device, with the server deploying a complicated ViT model. To enhance communication efficiency and achieve the classification accuracy of the server model, we propose two strategies: 1) attention-aware patch selection and 2) entropy-aware image transmission. Attention-aware patch selection leverages the attention scores generated by the edge device's transformer encoder to identify and select the image patches critical for classification. This strategy enables the edge device to transmit only the essential patches to the server, significantly improving communication efficiency. Entropy-aware image transmission uses min-entropy as a metric to accurately determine whether to depend on the lightweight model on the edge device or to request the inference from the server model. In our framework, the lightweight ViT model on the edge device acts as a semantic encoder, efficiently identifying and selecting the crucial image information required for the classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed collaborative inference framework can reduce communication overhead by 68% with only a minimal loss in accuracy compared to the server model on the ImageNet dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Tang, Ray Zhang, Jiaming Liu, Zoey Guo, Dong Wang, Zhigang Wang, Bin Zhao, Shanghang Zhang, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios. Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amortized Bayesian inference trains neural networks to solve stochastic inference problems using model simulations, thereby making it possible to rapidly perform Bayesian inference for any newly observed data. However, current simulation-based amortized inference methods are simulation-hungry and inflexible: They require the specification of a fixed parametric prior, simulator, and inference tasks ahead of time. Here, we present a new amortized inference method -- the Simformer -- which overcomes these limitations. By training a probabilistic diffusion model with transformer architectures, the Simformer outperforms current state-of-the-art amortized inference approaches on benchmark tasks and is substantially more flexible: It can be applied to models with function-valued parameters, it can handle inference scenarios with missing or unstructured data, and it can sample arbitrary conditionals of the joint distribution of parameters and data, including both posterior and likelihood. We showcase the performance and flexibility of the Simformer on simulators from ecology, epidemiology, and neuroscience, and demonstrate that it opens up new possibilities and application domains for amortized Bayesian inference on simulation-based models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been extensively used in data generation tasks and are recognized as one of the best generative models. However, their time-consuming deployment, long inference time, and requirements on large memory limit their application on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a method based on the improved Straight-Through Estimator to improve the deployment efficiency of diffusion models. Specifically, we add sparse masks to the Convolution and Linear layers in a pre-trained diffusion model, then use design progressive sparsity for model training in the fine-tuning stage, and switch the inference mask on and off, which supports a flexible choice of sparsity during inference according to the FID and MACs requirements. Experiments on four datasets conducted on a state-of-the-art Transformer-based diffusion model demonstrate that our method reduces MACs by $50\%$ while increasing FID by only 1.5 on average. Under other MACs conditions, the FID is also lower than 1$\sim$137 compared to other methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: The study of time series data is crucial for understanding trends and anomalies over time, enabling predictive insights across various sectors. Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis A. Leiva, V. Javier Traver, Alexandra Kawala-Sterniuk, Tuukka Ruotsalo</p>
<p>Abstract: Present Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) technology allows inference and detection of cognitive and affective states, but fairly little has been done to study scenarios in which such information can facilitate new applications that rely on modeling human cognition. One state that can be quantified from various physiological signals is attention. Estimates of human attention can be used to reveal preferences and novel dimensions of user experience. Previous approaches have tackled these incredibly challenging tasks using a variety of behavioral signals, from dwell-time to click-through data, and computational models of visual correspondence to these behavioral signals. However, behavioral signals are only rough estimations of the real underlying attention and affective preferences of the users. Indeed, users may attend to some content simply because it is salient, but not because it is really interesting, or simply because it is outrageous. With this paper, we put forward a research agenda and example work using BCI to infer users' preferences, their attentional correlates towards visual content, and their associations with affective experience. Subsequently, we link these to relevant applications, such as information retrieval, personalized steering of generative models, and crowdsourcing population estimates of affective experiences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zoey Chen, Aaron Walsman, Marius Memmel, Kaichun Mo, Alex Fang, Karthikeya Vemuri, Alan Wu, Dieter Fox, Abhishek Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Constructing simulation scenes that are both visually and physically realistic is a problem of practical interest in domains ranging from robotics to computer vision. This problem has become even more relevant as researchers wielding large data-hungry learning methods seek new sources of training data for physical decision-making systems. However, building simulation models is often still done by hand. A graphic designer and a simulation engineer work with predefined assets to construct rich scenes with realistic dynamic and kinematic properties. While this may scale to small numbers of scenes, to achieve the generalization properties that are required for data-driven robotic control, we require a pipeline that is able to synthesize large numbers of realistic scenes, complete with 'natural' kinematic and dynamic structures. To attack this problem, we develop models for inferring structure and generating simulation scenes from natural images, allowing for scalable scene generation from web-scale datasets. To train these image-to-simulation models, we show how controllable text-to-image generative models can be used in generating paired training data that allows for modeling of the inverse problem, mapping from realistic images back to complete scene models. We show how this paradigm allows us to build large datasets of scenes in simulation with semantic and physical realism. We present an integrated end-to-end pipeline that generates simulation scenes complete with articulated kinematic and dynamic structures from real-world images and use these for training robotic control policies. We then robustly deploy in the real world for tasks like articulated object manipulation. In doing so, our work provides both a pipeline for large-scale generation of simulation environments and an integrated system for training robust robotic control policies in the resulting environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunhui Zhang, Li Liu, Hao Wen, Xi Zhou, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking (MMOT) is an emerging field that combines data from various modalities, \eg vision (RGB), depth, thermal infrared, event, language and audio, to estimate the state of an arbitrary object in a video sequence. It is of great significance for many applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance. In recent years, MMOT has received more and more attention. However, existing MMOT algorithms mainly focus on two modalities (\eg RGB+depth, RGB+thermal infrared, and RGB+language). To leverage more modalities, some recent efforts have been made to learn a unified visual object tracking model for any modality. Additionally, some large-scale multi-modal tracking benchmarks have been established by simultaneously providing more than two modalities, such as vision-language-audio (\eg WebUAV-3M) and vision-depth-language (\eg UniMod1K). To track the latest progress in MMOT, we conduct a comprehensive investigation in this report. Specifically, we first divide existing MMOT tasks into five main categories, \ie RGBL tracking, RGBE tracking, RGBD tracking, RGBT tracking, and miscellaneous (RGB+X), where X can be any modality, such as language, depth, and event. Then, we analyze and summarize each MMOT task, focusing on widely used datasets and mainstream tracking algorithms based on their technical paradigms (\eg self-supervised learning, prompt learning, knowledge distillation, generative models, and state space models). Finally, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for MMOT at https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing learning rate schedules that do not require specification of the optimization stopping step T are greatly out-performed by learning rate schedules that depend on T. We propose an approach that avoids the need for this stopping time by eschewing the use of schedules entirely, while exhibiting state-of-the-art performance compared to schedules across a wide family of problems ranging from convex problems to large-scale deep learning problems. Our Schedule-Free approach introduces no additional hyper-parameters over standard optimizers with momentum. Our method is a direct consequence of a new theory we develop that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging. An open source implementation of our method is available (https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Yang, Carlos E. Jimenez, Alexander Wettig, Kilian Lieret, Shunyu Yao, Karthik Narasimhan, Ofir Press</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly being used to automate complicated tasks in digital environments. Just as humans benefit from powerful software applications, such as integrated development environments, for complex tasks like software engineering, we posit that LM agents represent a new category of end users with their own needs and abilities, and would benefit from specially-built interfaces to the software they use. We investigate how interface design affects the performance of language model agents. As a result of this exploration, we introduce SWE-agent: a system that facilitates LM agents to autonomously use computers to solve software engineering tasks. SWE-agent's custom agent-computer interface (ACI) significantly enhances an agent's ability to create and edit code files, navigate entire repositories, and execute tests and other programs. We evaluate SWE-agent on SWE-bench and HumanEvalFix, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both with a pass@1 rate of 12.5% and 87.7%, respectively, far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art achieved with non-interactive LMs. Finally, we provide insight on how the design of the ACI can impact agents' behavior and performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vicky Zayats, Peter Chen, Melissa Ferrari, Dirk Padfield</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating multiple generative foundation models, especially those trained on different modalities, into something greater than the sum of its parts poses significant challenges. Two key hurdles are the availability of aligned data (concepts that contain similar meaning but is expressed differently in different modalities), and effectively leveraging unimodal representations in cross-domain generative tasks, without compromising their original unimodal capabilities.
  We propose Zipper, a multi-tower decoder architecture that addresses these concerns by using cross-attention to flexibly compose multimodal generative models from independently pre-trained unimodal decoders. In our experiments fusing speech and text modalities, we show the proposed architecture performs very competitively in scenarios with limited aligned text-speech data. We also showcase the flexibility of our model to selectively maintain unimodal (e.g., text-to-text generation) generation performance by freezing the corresponding modal tower (e.g. text). In cross-modal tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) where the output modality is text, we show that freezing the text backbone results in negligible performance degradation. In cross-modal tasks such as text-to-speech generation (TTS) where the output modality is speech, we show that using a pre-trained speech backbone results in superior performance to the baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqun Liu, Jiacheng Liang, Muchao Ye, Zhaohan Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable when trained on datasets containing harmful content, which leads to potential jailbreaking attacks in two scenarios: the integration of harmful texts within crowdsourced data used for pre-training and direct tampering with LLMs through fine-tuning. In both scenarios, adversaries can compromise the safety alignment of LLMs, exacerbating malfunctions. Motivated by the need to mitigate these adversarial influences, our research aims to enhance safety alignment by either neutralizing the impact of malicious texts in pre-training datasets or increasing the difficulty of jailbreaking during downstream fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a data curation framework designed to counter adversarial impacts in both scenarios. Our method operates under the assumption that we have no prior knowledge of attack details, focusing solely on curating clean texts. We introduce an iterative process aimed at revising texts to reduce their perplexity as perceived by LLMs, while simultaneously preserving their text quality. By pre-training or fine-tuning LLMs with curated clean texts, we observe a notable improvement in LLM robustness regarding safety alignment against harmful queries. For instance, when pre-training LLMs using a crowdsourced dataset containing 5\% harmful instances, adding an equivalent amount of curated texts significantly mitigates the likelihood of providing harmful responses in LLMs and reduces the attack success rate by 71\%. Our study represents a significant step towards mitigating the risks associated with training-based jailbreaking and fortifying the secure utilization of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Liu, Sai Qian Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently gained substantial attention in both industrial and academic fields for their superior visual generation capabilities, outperforming traditional diffusion models that use U-Net. However,the enhanced performance of DiTs also comes with high parameter counts and implementation costs, seriously restricting their use on resource-limited devices such as mobile phones. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hybrid Floating-point Quantization for DiT(HQ-DiT), an efficient post-training quantization method that utilizes 4-bit floating-point (FP) precision on both weights and activations for DiT inference. Compared to fixed-point quantization (e.g., INT8), FP quantization, complemented by our proposed clipping range selection mechanism, naturally aligns with the data distribution within DiT, resulting in a minimal quantization error. Furthermore, HQ-DiT also implements a universal identity mathematical transform to mitigate the serious quantization error caused by the outliers. The experimental results demonstrate that DiT can achieve extremely low-precision quantization (i.e., 4 bits) with negligible impact on performance. Our approach marks the first instance where both weights and activations in DiTs are quantized to just 4 bits, with only a 0.12 increase in sFID on ImageNet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dylan Zhang, Justin Wang, Francois Charton</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning -- tuning large language models on instruction-output pairs -- is a promising technique for making models better adapted to the real world. Yet, the key factors driving the model's capability to understand and follow instructions not seen during training remain under-explored. Our investigation begins with a series of synthetic experiments within the theoretical framework of a Turing-complete algorithm called Markov algorithm, which allows fine-grained control over the instruction-tuning data. Generalization and robustness with respect to the training distribution emerge once a diverse enough set of tasks is provided, even though very few examples are provided for each task. We extend these initial results to a real-world application scenario of code generation and find that a more diverse instruction set, extending beyond code-related tasks, improves the performance of code generation. Our observations suggest that a more diverse semantic space for instruction-tuning sets greatly improves the model's ability to follow instructions and perform tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hossam M. Zawbaa, Wael Rashwan, Sourav Dutta, Haytham Assem</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope user utterances is essential for task-oriented dialogues and intent classification. Current methodologies face difficulties with the unpredictable distribution of outliers and often rely on assumptions about data distributions. We present the Dual Encoder for Threshold-Based Re-Classification (DETER) to address these challenges. This end-to-end framework efficiently detects out-of-scope intents without requiring assumptions on data distributions or additional post-processing steps. The core of DETER utilizes dual text encoders, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and the Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder (TSDAE), to generate user utterance embeddings, which are classified through a branched neural architecture. Further, DETER generates synthetic outliers using self-supervision and incorporates out-of-scope phrases from open-domain datasets. This approach ensures a comprehensive training set for out-of-scope detection. Additionally, a threshold-based re-classification mechanism refines the model's initial predictions. Evaluations on the CLINC-150, Stackoverflow, and Banking77 datasets demonstrate DETER's efficacy. Our model outperforms previous benchmarks, increasing up to 13% and 5% in F1 score for known and unknown intents on CLINC-150 and Stackoverflow, and 16% for known and 24% % for unknown intents on Banking77.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19996">DP-IQA: Utilizing Diffusion Prior for Blind Image Quality Assessment in the Wild</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Honghao Fu, Yufei Wang, Wenhan Yang, Bihan Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) plays a critical role in selecting high-quality images and guiding compression and enhancement methods in a series of applications. The blind IQA, which assesses the quality of in-the-wild images containing complex authentic distortions without reference images, poses greater challenges. Existing methods are limited to modeling a uniform distribution with local patches and are bothered by the gap between low and high-level visions (caused by widely adopted pre-trained classification networks). In this paper, we propose a novel IQA method called diffusion priors-based IQA (DP-IQA), which leverages the prior knowledge from the pre-trained diffusion model with its excellent powers to bridge semantic gaps in the perception of the visual quality of images. Specifically, we use pre-trained stable diffusion as the backbone, extract multi-level features from the denoising U-Net during the upsampling process at a specified timestep, and decode them to estimate the image quality score. The text and image adapters are adopted to mitigate the domain gap for downstream tasks and correct the information loss caused by the variational autoencoder bottleneck. Finally, we distill the knowledge in the above model into a CNN-based student model, significantly reducing the parameter to enhance applicability, with the student model performing similarly or even better than the teacher model surprisingly. Experimental results demonstrate that our DP-IQA achieves state-of-the-art results on various in-the-wild datasets with better generalization capability, which shows the superiority of our method in global modeling and utilizing the hierarchical feature clues of diffusion for evaluating image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Wu, Boyuan Jiang, Zhengkai Jiang, Qingdong He, Donghao Luo, Shengzhi Wang, Qingwen Liu, Chengjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) contribute a powerful mechanism to understanding visual information building on large language models. However, MLLMs are notorious for suffering from hallucinations, especially when generating lengthy, detailed descriptions for images. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations stem from the inherent summarization mechanism of large language models, leading to excessive dependence on linguistic tokens while neglecting vision information. In this paper, we propose NoiseBoost, a broadly applicable and simple method for alleviating hallucinations for MLLMs through the integration of noise feature perturbations. Noise perturbation acts as a regularizer, facilitating a balanced distribution of attention weights among visual and linguistic tokens. Despite its simplicity, NoiseBoost consistently enhances the performance of MLLMs across common training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Further, NoiseBoost pioneerly enables semi-supervised learning for MLLMs, unleashing the power of unlabeled data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NoiseBoost improves dense caption accuracy by 8.1% with human evaluation and achieves comparable results with 50% of the data by mining unlabeled data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alaa Nfissi, Wassim Bouachir, Nizar Bouguila, Brian Mishara</p>
<p>Abstract: In speech emotion recognition (SER), using predefined features without considering their practical importance may lead to high dimensional datasets, including redundant and irrelevant information. Consequently, high-dimensional learning often results in decreasing model accuracy while increasing computational complexity. Our work underlines the importance of carefully considering and analyzing features in order to build efficient SER systems. We present a new supervised SER method based on an efficient feature engineering approach. We pay particular attention to the explainability of results to evaluate feature relevance and refine feature sets. This is performed iteratively through feature evaluation loop, using Shapley values to boost feature selection and improve overall framework performance. Our approach allows thus to balance the benefits between model performance and transparency. The proposed method outperforms human-level performance (HLP) and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in emotion recognition on the TESS dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Ganeshan, Ryan Y. Huang, Xianghao Xu, R. Kenny Jones, Daniel Ritchie</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to edit 3D assets from natural language presents a compelling paradigm to aid in the democratization of 3D content creation. However, while natural language is often effective at communicating general intent, it is poorly suited for specifying precise manipulation. To address this gap, we introduce ParSEL, a system that enables controllable editing of high-quality 3D assets from natural language. Given a segmented 3D mesh and an editing request, ParSEL produces a parameterized editing program. Adjusting the program parameters allows users to explore shape variations with a precise control over the magnitudes of edits. To infer editing programs which align with an input edit request, we leverage the abilities of large-language models (LLMs). However, while we find that LLMs excel at identifying initial edit operations, they often fail to infer complete editing programs, and produce outputs that violate shape semantics. To overcome this issue, we introduce Analytical Edit Propagation (AEP), an algorithm which extends a seed edit with additional operations until a complete editing program has been formed. Unlike prior methods, AEP searches for analytical editing operations compatible with a range of possible user edits through the integration of computer algebra systems for geometric analysis. Experimentally we demonstrate ParSEL's effectiveness in enabling controllable editing of 3D objects through natural language requests over alternative system designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dixuan Lin, Yuxiang Zhang, Mengcheng Li, Yebin Liu, Wei Jing, Qi Yan, Qianying Wang, Hongwen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce 4DHands, a robust approach to recovering interactive hand meshes and their relative movement from monocular inputs. Our approach addresses two major limitations of previous methods: lacking a unified solution for handling various hand image inputs and neglecting the positional relationship of two hands within images. To overcome these challenges, we develop a transformer-based architecture with novel tokenization and feature fusion strategies. Specifically, we propose a Relation-aware Two-Hand Tokenization (RAT) method to embed positional relation information into the hand tokens. In this way, our network can handle both single-hand and two-hand inputs and explicitly leverage relative hand positions, facilitating the reconstruction of intricate hand interactions in real-world scenarios. As such tokenization indicates the relative relationship of two hands, it also supports more effective feature fusion. To this end, we further develop a Spatio-temporal Interaction Reasoning (SIR) module to fuse hand tokens in 4D with attention and decode them into 3D hand meshes and relative temporal movements. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmark datasets. The results on in-the-wild videos and real-world scenarios demonstrate the superior performances of our approach for interactive hand reconstruction.
