<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikolai Rozanov, Marek Rei</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning and acting to solve `real' tasks using large language models (LLMs) in interactive environments has become a new frontier for AI methods. While recent advances allowed LLMs to interact with online tools, solve robotics tasks and many more, long range reasoning tasks remain a problem for LLMs. Existing methods to address this issue are very resource intensive and require additional data or human crafted rules, instead, we propose a simple method based on few-shot in-context learning alone to enhance `chain-of-thought' with state-tracking for planning and acting with LLMs. We show that our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on Alfworld for in-context learning methods (\textbf{+14\%} over the previous best few-shot in-context learning method) and performs on par with methods that use additional training data and additional tools such as code-execution. We also demonstrate that our enhanced `chain-of-states' allows the agent to both solve longer horizon problems and to be more efficient in number of steps required to solve a task. We show that our method works across a variety of LLMs for both API-based and open source ones. Finally, we also conduct ablation studies and show that `chain-of-thoughts' helps state-tracking accuracy, while a json-structure harms overall performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanzhu Chen, Xu Shen, Qitan Lv, Jie Wang, Xiaoqi Ni, Jieping Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a pivotal role in knowledge-intensive tasks across specialized domains, where the acquisition of precise and dependable knowledge is crucial. However, existing KG construction methods heavily rely on human intervention to attain qualified KGs, which severely hinders the practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a general KG construction framework, named SAC-KG, to exploit large language models (LLMs) as Skilled Automatic Constructors for domain Knowledge Graph. SAC-KG effectively involves LLMs as domain experts to generate specialized and precise multi-level KGs. Specifically, SAC-KG consists of three components: Generator, Verifier, and Pruner. For a given entity, Generator produces its relations and tails from raw domain corpora, to construct a specialized single-level KG. Verifier and Pruner then work together to ensure precision by correcting generation errors and determining whether newly produced tails require further iteration for the next-level KG.Experiments demonstrate that SAC-KG automatically constructs a domain KG at the scale of over one million nodes and achieves a precision of 89.32%, leading to a superior performance with over 20% increase in precision rate compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for the KG construction task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Eugenia Cornejo, David Lobo, Jes\'us Medina</p>
<p>Abstract: Bipolar fuzzy relation equations arise as a generalization of fuzzy relation equations considering unknown variables together with their logical connective negations. The occurrence of a variable and the occurrence of its negation simultaneously can give very useful information for certain frameworks where the human reasoning plays a key role. Hence, the resolution of bipolar fuzzy relation equations systems is a research topic of great interest.
  This paper focuses on the study of bipolar fuzzy relation equations systems based on the max-product t-norm composition. Specifically, the solvability and the algebraic structure of the set of solutions of these bipolar equations systems will be studied, including the case in which such systems are composed of equations whose independent term be equal to zero. As a consequence, this paper complements the contribution carried out by the authors on the solvability of bipolar max-product fuzzy relation equations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We investigate whether biases inherent in human cognition, such as loss aversion, framing effects, and conjunction fallacy, manifest in how GPT-4o judges and makes decisions in probabilistic scenarios. By conducting 1350 experiments across nine cognitive biases and analyzing the responses for statistical versus heuristic reasoning, we demonstrate GPT-4o's contradicting approach while responding to prompts with similar underlying probability notations. Our findings also reveal mixed performances with the AI demonstrating both human-like heuristic errors and statistically sound decisions, even as it goes through identical iterations of the same prompt.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinh Luong, Sang Dinh, Shruti Raghavan, William Nguyen, Zooey Nguyen, Quynh Le, Hung Vo, Kentaro Maegaito, Loc Nguyen, Thao Nguyen, Anh Hai Ha, Christopher Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their inherent probabilistic nature often leads to inconsistency and inaccuracy in complex problem-solving tasks. This paper introduces DANA (Domain-Aware Neurosymbolic Agent), an architecture that addresses these issues by integrating domain-specific knowledge with neurosymbolic approaches. We begin by analyzing current AI architectures, including AutoGPT, LangChain ReAct and OpenAI's ChatGPT, through a neurosymbolic lens, highlighting how their reliance on probabilistic inference contributes to inconsistent outputs. In response, DANA captures and applies domain expertise in both natural-language and symbolic forms, enabling more deterministic and reliable problem-solving behaviors. We implement a variant of DANA using Hierarchical Task Plans (HTPs) in the open-source OpenSSA framework. This implementation achieves over 90\% accuracy on the FinanceBench financial-analysis benchmark, significantly outperforming current LLM-based systems in both consistency and accuracy. Application of DANA in physical industries such as semiconductor shows that its flexible architecture for incorporating knowledge is effective in mitigating the probabilistic limitations of LLMs and has potential in tackling complex, real-world problems that require reliability and precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Xiao, Brenda Z. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as autonomous agents across various tasks. One emerging application is the use of LLMs in playing games. In this work, we explore a practical problem for the gaming industry: Can LLMs be used to measure game difficulty? We propose a general game-testing framework using LLM agents and test it on two widely played strategy games: Wordle and Slay the Spire. Our results reveal an interesting finding: although LLMs may not perform as well as the average human player, their performance, when guided by simple, generic prompting techniques, shows a statistically significant and strong correlation with difficulty indicated by human players. This suggests that LLMs could serve as effective agents for measuring game difficulty during the development process. Based on our experiments, we also outline general principles and guidelines for incorporating LLMs into the game testing process.</p>

<p>Abstract: The meteoric rise of online games has created a need for accurate skill rating systems for tracking improvement and fair matchmaking. Although many skill rating systems are deployed, with various theoretical foundations, less work has been done at analysing the real-world performance of these algorithms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Di Zhang, Jianbo Wu, Jingdi Lei, Tong Che, Jiatong Li, Tong Xie, Xiaoshui Huang, Shufei Zhang, Marco Pavone, Yuqiang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Dongzhan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an advanced mathematical problem-solving framework, LLaMA-Berry, for enhancing the mathematical reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with iterative Self-Refine to optimize the reasoning path and utilizes a pairwise reward model to evaluate different paths globally. By leveraging the self-critic and rewriting capabilities of LLMs, Self-Refine applied to MCTS (SR-MCTS) overcomes the inefficiencies and limitations of conventional step-wise and greedy search algorithms by fostering a more efficient exploration of solution spaces. Pairwise Preference Reward Model~(PPRM), inspired by Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), is then used to model pairwise preferences between solutions, utilizing an Enhanced Borda Count (EBC) method to synthesize these preferences into a global ranking score to find better answers. This approach addresses the challenges of scoring variability and non-independent distributions in mathematical reasoning tasks. The framework has been tested on general and advanced benchmarks, showing superior performance in terms of search efficiency and problem-solving capability compared to existing methods like ToT and rStar, particularly in complex Olympiad-level benchmarks, including GPQA, AIME24 and AMC23.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02892">The Role of Deductive and Inductive Reasoning in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengkun Cai, Xu Zhao, Haoliang Liu, Zhongyu Jiang, Tianfang Zhang, Zongkai Wu, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in artificial intelligence, particularly in reasoning tasks. However, their reliance on static prompt structures, coupled with limited dynamic reasoning capabilities, often constrains their adaptability to complex and evolving problem spaces. In this paper, we propose the Deductive and InDuctive(DID) method, which enhances LLM reasoning by dynamically integrating both deductive and inductive reasoning within the prompt construction process. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, the DID approach mirrors human adaptive reasoning mechanisms, offering a flexible framework that allows the model to adjust its reasoning pathways based on task context and performance. We empirically validate the efficacy of DID on established datasets such as AIW and MR-GSM8K, as well as on our custom dataset, Holiday Puzzle, which presents tasks about different holiday date calculating challenges. By leveraging DID's hybrid prompt strategy, we demonstrate significant improvements in both solution accuracy and reasoning quality, achieved without imposing substantial computational overhead. Our findings suggest that DID provides a more robust and cognitively aligned framework for reasoning in LLMs, contributing to the development of advanced LLM-driven problem-solving strategies informed by cognitive science models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianzhi Li, Ran Zmigrod, Zhiqiang Ma, Xiaomo Liu, Xiaodan Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models are capable of memorizing detailed patterns and information, leading to a double-edged effect: they achieve impressive modeling performance on downstream tasks with the stored knowledge but also raise significant privacy concerns. Traditional differential privacy based training approaches offer robust safeguards by employing a uniform noise distribution across all parameters. However, this overlooks the distinct sensitivities and contributions of individual parameters in privacy protection and often results in suboptimal models. To address these limitations, we propose ANADP, a novel algorithm that adaptively allocates additive noise based on the importance of model parameters. We demonstrate that ANADP narrows the performance gap between regular fine-tuning and traditional DP fine-tuning on a series of datasets while maintaining the required privacy constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Hu, You Zhou, Jie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Overall Performance Index (OPI), an intrinsic metric to evaluate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanisms for applications involving deep-logic queries. OPI is computed as the harmonic mean of two key metrics: the Logical-Relation Correctness Ratio and the average of BERT embedding similarity scores between ground-truth and generated answers. We apply OPI to assess the performance of LangChain, a popular RAG tool, using a logical relations classifier fine-tuned from GPT-4o on the RAG-Dataset-12000 from Hugging Face. Our findings show a strong correlation between BERT embedding similarity scores and extrinsic evaluation scores. Among the commonly used retrievers, the cosine similarity retriever using BERT-based embeddings outperforms others, while the Euclidean distance-based retriever exhibits the weakest performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining multiple retrievers, either algorithmically or by merging retrieved sentences, yields superior performance compared to using any single retriever alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Nuernberger, Anny Liu, Heather Stefanini, Richard Otis, Amanda Towler, R. Peter Dillon</p>
<p>Abstract: Instructions for Build, Assembly, and Test (IBAT) refers to the process used whenever any operation is conducted on hardware, including tests, assembly, and maintenance. Currently, the generation of IBAT documents is time-intensive, as users must manually reference and transfer information from engineering diagrams and parts lists into IBAT instructions. With advances in machine learning and computer vision, however, it is possible to have an artificial intelligence (AI) model perform the partial filling of the IBAT template, freeing up engineer time for more highly skilled tasks. AiBAT is a novel system for assisting users in authoring IBATs. It works by first analyzing assembly drawing documents, extracting information and parsing it, and then filling in IBAT templates with the extracted information. Such assisted authoring has potential to save time and reduce cost. This paper presents an overview of the AiBAT system, including promising preliminary results and discussion on future work.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02992">Guided Stream of Search: Learning to Better Search with Language Models via Optimal Path Guidance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungyong Moon, Bumsoo Park, Hyun Oh Song</p>
<p>Abstract: While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of tasks, they still struggle with tasks that require complex planning and reasoning. Recent studies have proposed training language models on search processes rather than optimal solutions, resulting in better generalization performance even though search processes are noisy and even suboptimal. However, these studies overlook the value of optimal solutions, which can serve as step-by-step landmarks to guide more effective search. In this work, we explore how to leverage optimal solutions to enhance the search and planning abilities of language models. To this end, we propose guided stream of search (GSoS), which seamlessly incorporates optimal solutions into the self-generation process in a progressive manner, producing high-quality search trajectories. These trajectories are then distilled into the pre-trained model via supervised fine-tuning. Our approach significantly enhances the search and planning abilities of language models on Countdown, a simple yet challenging mathematical reasoning task. Notably, combining our method with RL fine-tuning yields further improvements, whereas previous supervised fine-tuning methods do not benefit from RL. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater effectiveness than leveraging optimal solutions in the form of subgoal rewards.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03062">Image First or Text First? Optimising the Sequencing of Modalities in Large Language Model Prompting and Reasoning Tasks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Grant Wardle, Teo Susnjak</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper examines how the sequencing of images and text within multi-modal prompts influences the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). We performed empirical evaluations using three commercial LLMs. Our results demonstrate that the order in which modalities are presented can significantly affect performance, particularly in tasks of varying complexity. For simpler tasks involving a single image, modality sequencing had a clear impact on accuracy. However, in more complex tasks involving multiple images and intricate reasoning steps, the effect of sequencing diminished, likely due to the increased cognitive demands of the task. Our findings also highlight the importance of question/prompt structure. In nested and multi-step reasoning tasks, modality sequencing played a key role in shaping model performance. While LLMs excelled in the initial stages of reasoning, they struggled to re-incorporate earlier information, underscoring the challenges of multi-hop reasoning within transformer architectures. This suggests that aligning the sequence of modalities with the logical flow of reasoning steps is more critical than modality order alone. These insights offer valuable implications for improving multi-modal prompt design, with broader applications across fields such as education, medical imaging, and cross-modal learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ippei Fujisawa, Sensho Nobe, Hiroki Seto, Rina Onda, Yoshiaki Uchida, Hiroki Ikoma, Pei-Chun Chien, Ryota Kanai</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is central to a wide range of intellectual activities, and while the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their performance in reasoning tasks remains limited. The processes and mechanisms underlying reasoning are not yet fully understood, but key elements include path exploration, selection of relevant knowledge, and multi-step inference. Problems are solved through the synthesis of these components. In this paper, we propose a benchmark that focuses on a specific aspect of reasoning ability: the direct evaluation of multi-step inference. To this end, we design a special reasoning task where multi-step inference is specifically focused by largely eliminating path exploration and implicit knowledge utilization. Our dataset comprises pairs of explicit instructions and corresponding questions, where the procedures necessary for solving the questions are entirely detailed within the instructions. This setup allows models to solve problems solely by following the provided directives. By constructing problems that require varying numbers of steps to solve and evaluating responses at each step, we enable a thorough assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to follow instructions. To ensure the robustness of our evaluation, we include multiple distinct tasks. Furthermore, by comparing accuracy across tasks, utilizing step-aware metrics, and applying separately defined measures of complexity, we conduct experiments that offer insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in reasoning tasks. Our findings have significant implications for the development of LLMs and highlight areas for future research in advancing their reasoning abilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhrij Patel, Souradip Chakraborty, Wesley A. Suttle, Mengdi Wang, Amrit Singh Bedi, Dinesh Manocha</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-based AI system optimization typically involves a feedback loop scheme where a single LLM generates an evaluation in natural language of the current output to improve the next iteration's output. However, in this work, we empirically demonstrate that for a practical and complex task (code generation) with multiple criteria to evaluate, utilizing only one LLM evaluator tends to let errors in generated code go undetected, thus leading to incorrect evaluations and ultimately suboptimal test case performance. Motivated by this failure case, we assume there exists an optimal evaluation policy that samples an evaluation between response and ground truth. We then theoretically prove that a linear combination of multiple evaluators can approximate this optimal policy. From this insight, we propose AI system optimization via Multiple LLM Evaluators (AIME). AIME is an evaluation protocol that utilizes multiple LLMs that each independently generate an evaluation on separate criteria and then combine them via concatenation. We provide an extensive empirical study showing AIME outperforming baseline methods in code generation tasks, with up to $62\%$ higher error detection rate and up to $16\%$ higher success rate than a single LLM evaluation protocol on LeetCodeHard and HumanEval datasets. We also show that the selection of the number of evaluators and which criteria to utilize is non-trivial as it can impact pact success rate by up to $12\%$.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03161">Adaptive Masking Enhances Visual Grounding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sen Jia, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, zero-shot and few-shot learning in visual grounding have garnered considerable attention, largely due to the success of large-scale vision-language pre-training on expansive datasets such as LAION-5B and DataComp-1B. However, the continuous expansion of these datasets presents significant challenges, particularly with respect to data availability and computational overhead, thus creating a bottleneck in the advancement of low-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose IMAGE, Interpretative MAsking with Gaussian radiation modEling, aimed at enhancing vocabulary grounding in low-shot learning scenarios without necessitating an increase in dataset size. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science and the recent success of masked autoencoders (MAE), our method leverages adaptive masking on salient regions of the feature maps generated by the vision backbone. This enables the model to learn robust, generalized representations through the reconstruction of occluded information, thereby facilitating effective attention to both local and global features. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on benchmark datasets, including COCO and ODinW, demonstrating its superior performance in zero-shot and few-shot tasks. Experimental results consistently show that IMAGE outperforms baseline models, achieving enhanced generalization and improved performance in low-shot scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of adaptive feature manipulation through attention mechanisms and Gaussian modeling as a promising alternative to approaches that rely on the continual scaling of dataset sizes for the advancement of zero-shot and few-shot learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elias Crum, Antonio De Santis, Manon Ovide, Jiaxin Pan, Alessia Pisu, Nicolas Lazzari, Sebastian Rudolph</p>
<p>Abstract: Ontologies often lack explicit disjointness declarations between classes, despite their usefulness for sophisticated reasoning and consistency checking in Knowledge Graphs. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich ontologies by identifying and asserting class disjointness axioms. Our approach aims at leveraging the implicit knowledge embedded in LLMs, using prompt engineering to elicit this knowledge for classifying ontological disjointness. We validate our methodology on the DBpedia ontology, focusing on open-source LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs, when guided by effective prompt strategies, can reliably identify disjoint class relationships, thus streamlining the process of ontology completion without extensive manual input. For comprehensive disjointness enrichment, we propose a process that takes logical relationships between disjointness and subclass statements into account in order to maintain satisfiability and reduce the number of calls to the LLM. This work provides a foundation for future applications of LLMs in automated ontology enhancement and offers insights into optimizing LLM performance through strategic prompt design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiran Busch, Henrik Leopold</p>
<p>Abstract: An increasing number of organizations are deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for a wide range of tasks. Despite their general utility, LLMs are prone to errors, ranging from inaccuracies to hallucinations. To objectively assess the capabilities of existing LLMs, performance benchmarks are conducted. However, these benchmarks often do not translate to more specific real-world tasks. This paper addresses the gap in benchmarking LLM performance in the Business Process Management (BPM) domain. Currently, no BPM-specific benchmarks exist, creating uncertainty about the suitability of different LLMs for BPM tasks. This paper systematically compares LLM performance on four BPM tasks focusing on small open-source models. The analysis aims to identify task-specific performance variations, compare the effectiveness of open-source versus commercial models, and assess the impact of model size on BPM task performance. This paper provides insights into the practical applications of LLMs in BPM, guiding organizations in selecting appropriate models for their specific needs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03446">On Uncertainty In Natural Language Processing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dennis Ulmer</p>
<p>Abstract: The last decade in deep learning has brought on increasingly capable systems that are deployed on a wide variety of applications. In natural language processing, the field has been transformed by a number of breakthroughs including large language models, which are used in increasingly many user-facing applications. In order to reap the benefits of this technology and reduce potential harms, it is important to quantify the reliability of model predictions and the uncertainties that shroud their development.
  This thesis studies how uncertainty in natural language processing can be characterized from a linguistic, statistical and neural perspective, and how it can be reduced and quantified through the design of the experimental pipeline. We further explore uncertainty quantification in modeling by theoretically and empirically investigating the effect of inductive model biases in text classification tasks. The corresponding experiments include data for three different languages (Danish, English and Finnish) and tasks as well as a large set of different uncertainty quantification approaches. Additionally, we propose a method for calibrated sampling in natural language generation based on non-exchangeable conformal prediction, which provides tighter token sets with better coverage of the actual continuation. Lastly, we develop an approach to quantify confidence in large black-box language models using auxiliary predictors, where the confidence is predicted from the input to and generated output text of the target model alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Hu, Liang Liu, Shu Yang, Xin Chen, Zhen Tan, Muhammad Asif Ali, Mengdi Li, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various tasks, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting emerging as a key technique to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, existing research primarily focuses on improving performance, lacking a comprehensive framework to explain and understand the fundamental factors behind CoT's success. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel perspective grounded in the Hopfieldian view of cognition in cognitive neuroscience. We establish a connection between CoT reasoning and key cognitive elements such as stimuli, actions, neural populations, and representation spaces. From our view, we can understand the reasoning process as the movement between these representation spaces. Building on this insight, we develop a method for localizing reasoning errors in the response of CoTs. Moreover, we propose the Representation-of-Thought (RoT) framework, which leverages the robustness of low-dimensional representation spaces to enhance the robustness of the reasoning process in CoTs. Experimental results demonstrate that RoT improves the robustness and interpretability of CoT reasoning while offering fine-grained control over the reasoning process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianpeng Chen, Yawen Ling, Yazhou Ren, Zichen Wen, Tianyi Wu, Shufei Zhang, Lifang He</p>
<p>Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of graph-structured data, multi-view graph clustering has been widely used in various downstream applications. Existing approaches primarily rely on a unified message passing mechanism, which significantly enhances clustering performance. Nevertheless, this mechanism limits its applicability to heterophilous situations, as it is fundamentally predicated on the assumption of homophily, i.e., the connected nodes often belong to the same class. In reality, this assumption does not always hold; a moderately or even mildly homophilous graph is more common than a fully homophilous one due to inevitable heterophilous information in the graph. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel SiMilarity-enhanced Homophily for Multi-view Heterophilous Graph Clustering (SMHGC) approach. By analyzing the relationship between similarity and graph homophily, we propose to enhance the homophily by introducing three similarity terms, i.e., neighbor pattern similarity, node feature similarity, and multi-view global similarity, in a label-free manner. Then, a consensus-based inter- and intra-view fusion paradigm is proposed to fuse the improved homophilous graph from different views and utilize them for clustering. The state-of-the-art experimental results on both multi-view heterophilous and homophilous datasets collectively demonstrate the strong capacity of similarity for unsupervised multi-view heterophilous graph learning. Additionally, the consistent performance across semi-synthetic datasets with varying levels of homophily serves as further evidence of SMHGC's resilience to heterophily.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03608">TICKing All the Boxes: Generated Checklists Improve LLM Evaluation and Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Cook, Tim Rockt\"aschel, Jakob Foerster, Dennis Aumiller, Alex Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Given the widespread adoption and usage of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to have flexible and interpretable evaluations of their instruction-following ability. Preference judgments between model outputs have become the de facto evaluation standard, despite distilling complex, multi-faceted preferences into a single ranking. Furthermore, as human annotation is slow and costly, LLMs are increasingly used to make these judgments, at the expense of reliability and interpretability. In this work, we propose TICK (Targeted Instruct-evaluation with ChecKlists), a fully automated, interpretable evaluation protocol that structures evaluations with LLM-generated, instruction-specific checklists. We first show that, given an instruction, LLMs can reliably produce high-quality, tailored evaluation checklists that decompose the instruction into a series of YES/NO questions. Each question asks whether a candidate response meets a specific requirement of the instruction. We demonstrate that using TICK leads to a significant increase (46.4% $\to$ 52.2%) in the frequency of exact agreements between LLM judgements and human preferences, as compared to having an LLM directly score an output. We then show that STICK (Self-TICK) can be used to improve generation quality across multiple benchmarks via self-refinement and Best-of-N selection. STICK self-refinement on LiveBench reasoning tasks leads to an absolute gain of $+$7.8%, whilst Best-of-N selection with STICK attains $+$6.3% absolute improvement on the real-world instruction dataset, WildBench. In light of this, structured, multi-faceted self-improvement is shown to be a promising way to further advance LLM capabilities. Finally, by providing LLM-generated checklists to human evaluators tasked with directly scoring LLM responses to WildBench instructions, we notably increase inter-annotator agreement (0.194 $\to$ 0.256).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin Chen, Kaijing Ma, Haojian Huang, Jiayu Shen, Han Fang, Xianghao Zang, Chao Ban, Zhongjiang He, Hao Sun, Yanmei Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of multi-modal models has been rapidly advancing, with some demonstrating remarkable capabilities. However, annotating video-text pairs remains expensive and insufficient. Take video question answering (VideoQA) tasks as an example, human annotated questions and answers often cover only part of the video, and similar semantics can also be expressed through different text forms, leading to underutilization of video. To address this, we propose BoViLA, a self-training framework that augments question samples during training through LLM-based self-questioning and answering, which help model exploit video information and the internal knowledge of LLMs more thoroughly to improve modality alignment. To filter bad self-generated questions, we introduce Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to estimate uncertainty and assess the quality of self-generated questions by evaluating the modality alignment within the context. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore LLM-based self-training frameworks for modality alignment. We evaluate BoViLA on five strong VideoQA benchmarks, where it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. Additionally, we provide extensive analyses of the self-training framework and the EDL-based uncertainty filtering mechanism.

<p>Abstract: The article proposes a method for forming a dedicated operational context in course of development and implementation of autonomous corporate management systems based on example of autonomous systems for a board of directors. The significant part of the operational context for autonomous company management systems is the regulatory and legal environment within which corporations operate. In order to create a special operational context for autonomous artificial intelligence systems, the wording of local regulatory documents can be simultaneously presented in two versions: for use by people and for use by autonomous systems. In this case, the artificial intelligence system will get a well-defined operational context that allows such a system to perform functions within the required standards. Local regulations that provide for the specifics of the joint work of individuals and autonomous artificial intelligence systems can create the basis of the relevant legislation governing the development and implementation of autonomous systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shokooh Khandan</p>
<p>Abstract: Hand gesture recognition systems have yielded many exciting advancements in the last decade and become more popular in HCI (human-computer interaction) with several application areas, which spans from safety and security applications to automotive field. Various deep neural network architectures have already been inspected for hand gesture recognition systems, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and a cascade of the last two architectures known as CNN-RNN. However, a major problem still exists, which is most of the existing ML algorithms are designed and developed the building blocks and techniques for real-valued (RV). Researchers applied various RV techniques on the complex-valued (CV) radar images, such as converting a CV optimisation problem into a RV one, by splitting the complex numbers into their real and imaginary parts. However, the major disadvantage of this method is that the resulting algorithm will double the network dimensions. Recent work on RNNs and other fundamental theoretical analysis suggest that CV numbers have a richer representational capacity, but due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models, the performance of CV networks are marginalised. In this report, we propose a fully CV-CNN, including all building blocks, forward and backward operations, and derivatives all in complex domain. We explore our proposed classification model on two sets of CV hand gesture radar images in comparison with the equivalent RV model. In chapter five, we propose a CV-forward residual network, for the purpose of binary classification of the two sets of CV hand gesture radar datasets and compare its performance with our proposed CV-CNN and a baseline CV-forward CNN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Lan, Diego Frassinelli, Barbara Plank</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models frequently struggle to accurately predict responses provided by multiple human annotators, particularly when those responses exhibit human uncertainty. In this study, we focus on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, and we comprehensively evaluate how well the state-of-the-art vision-language models correlate with the distribution of human responses. To do so, we categorize our samples based on their levels (low, medium, high) of human uncertainty in disagreement (HUD) and employ not only accuracy but also three new human-correlated metrics in VQA, to investigate the impact of HUD. To better align models with humans, we also verify the effect of common calibration and human calibration. Our results show that even BEiT3, currently the best model for this task, struggles to capture the multi-label distribution inherent in diverse human responses. Additionally, we observe that the commonly used accuracy-oriented calibration technique adversely affects BEiT3's ability to capture HUD, further widening the gap between model predictions and human distributions. In contrast, we show the benefits of calibrating models towards human distributions for VQA, better aligning model confidence with human uncertainty. Our findings highlight that for VQA, the consistent alignment between human responses and model predictions is understudied and should become the next crucial target of future studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro Herrero-Vidal, You-Lin Chen, Cris Liu, Prithviraj Sen, Lichao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce VARM, variant relationship matcher strategy, to identify pairs of variant products in e-commerce catalogs. Traditional definitions of entity resolution are concerned with whether product mentions refer to the same underlying product. However, this fails to capture product relationships that are critical for e-commerce applications, such as having similar, but not identical, products listed on the same webpage or share reviews. Here, we formulate a new type of entity resolution in variant product relationships to capture these similar e-commerce product links. In contrast with the traditional definition, the new definition requires both identifying if two products are variant matches of each other and what are the attributes that vary between them. To satisfy these two requirements, we developed a strategy that leverages the strengths of both encoding and generative AI models. First, we construct a dataset that captures webpage product links, and therefore variant product relationships, to train an encoding LLM to predict variant matches for any given pair of products. Second, we use RAG prompted generative LLMs to extract variation and common attributes amongst groups of variant products. To validate our strategy, we evaluated model performance using real data from one of the world's leading e-commerce retailers. The results showed that our strategy outperforms alternative solutions and paves the way to exploiting these new type of product relationships.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eleonora Lopez, Luigi Sigillo, Federica Colonnese, Massimo Panella, Danilo Comminiello</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating images from brain waves is gaining increasing attention due to its potential to advance brain-computer interface (BCI) systems by understanding how brain signals encode visual cues. Most of the literature has focused on fMRI-to-Image tasks as fMRI is characterized by high spatial resolution. However, fMRI is an expensive neuroimaging modality and does not allow for real-time BCI. On the other hand, electroencephalography (EEG) is a low-cost, non-invasive, and portable neuroimaging technique, making it an attractive option for future real-time applications. Nevertheless, EEG presents inherent challenges due to its low spatial resolution and susceptibility to noise and artifacts, which makes generating images from EEG more difficult. In this paper, we address these problems with a streamlined framework based on the ControlNet adapter for conditioning a latent diffusion model (LDM) through EEG signals. We conduct experiments and ablation studies on popular benchmarks to demonstrate that the proposed method beats other state-of-the-art models. Unlike these methods, which often require extensive preprocessing, pretraining, different losses, and captioning models, our approach is efficient and straightforward, requiring only minimal preprocessing and a few components. Code will be available after publication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Access to mental health support remains limited, particularly in marginalized communities where structural and cultural barriers hinder timely care. This paper explores the potential of AI-enabled chatbots as a scalable solution, focusing on advanced large language models (LLMs)-GPT v4, Mistral Large, and LLama V3.1-and assessing their ability to deliver empathetic, meaningful responses in mental health contexts. While these models show promise in generating structured responses, they fall short in replicating the emotional depth and adaptability of human therapists. Additionally, trustworthiness, bias, and privacy challenges persist due to unreliable datasets and limited collaboration with mental health professionals. To address these limitations, we propose a federated learning framework that ensures data privacy, reduces bias, and integrates continuous validation from clinicians to enhance response quality. This approach aims to develop a secure, evidence-based AI chatbot capable of offering trustworthy, empathetic, and bias-reduced mental health support, advancing AI's role in digital mental health care.</p>

<p>Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous across all kinds of objects, whether in nature or in man-made creations. While these symmetries may seem intuitive to the human eye, detecting them with a machine is nontrivial due to the vast search space. Classical geometry-based methods work by aggregating "votes" for each symmetry but struggle with noise. In contrast, learning-based methods may be more robust to noise, but often overlook partial symmetries due to the scarcity of annotated data. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a novel symmetry detection method that marries classical symmetry detection techniques with recent advances in generative modeling. Specifically, we apply Langevin dynamics to a redefined symmetry space to enhance robustness against noise. We provide empirical results on a variety of shapes that suggest our method is not only robust to noise, but can also identify both partial and global symmetries. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our detected symmetries in various downstream tasks, such as compression and symmetrization of noisy shapes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zecheng Yin, Chonghao Cheng,  Lizhen</p>
<p>Abstract: Navigating towards fully open language goals and exploring open scenes in a manner akin to human exploration have always posed significant challenges. Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning with both language and visual data. While many works have focused on leveraging VLMs for navigation in open scenes and with open vocabularies, these efforts often fall short of fully utilizing the potential of VLMs or require substantial computational resources. We introduce Navigation with VLM (NavVLM), a framework that harnesses equipment-level VLMs to enable agents to navigate towards any language goal specific or non-specific in open scenes, emulating human exploration behaviors without any prior training. The agent leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information based on any language goal and constantly provides exploration guidance during navigation until it reaches the target location or area. Our framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) in traditional specific goal settings but also extends the navigation capabilities to any open-set language goal. We evaluate NavVLM in richly detailed environments from the Matterport 3D (MP3D), Habitat Matterport 3D (HM3D), and Gibson datasets within the Habitat simulator. With the power of VLMs, navigation has entered a new era.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence enables smarter control in building automation by its learning capability of users' preferences on facility control. Reinforcement learning (RL) was one of the approaches to this, but it has many challenges in real-world implementations. We propose a new architecture for logic-free building automation (LFBA) that leverages deep learning (DL) to control room facilities without predefined logic. Our approach differs from RL in that it uses wall switches as supervised signals and a ceiling camera to monitor the environment, allowing the DL model to learn users' preferred controls directly from the scenes and switch states. This LFBA system is tested by our testbed with various conditions and user activities. The results demonstrate the efficacy, achieving 93%-98% control accuracy with VGG, outperforming other DL models such as Vision Transformer and ResNet. This indicates that LFBA can achieve smarter and more user-friendly control by learning from the observable scenes and user interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although recommenders can ship items to users automatically based on the users' preferences, they often cause unfairness to groups or individuals. For instance, when users can be divided into two groups according to a sensitive social attribute and there is a significant difference in terms of activity between the two groups, the learned recommendation algorithm will result in a recommendation gap between the two groups, which causes group unfairness. In this work, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm named Diffusion-based Fair Recommender (DifFaiRec) to provide fair recommendations. DifFaiRec is built upon the conditional diffusion model and hence has a strong ability to learn the distribution of user preferences from their ratings on items and is able to generate diverse recommendations effectively. To guarantee fairness, we design a counterfactual module to reduce the model sensitivity to protected attributes and provide mathematical explanations. The experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DifFaiRec over competitive baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuding Yang, Shengyao Lu, Weidong Guo, Xiangyang Li, Kaitong Yang, Yu Xu, Di Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require precise alignment with complex instructions to optimize their performance in real-world applications. As the demand for refined instruction tuning data increases, traditional methods that evolve simple seed instructions often struggle to effectively enhance complexity or manage difficulty scaling across various domains. Our innovative approach, Task-Centered Instruction Evolution (TaCIE), addresses these shortcomings by redefining instruction evolution from merely evolving seed instructions to a more dynamic and comprehensive combination of elements. TaCIE starts by deconstructing complex instructions into their fundamental components. It then generates and integrates new elements with the original ones, reassembling them into more sophisticated instructions that progressively increase in difficulty, diversity, and complexity. Applied across multiple domains, LLMs fine-tuned with these evolved instructions have substantially outperformed those tuned with conventional methods, marking a significant advancement in instruction-based model fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vivek Ganesh Sonar, Muhammad Tanveer Jan, Mike Wells, Abhijit Pandya, Gabriela Engstrom, Richard Shih, Borko Furht</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate body weight estimation is critical in emergency medicine for proper dosing of weight-based medications, yet direct measurement is often impractical in urgent situations. This paper presents a non-invasive method for estimating body weight by calculating total body volume and height using 3D imaging technology. A RealSense D415 camera is employed to capture high-resolution depth maps of the patient, from which 3D models are generated. The Convex Hull Algorithm is then applied to calculate the total body volume, with enhanced accuracy achieved by segmenting the point cloud data into multiple sections and summing their individual volumes. The height is derived from the 3D model by identifying the distance between key points on the body. This combined approach provides an accurate estimate of body weight, improving the reliability of medical interventions where precise weight data is unavailable. The proposed method demonstrates significant potential to enhance patient safety and treatment outcomes in emergency settings.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02804">Leveraging Retrieval Augment Approach for Multimodal Emotion Recognition Under Missing Modalities</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Fan, Hongyu Yuan, Haolin Zuo, Rui Liu, Guanglai Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition utilizes complete multimodal information and robust multimodal joint representation to gain high performance. However, the ideal condition of full modality integrity is often not applicable in reality and there always appears the situation that some modalities are missing. For example, video, audio, or text data is missing due to sensor failure or network bandwidth problems, which presents a great challenge to MER research. Traditional methods extract useful information from the complete modalities and reconstruct the missing modalities to learn robust multimodal joint representation. These methods have laid a solid foundation for research in this field, and to a certain extent, alleviated the difficulty of multimodal emotion recognition under missing modalities. However, relying solely on internal reconstruction and multimodal joint learning has its limitations, especially when the missing information is critical for emotion recognition. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework of Retrieval Augment for Missing Modality Multimodal Emotion Recognition (RAMER), which introduces similar multimodal emotion data to enhance the performance of emotion recognition under missing modalities. By leveraging databases, that contain related multimodal emotion data, we can retrieve similar multimodal emotion information to fill in the gaps left by missing modalities. Various experimental results demonstrate that our framework is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches in missing modality MER tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hassan Gharoun, Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi, Fang Chen, Amir H. Gandomi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents an uncertainty-aware stacked neural networks model for the reliable classification of COVID-19 from radiological images. The model addresses the critical gap in uncertainty-aware modeling by focusing on accurately identifying confidently correct predictions while alerting users to confidently incorrect and uncertain predictions, which can promote trust in automated systems. The architecture integrates uncertainty quantification methods, including Monte Carlo dropout and ensemble techniques, to enhance predictive reliability by assessing the certainty of diagnostic predictions. Within a two-tier model framework, the tier one model generates initial predictions and associated uncertainties, which the second tier model uses to produce a trust indicator alongside the diagnostic outcome. This dual-output model not only predicts COVID-19 cases but also provides a trust flag, indicating the reliability of each diagnosis and aiming to minimize the need for retesting and expert verification. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on the COVIDx CXR-4 dataset, showing a novel approach in identifying and handling confidently incorrect cases and uncertain cases, thus enhancing the trustworthiness of automated diagnostics in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahad{\i}r Ery{\i}lmaz, Osman Alperen Kora\c{s}, J\"org Schl\"otterer, Christin Seifert</p>
<p>Abstract: Reproducibility is essential for scientific research. However, in computer vision, achieving consistent results is challenging due to various factors. One influential, yet often unrecognized, factor is CUDA-induced randomness. Despite CUDA's advantages for accelerating algorithm execution on GPUs, if not controlled, its behavior across multiple executions remains non-deterministic. While reproducibility issues in ML being researched, the implications of CUDA-induced randomness in application are yet to be understood. Our investigation focuses on this randomness across one standard benchmark dataset and two real-world datasets in an isolated environment. Our results show that CUDA-induced randomness can account for differences up to 4.77% in performance scores. We find that managing this variability for reproducibility may entail increased runtime or reduce performance, but that disadvantages are not as significant as reported in previous studies.</p>

<p>Abstract: For the last three years, the AutoPET competition gathered the medical imaging community around a hot topic: lesion segmentation on Positron Emitting Tomography (PET) scans. Each year a different aspect of the problem is presented; in 2024 the multiplicity of existing and used tracers was at the core of the challenge. Specifically, this year's edition aims to develop a fully automatic algorithm capable of performing lesion segmentation on a PET/CT scan, without knowing the tracer, which can either be a FDG or PSMA-based tracer. In this paper we describe how we used the nnUNetv2 framework to train two sets of 6 fold ensembles of models to perform fully automatic PET/CT lesion segmentation as well as a MIP-CNN to choose which set of models to use for segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihao Zhao, Yinzheng Zhao, Junjie Yang, Kai Huang, Nassir Navab, M. Ali Nasseri</p>
<p>Abstract: AI-based vascular segmentation is becoming increasingly common in enhancing the screening and treatment of ophthalmic diseases. Deep learning structures based on U-Net have achieved relatively good performance in vascular segmentation. However, small blood vessels and capillaries tend to be lost during segmentation when passed through the traditional U-Net downsampling module. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel Kalman filter based Linear Deformable Diffusion (KLDD) model for retinal vessel segmentation. Our model employs a diffusion process that iteratively refines the segmentation, leveraging the flexible receptive fields of deformable convolutions in feature extraction modules to adapt to the detailed tubular vascular structures. More specifically, we first employ a feature extractor with linear deformable convolution to capture vascular structure information form the input images. To better optimize the coordinate positions of deformable convolution, we employ the Kalman filter to enhance the perception of vascular structures in linear deformable convolution. Subsequently, the features of the vascular structures extracted are utilized as a conditioning element within a diffusion model by the Cross-Attention Aggregation module (CAAM) and the Channel-wise Soft Attention module (CSAM). These aggregations are designed to enhance the diffusion model's capability to generate vascular structures. Experiments are evaluated on retinal fundus image datasets (DRIVE, CHASE_DB1) as well as the 3mm and 6mm of the OCTA-500 dataset, and the results show that the diffusion model proposed in this paper outperforms other methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxing Zhang, Siyuan Meng, Chunchun Chen, Mengyao Peng, Hongyan Gu, Xinli Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks(GNNs) have a wide range of applications in multimedia.Recent studies have shown that Graph neural networks(GNNs) are vulnerable to link stealing attacks,which infers the existence of edges in the target GNN's training graph.Existing attacks are usually based on the assumption that links exist between two nodes that share similar posteriors;however,they fail to focus on links that do not hold under this assumption.To this end,we propose LinkThief,an improved link stealing attack that combines generalized structure knowledge with node similarity,in a scenario where the attackers' background knowledge contains partially leaked target graph and shadow graph.Specifically,to equip the attack model with insights into the link structure spanning both the shadow graph and the target graph,we introduce the idea of creating a Shadow-Target Bridge Graph and extracting edge subgraph structure features from it.Through theoretical analysis from the perspective of privacy theft,we first explore how to implement the aforementioned ideas.Building upon the findings,we design the Bridge Graph Generator to construct the Shadow-Target Bridge Graph.Then,the subgraph around the link is sampled by the Edge Subgraph Preparation Module.Finally,the Edge Structure Feature Extractor is designed to obtain generalized structure knowledge,which is combined with node similarity to form the features provided to the attack model.Extensive experiments validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and demonstrate that LinkThief still effectively steals links without extra assumptions.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection method for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the presence of recent actual UAV intrusion dataset.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose such the autoencoder-based machine learning intrusion detection method for UAVs using actual dataset, while most of existing works only consider either simulated datasets or datasets irrelevant to UAV communications. Our experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines such as feature selection schemes in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. The increase in computational power and data availability has led to a proliferation of both single- and multi-modal models. As the GenAI ecosystem matures, the need for extensible and model-agnostic risk identification frameworks is growing. To meet this need, we introduce the Python Risk Identification Toolkit (PyRIT), an open-source framework designed to enhance red teaming efforts in GenAI systems. PyRIT is a model- and platform-agnostic tool that enables red teamers to probe for and identify novel harms, risks, and jailbreaks in multimodal generative AI models. Its composable architecture facilitates the reuse of core building blocks and allows for extensibility to future models and modalities. This paper details the challenges specific to red teaming generative AI systems, the development and features of PyRIT, and its practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Liu, Xiaoxin He, Miao Xiong, Jinlan Fu, Shumin Deng, Bryan Hooi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a simple yet effective jailbreak attack named FlipAttack against black-box LLMs. First, from the autoregressive nature, we reveal that LLMs tend to understand the text from left to right and find that they struggle to comprehend the text when noise is added to the left side. Motivated by these insights, we propose to disguise the harmful prompt by constructing left-side noise merely based on the prompt itself, then generalize this idea to 4 flipping modes. Second, we verify the strong ability of LLMs to perform the text-flipping task, and then develop 4 variants to guide LLMs to denoise, understand, and execute harmful behaviors accurately. These designs keep FlipAttack universal, stealthy, and simple, allowing it to jailbreak black-box LLMs within only 1 query. Experiments on 8 LLMs demonstrate the superiority of FlipAttack. Remarkably, it achieves $\sim$98\% attack success rate on GPT-4o, and $\sim$98\% bypass rate against 5 guardrail models on average.

<p>Abstract: Many successful methods to learn dynamical systems from data have recently been introduced. Such methods often rely on the availability of the system's full state. However, this underlying hypothesis is rather restrictive as it is typically not confirmed in practice, leaving us with partially observed systems. Utilizing the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism from statistical physics, we demonstrate that Constant Lag Neural Delay Differential Equations (NDDEs) naturally serve as suitable models for partially observed states. In empirical evaluation, we show that such models outperform existing methods on both synthetic and experimental data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The study of cause-and-effect is of the utmost importance in many branches of science, but also for many practical applications of intelligent systems. In particular, identifying causal relationships in situations that include hidden factors is a major challenge for methods that rely solely on observational data for building causal models. This paper proposes CAnDOIT, a causal discovery method to reconstruct causal models using both observational and interventional time-series data. The use of interventional data in the causal analysis is crucial for real-world applications, such as robotics, where the scenario is highly complex and observational data alone are often insufficient to uncover the correct causal structure. Validation of the method is performed initially on randomly generated synthetic models and subsequently on a well-known benchmark for causal structure learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can effectively handle data from interventions and exploit them to enhance the accuracy of the causal analysis. A Python implementation of CAnDOIT has also been developed and is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/lcastri/causalflow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minh Duong Nguyen, Khanh Le, Khoi Do, Nguyen H. Tran, Duc Nguyen, Chien Trinh, Zhaohui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In personalized Federated Learning (pFL), high data heterogeneity can cause significant gradient divergence across devices, adversely affecting the learning process. This divergence, especially when gradients from different users form an obtuse angle during aggregation, can negate progress, leading to severe weight and gradient update degradation. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach to pFL design, namely Federated Learning with Layer-wise Aggregation via Gradient Analysis (FedLAG), utilizing the concept of gradient conflict at the layer level. Specifically, when layer-wise gradients of different clients form acute angles, those gradients align in the same direction, enabling updates across different clients toward identifying client-invariant features. Conversely, when layer-wise gradient pairs make create obtuse angles, the layers tend to focus on client-specific tasks. In hindsights, FedLAG assigns layers for personalization based on the extent of layer-wise gradient conflicts. Specifically, layers with gradient conflicts are excluded from the global aggregation process. The theoretical evaluation demonstrates that when integrated into other pFL baselines, FedLAG enhances pFL performance by a certain margin. Therefore, our proposed method achieves superior convergence behavior compared with other baselines. Extensive experiments show that our FedLAG outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be easily incorporated with many existing methods to further enhance performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics are essential for deciphering protein functional mechanisms and developing molecular therapies. However, the complex high-dimensional dynamics and interatomic interactions of biological processes pose significant challenge for existing computational techniques. In this paper, we approach this problem for the first time by introducing Deep Signature, a novel computationally tractable framework that characterizes complex dynamics and interatomic interactions based on their evolving trajectories. Specifically, our approach incorporates soft spectral clustering that locally aggregates cooperative dynamics to reduce the size of the system, as well as signature transform that collects iterated integrals to provide a global characterization of the non-smooth interactive dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Deep Signature exhibits several desirable properties, including invariance to translation, near invariance to rotation, equivariance to permutation of atomic coordinates, and invariance under time reparameterization. Furthermore, experimental results on three benchmarks of biological processes verify that our approach can achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) increasingly becoming important components of news recommender systems, employing LLMs in such systems introduces new risks, such as the influence of cognitive biases in LLMs. Cognitive biases refer to systematic patterns of deviation from norms or rationality in the judgment process, which can result in inaccurate outputs from LLMs, thus threatening the reliability of news recommender systems. Specifically, LLM-based news recommender systems affected by cognitive biases could lead to the propagation of misinformation, reinforcement of stereotypes, and the formation of echo chambers. In this paper, we explore the potential impact of multiple cognitive biases on LLM-based news recommender systems, including anchoring bias, framing bias, status quo bias and group attribution bias. Furthermore, to facilitate future research at improving the reliability of LLM-based news recommender systems, we discuss strategies to mitigate these biases through data augmentation, prompt engineering and learning algorithms aspects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Wu, Patrick Fernandes, Amanda Bertsch, Seungone Kim, Sina Pakazad, Graham Neubig</p>
<p>Abstract: General-purpose LLM judges capable of human-level evaluation provide not only a scalable and accurate way of evaluating instruction-following LLMs but also new avenues for supervising and improving their performance. One promising way of leveraging LLM judges for supervision is through Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which uses a reference-based evaluator to select a high-quality output from amongst a set of candidate outputs. In the first part of this work, we explore using MBR decoding as a method for improving the test-time performance of instruction-following LLMs. We find that MBR decoding with reference-based LLM judges substantially improves over greedy decoding, best-of-N decoding with reference-free judges and MBR decoding with lexical and embedding-based metrics on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench. These gains are consistent across LLMs with up to 70B parameters, demonstrating that smaller LLM judges can be used to supervise much larger LLMs. Then, seeking to retain the improvements from MBR decoding while mitigating additional test-time costs, we explore iterative self-training on MBR-decoded outputs. We find that self-training using Direct Preference Optimisation leads to significant performance gains, such that the self-trained models with greedy decoding generally match and sometimes exceed the performance of their base models with MBR decoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern of large language models (LLMs) in their open deployment. To this end, safeguard methods aim to enforce the ethical and responsible use of LLMs through safety alignment or guardrail mechanisms. However, we found that the malicious attackers could exploit false positives of safeguards, i.e., fooling the safeguard model to block safe content mistakenly, leading to a new denial-of-service (DoS) attack on LLMs. Specifically, by software or phishing attacks on user client software, attackers insert a short, seemingly innocuous adversarial prompt into to user prompt templates in configuration files; thus, this prompt appears in final user requests without visibility in the user interface and is not trivial to identify. By designing an optimization process that utilizes gradient and attention information, our attack can automatically generate seemingly safe adversarial prompts, approximately only 30 characters long, that universally block over 97\% of user requests on Llama Guard 3. The attack presents a new dimension of evaluating LLM safeguards focusing on false positives, fundamentally different from the classic jailbreak.</p>

This paper presents a novel method for minimizing the number of samples required for high quality BRDF capture using a gonio-reflectometer setup. Taking an image of the physical material sample as input a lightweight neural network first estimates the parameters of an analytic BRDF model, and the distribution of the sample locations. In a second step we use an image based loss to find the number of samples required to meet the accuracy required. This approach significantly accelerates the measurement process while maintaining a high level of accuracy and fidelity in the BRDF representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Finite symmetric groups $S_n$ are essential in fields such as combinatorics, physics, and chemistry. However, learning a probability distribution over $S_n$ poses significant challenges due to its intractable size and discrete nature. In this paper, we introduce SymmetricDiffusers, a novel discrete diffusion model that simplifies the task of learning a complicated distribution over $S_n$ by decomposing it into learning simpler transitions of the reverse diffusion using deep neural networks. We identify the riffle shuffle as an effective forward transition and provide empirical guidelines for selecting the diffusion length based on the theory of random walks on finite groups. Additionally, we propose a generalized Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution for the reverse transition, which is provably more expressive than the PL distribution. We further introduce a theoretically grounded "denoising schedule" to improve sampling and learning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performances on solving tasks including sorting 4-digit MNIST images, jigsaw puzzles, and traveling salesman problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenxiao Fu, Fan Chen, Shan Zhou, Haitong Li, Lei Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Throughout its lifecycle, a large language model (LLM) generates a substantially larger carbon footprint during inference than training. LLM inference requests vary in batch size, prompt length, and token generation number, while cloud providers employ different GPU types and quantities to meet diverse service-level objectives for accuracy and latency. It is crucial for both users and cloud providers to have a tool that quickly and accurately estimates the carbon impact of LLM inferences based on a combination of inference request and hardware configurations before execution. Estimating the carbon footprint of LLM inferences is more complex than training due to lower and highly variable model FLOPS utilization, rendering previous equation-based models inaccurate. Additionally, existing machine learning (ML) prediction methods either lack accuracy or demand extensive training data, as they inadequately handle the distinct prefill and decode phases, overlook hardware-specific features, and inefficiently sample uncommon inference configurations. We introduce \coo, a graph neural network (GNN)-based model that greatly improves the accuracy of LLM inference carbon footprint predictions compared to previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oren Sultan, Alex Khasin, Guy Shiran, Asnat Greenstein-Messica, Dafna Shahaf</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a practical distillation approach to fine-tune LLMs for invoking tools in real-time applications. We focus on visual editing tasks; specifically, we modify images and videos by interpreting user stylistic requests, specified in natural language ("golden hour"), using an LLM to select the appropriate tools and their parameters to achieve the desired visual effect. We found that proprietary LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo show potential in this task, but their high cost and latency make them unsuitable for real-time applications. In our approach, we fine-tune a (smaller) student LLM with guidance from a (larger) teacher LLM and behavioral signals. We introduce offline metrics to evaluate student LLMs. Both online and offline experiments show that our student models manage to match the performance of our teacher model (GPT-3.5-Turbo), significantly reducing costs and latency. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning was improved by 25% in low-data regimes using augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patara Trirat, Wonyong Jeong, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) accelerates AI development by automating tasks in the development pipeline, such as optimal model search and hyperparameter tuning. Existing AutoML systems often require technical expertise to set up complex tools, which is in general time-consuming and requires a large amount of human effort. Therefore, recent works have started exploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen such burden and increase the usability of AutoML frameworks via a natural language interface, allowing non-expert users to build their data-driven solutions. These methods, however, are usually designed only for a particular process in the AI development pipeline and do not efficiently use the inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper proposes AutoML-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from data retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-Agent takes user's task descriptions, facilitates collaboration between specialized LLM agents, and delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike existing work, instead of devising a single plan, we introduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy to enhance exploration to search for more optimal plans. We also decompose each plan into sub-tasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network design) each of which is solved by a specialized agent we build via prompting executing in parallel, making the search process more efficient. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage verification to verify executed results and guide the code generation LLM in implementing successful solutions. Extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks using fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent achieves a higher success rate in automating the full AutoML process, yielding systems with good performance throughout the diverse domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Player Experience Modelling (PEM) is the study of AI techniques applied to modelling a player's experience within a video game. PEM development can be labour-intensive, requiring expert hand-authoring or specialized data collection. In this work, we propose a novel PEM development approach, approximating player experience from gameplay video. We evaluate this approach predicting affect in the game Angry Birds via a human subject study. We validate that our PEM can strongly correlate with self-reported and sensor measures of affect, demonstrating the potential of this approach.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02970">F-Fidelity: A Robust Framework for Faithfulness Evaluation of Explainable AI</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Zheng, Farhad Shirani, Zhuomin Chen, Chaohao Lin, Wei Cheng, Wenbo Guo, Dongsheng Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has developed a number of eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques. Although extracting meaningful insights from deep learning models, how to properly evaluate these XAI methods remains an open problem. The most widely used approach is to perturb or even remove what the XAI method considers to be the most important features in an input and observe the changes in the output prediction. This approach although efficient suffers the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem as the perturbed samples may no longer follow the original data distribution. A recent method RemOve And Retrain (ROAR) solves the OOD issue by retraining the model with perturbed samples guided by explanations. However, the training may not always converge given the distribution difference. Furthermore, using the model retrained based on XAI methods to evaluate these explainers may cause information leakage and thus lead to unfair comparisons. We propose Fine-tuned Fidelity F-Fidelity, a robust evaluation framework for XAI, which utilizes i) an explanation-agnostic fine-tuning strategy, thus mitigating the information leakage issue and ii) a random masking operation that ensures that the removal step does not generate an OOD input. We designed controlled experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainers and their degraded version to verify the correctness of our framework. We conducted experiments on multiple data structures, such as images, time series, and natural language. The results demonstrate that F-Fidelity significantly improves upon prior evaluation metrics in recovering the ground-truth ranking of the explainers. Furthermore, we show both theoretically and empirically that, given a faithful explainer, F-Fidelity metric can be used to compute the sparsity of influential input components, i.e., to extract the true explanation size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soroush Ebadian, Rupert Freeman, Nisarg Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Envy-freeness has become the cornerstone of fair division research. In settings where each individual is allocated a disjoint share of collective resources, it is a compelling fairness axiom which demands that no individual strictly prefer the allocation of another individual to their own. Unfortunately, in many real-life collective decision-making problems, the goal is to choose a (common) public outcome that is equally applicable to all individuals, and the notion of envy becomes vacuous. Consequently, this literature has avoided studying fairness criteria that focus on individuals feeling a sense of jealousy or resentment towards other individuals (rather than towards the system), missing out on a key aspect of fairness.
  In this work, we propose a novel fairness criterion, individual harm ratio, which is inspired by envy-freeness but applies to a broad range of collective decision-making settings. Theoretically, we identify minimal conditions under which this criterion and its groupwise extensions can be guaranteed, and study the computational complexity of related problems. Empirically, we conduct experiments with real data to show that our fairness criterion is powerful enough to differentiate between prominent decision-making algorithms for a range of tasks from voting and fair division to participatory budgeting and peer review.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mohammadi, Martijn Wieling, Michel Vols</p>
<p>Abstract: Case law is instrumental in shaping our understanding of human rights, including the right to adequate housing. The HUDOC database provides access to the textual content of case law from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), along with some metadata. While this metadata includes valuable information, such as the application number and the articles addressed in a case, it often lacks detailed substantive insights, such as the specific issues a case covers. This underscores the need for detailed analysis to extract such information. However, given the size of the database - containing over 40,000 cases - an automated solution is essential.
  In this study, we focus on the right to adequate housing and aim to build models to detect cases related to housing and eviction issues. Our experiments show that the resulting models not only provide performance comparable to more sophisticated approaches but are also interpretable, offering explanations for their decisions by highlighting the most influential words. The application of these models led to the identification of new cases that were initially overlooked during data collection. This suggests that NLP approaches can be effectively applied to categorise case law based on the specific issues they address.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> George Wang, Jesse Hoogland, Stan van Wingerden, Zach Furman, Daniel Murfet</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce refined variants of the Local Learning Coefficient (LLC), a measure of model complexity grounded in singular learning theory, to study the development of internal structure in transformer language models during training. By applying these \textit{refined LLCs} (rLLCs) to individual components of a two-layer attention-only transformer, we gain novel insights into the progressive differentiation and specialization of attention heads. Our methodology reveals how attention heads differentiate into distinct functional roles over the course of training, analyzes the types of data these heads specialize to process, and discovers a previously unidentified multigram circuit. These findings demonstrate that rLLCs provide a principled, quantitative toolkit for \textit{developmental interpretability}, which aims to understand models through their evolution across the learning process. More broadly, this work takes a step towards establishing the correspondence between data distributional structure, geometric properties of the loss landscape, learning dynamics, and emergent computational structures in neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengzhi Yang, Xinyu Wang, Ruipeng Zhang, Cong Wang, Frans Oliehoek, Jens Kober</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world environments require robots to continuously acquire new skills while retaining previously learned abilities, all without the need for clearly defined task boundaries. Storing all past data to prevent forgetting is impractical due to storage and privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a method that efficiently restores a robot's proficiency in previously learned tasks over its lifespan. Using an Episodic Memory (EM), our approach enables experience replay during training and retrieval during testing for local fine-tuning, allowing rapid adaptation to previously encountered problems without explicit task identifiers. Additionally, we introduce a selective weighting mechanism that emphasizes the most challenging segments of retrieved demonstrations, focusing local adaptation where it is most needed. This framework offers a scalable solution for lifelong learning in dynamic, task-unaware environments, combining retrieval-based adaptation with selective weighting to enhance robot performance in open-ended scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we aim to explore Multitask Speech Language Model (SpeechLM) efficient inference via token reduction. Unlike other modalities such as vision or text, speech has unique temporal dependencies, making previous efficient inference works on other modalities not directly applicable. Furthermore, methods for efficient SpeechLM inference on long sequence and sparse signals remain largely unexplored. Then we propose FastAdaSP, a weighted token merging framework specifically designed for various speech-related tasks to improve the trade-off between efficiency and performance. Experimental results on WavLLM and Qwen-Audio show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) efficiency-performance trade-off compared with other baseline methods. Specifically, FastAdaSP achieved 7x memory efficiency and 1.83x decoding throughput without any degradation on tasks like Emotion Recognition (ER) and Spoken Question Answering (SQA).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoming Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the transformative impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on teachers' roles and agencies in education, presenting a comprehensive framework that addresses teachers' perceptions, knowledge, acceptance, and practices of GenAI. As GenAI technologies, such as ChatGPT, become increasingly integrated into educational settings, teachers are required to adapt to evolving classroom dynamics, where AI plays a significant role in content creation, personalized learning, and student engagement. However, existing literature often treats these factors in isolation, overlooking how they collectively influence teachers' ability to effectively integrate GenAI into their pedagogical practices. This paper fills this gap by proposing a framework that categorizes teachers into four roles -- Observer, Adopter, Collaborator, and Innovator -- each representing different levels of GenAI engagement, outlining teachers' agencies in GenAI classrooms. By highlighting the need for continuous professional development and institutional support, we demonstrate how teachers can evolve from basic GenAI users to co-creators of knowledge alongside GenAI systems. The findings emphasize that for GenAI to reach its full educational potential, teachers must not only accept and understand its capabilities but also integrate it deeply into their teaching strategies. This study contributes to the growing literature on GenAI in education, offering practical implications for supporting teachers in navigating the complexities of GenAI adoption.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungduk Yu, Man Luo, Avinash Madasu, Vasudev Lal, Phillip Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer review is a critical process for ensuring the integrity of published scientific research. Confidence in this process is predicated on the assumption that experts in the relevant domain give careful consideration to the merits of manuscripts which are submitted for publication. With the recent rapid advancements in the linguistic capabilities of large language models (LLMs), a new potential risk to the peer review process is that negligent reviewers will rely on LLMs to perform the often time consuming process of reviewing a paper. In this study, we investigate the ability of existing AI text detection algorithms to distinguish between peer reviews written by humans and different state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that existing approaches fail to identify many GPT-4o written reviews without also producing a high number of false positive classifications. To address this deficiency, we propose a new detection approach which surpasses existing methods in the identification of GPT-4o written peer reviews at low levels of false positive classifications. Our work reveals the difficulty of accurately identifying AI-generated text at the individual review level, highlighting the urgent need for new tools and methods to detect this type of unethical application of generative AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Kollovieh, Marten Lienen, David L\"udke, Leo Schwinn, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling, particularly diffusion models, have opened new directions for time series modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance in forecasting and synthesis. However, the reliance of diffusion-based models on a simple, fixed prior complicates the generative process since the data and prior distributions differ significantly. We introduce TSFlow, a conditional flow matching (CFM) model for time series that simplifies the generative problem by combining Gaussian processes, optimal transport paths, and data-dependent prior distributions. By incorporating (conditional) Gaussian processes, TSFlow aligns the prior distribution more closely with the temporal structure of the data, enhancing both unconditional and conditional generation. Furthermore, we propose conditional prior sampling to enable probabilistic forecasting with an unconditionally trained model. In our experimental evaluation on eight real-world datasets, we demonstrate the generative capabilities of TSFlow, producing high-quality unconditional samples. Finally, we show that both conditionally and unconditionally trained models achieve competitive results in forecasting benchmarks, surpassing other methods on 6 out of 8 datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boqian Wu, Qiao Xiao, Shunxin Wang, Nicola Strisciuglio, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Maurice van Keulen, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Elena Mocanu</p>
<p>Abstract: It is generally perceived that Dynamic Sparse Training opens the door to a new era of scalability and efficiency for artificial neural networks at, perhaps, some costs in accuracy performance for the classification task. At the same time, Dense Training is widely accepted as being the "de facto" approach to train artificial neural networks if one would like to maximize their robustness against image corruption. In this paper, we question this general practice. Consequently, we claim that, contrary to what is commonly thought, the Dynamic Sparse Training methods can consistently outperform Dense Training in terms of robustness accuracy, particularly if the efficiency aspect is not considered as a main objective (i.e., sparsity levels between 10% and up to 50%), without adding (or even reducing) resource cost. We validate our claim on two types of data, images and videos, using several traditional and modern deep learning architectures for computer vision and three widely studied Dynamic Sparse Training algorithms. Our findings reveal a new yet-unknown benefit of Dynamic Sparse Training and open new possibilities in improving deep learning robustness beyond the current state of the art.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online hate speech has become increasingly prevalent on social media platforms, causing harm to individuals and society. While efforts have been made to combat this issue through content moderation, the potential of user-driven counterspeech as an alternative solution remains underexplored. Existing counterspeech methods often face challenges such as fear of retaliation and skill-related barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce CounterQuill, an AI-mediated system that assists users in composing effective and empathetic counterspeech. CounterQuill provides a three-step process: (1) a learning session to help users understand hate speech and counterspeech; (2) a brainstorming session that guides users in identifying key elements of hate speech and exploring counterspeech strategies; and (3) a co-writing session that enables users to draft and refine their counterspeech with CounterQuill. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 20 participants to evaluate CounterQuill in comparison to ChatGPT. Results show that CounterQuill's guidance and collaborative writing process provided users a stronger sense of ownership over their co-authored counterspeech. Users perceived CounterQuill as a writing partner and thus were more willing to post the co-written counterspeech online compared to the one written with ChatGPT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zachary Ravichandran, Varun Murali, Mariliza Tzes, George J. Pappas, Vijay Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable, users will want to describe high-level missions and have robots fill in the gaps. In many realistic settings, pre-built maps are difficult to obtain, so execution requires exploration and mapping that are necessary and specific to the mission. Consider an emergency response scenario where a user commands a robot, "triage impacted regions." The robot must infer relevant semantics (victims, etc.) and exploration targets (damaged regions) based on priors or other context, then explore and refine its plan online. These missions are incompletely specified, meaning they imply subtasks and semantics. While many semantic planning methods operate online, they are typically designed for well specified tasks such as object search or exploration. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful contextual reasoning over a range of robotic tasks described in natural language. However, existing LLM planners typically do not consider online planning or complex missions; rather, relevant subtasks are provided by a pre-built map or a user. We address these limitations via SPINE (online Semantic Planner for missions with Incomplete Natural language specifications in unstructured Environments). SPINE uses an LLM to reason about subtasks implied by the mission then realizes these subtasks in a receding horizon framework. Tasks are automatically validated for safety and refined online with new observations. We evaluate SPINE in simulation and real-world settings. Evaluation missions require multiple steps of semantic reasoning and exploration in cluttered outdoor environments of over 20,000m$^2$ area. We evaluate SPINE against competitive baselines in single-agent and air-ground teaming applications. Please find videos and software on our project page: https://zacravichandran.github.io/SPINE</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wu, Jiaru Zhang, Steven Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have evolved into advanced image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small set of images to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the potential risks of data leakage by releasing their fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets such as WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting approximately 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases, significantly surpassing baseline performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sociocultural norms serve as guiding principles for personal conduct in social interactions, emphasizing respect, cooperation, and appropriate behavior, which is able to benefit tasks including conversational information retrieval, contextual information retrieval and retrieval-enhanced machine learning. We propose a scalable approach for constructing a Sociocultural Norm (SCN) Base using Large Language Models (LLMs) for socially aware dialogues. We construct a comprehensive and publicly accessible Chinese Sociocultural NormBase. Our approach utilizes socially aware dialogues, enriched with contextual frames, as the primary data source to constrain the generating process and reduce the hallucinations. This enables extracting of high-quality and nuanced natural-language norm statements, leveraging the pragmatic implications of utterances with respect to the situation. As real dialogue annotated with gold frames are not readily available, we propose using synthetic data. Our empirical results show: (i) the quality of the SCNs derived from synthetic data is comparable to that from real dialogues annotated with gold frames, and (ii) the quality of the SCNs extracted from real data, annotated with either silver (predicted) or gold frames, surpasses that without the frame annotations. We further show the effectiveness of the extracted SCNs in a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to reason about multiple downstream dialogue tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming commodity components of larger software systems. This poses natural security and privacy problems: poisoned data retrieved from one component can change the model's behavior and compromise the entire system, including coercing the model to spread confidential data to untrusted components. One promising approach is to tackle this problem at the system level via dynamic information flow (aka taint) tracking. Unfortunately, the traditional approach of propagating the most restrictive input label to the output is too conservative for applications where LLMs operate on inputs retrieved from diverse sources. In this paper, we propose a novel, more permissive approach to propagate information flow labels through LLM queries. The key idea behind our approach is to propagate only the labels of the samples that were influential in generating the model output and to eliminate the labels of unnecessary input. We implement and investigate the effectiveness of two variations of this approach, based on (i) prompt-based retrieval augmentation, and (ii) a $k$-nearest-neighbors language model. We compare these with the baseline of an introspection-based influence estimator that directly asks the language model to predict the output label. The results obtained highlight the superiority of our prompt-based label propagator, which improves the label in more than 85% of the cases in an LLM agent setting. These findings underscore the practicality of permissive label propagation for retrieval augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahib Julka, Yashu Wang, Michael Granitzer</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentangled representation learning plays a pivotal role in making representations controllable, interpretable and transferable. Despite its significance in the domain, the quest for reliable and consistent quantitative disentanglement metric remains a major challenge. This stems from the utilisation of diverse metrics measuring different properties and the potential bias introduced by their design. Our work undertakes a comprehensive examination of existing popular disentanglement evaluation metrics, comparing them in terms of measuring aspects of disentanglement (viz. Modularity, Compactness, and Explicitness), detecting the factor-code relationship, and describing the degree of disentanglement. We propose a new framework for quantifying disentanglement, introducing a metric entitled \emph{EDI}, that leverages the intuitive concept of \emph{exclusivity} and improved factor-code relationship to minimize ad-hoc decisions. An in-depth analysis reveals that EDI measures essential properties while offering more stability than existing metrics, advocating for its adoption as a standardised approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Kerslake, Paul Denny, David H Smith IV, James Prather, Juho Leinonen, Andrew Luxton-Reilly, Stephen MacNeil</p>
<p>Abstract: Introductory programming courses often emphasize mastering syntax and basic constructs before progressing to more complex and interesting programs. This bottom-up approach can be frustrating for novices, shifting the focus away from problem solving and potentially making computing less appealing to a broad range of students. The rise of generative AI for code production could partially address these issues by fostering new skills via interaction with AI models, including constructing high-level prompts and evaluating code that is automatically generated. In this experience report, we explore the inclusion of two prompt-focused activities in an introductory course, implemented across four labs in a six-week module. The first requires students to solve computational problems by writing natural language prompts, emphasizing problem-solving over syntax. The second involves students crafting prompts to generate code equivalent to provided fragments, to foster an understanding of the relationship between prompts and code. Most of the students in the course had reported finding programming difficult to learn, often citing frustrations with syntax and debugging. We found that self-reported difficulty with learning programming had a strong inverse relationship with performance on traditional programming assessments such as tests and projects, as expected. However, performance on the natural language tasks was less strongly related to self-reported difficulty, suggesting they may target different skills. Learning how to communicate with AI coding models is becoming an important skill, and natural language prompting tasks may appeal to a broad range of students.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yorai Shaoul, Itamar Mishani, Shivam Vats, Jiaoyang Li, Maxim Likhachev</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Rao, Xuebo Liu, Lian Lian, Shengjun Cheng, Yunjie Liao, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: With instruction tuning, Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance their ability to adhere to commands. Diverging from most works focusing on data mixing, our study concentrates on enhancing the model's capabilities from the perspective of data sampling during training. Drawing inspiration from the human learning process, where it is generally easier to master solutions to similar topics through focused practice on a single type of topic, we introduce a novel instruction tuning strategy termed CommonIT: Commonality-aware Instruction Tuning. Specifically, we cluster instruction datasets into distinct groups with three proposed metrics (Task, Embedding and Length). We ensure each training mini-batch, or "partition", consists solely of data from a single group, which brings about both data randomness across mini-batches and intra-batch data similarity. Rigorous testing on LLaMa models demonstrates CommonIT's effectiveness in enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs through IT datasets (FLAN, CoT, and Alpaca) and models (LLaMa2-7B, Qwen2-7B, LLaMa 13B, and BLOOM 7B). CommonIT consistently boosts an average improvement of 2.1\% on the general domain (i.e., the average score of Knowledge, Reasoning, Multilinguality and Coding) with the Length metric, and 5.2\% on the special domain (i.e., GSM, Openfunctions and Code) with the Task metric, and 3.8\% on the specific tasks (i.e., MMLU) with the Embedding metric.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ernie Chang, Matteo Paltenghi, Yang Li, Pin-Jie Lin, Changsheng Zhao, Patrick Huber, Zechun Liu, Rastislav Rabatin, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws in language modeling traditionally quantify training loss as a function of dataset size and model parameters, providing compute-optimal estimates but often neglecting the impact of data quality on model generalization. In this paper, we extend the conventional understanding of scaling law by offering a microscopic view of data quality within the original formulation -- effective training tokens -- which we posit to be a critical determinant of performance for parameter-constrained language models. Specifically, we formulate the proposed term of effective training tokens to be a combination of two readily-computed indicators of text: (i) text diversity and (ii) syntheticity as measured by a teacher model. We pretrained over $200$ models of 25M to 1.5B parameters on a diverse set of sampled, synthetic data, and estimated the constants that relate text quality, model size, training tokens, and eight reasoning task accuracy scores. We demonstrated the estimated constants yield +0.83 Pearson correlation with true accuracies, and analyzed it in scenarios involving widely-used data techniques such as data sampling and synthesis which aim to improve data quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Jiang, Zhen Wang, Long Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Precise and flexible image editing remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Based on the modified areas, most editing methods can be divided into two main types: global editing and local editing. In this paper, we choose the two most common editing approaches (ie text-based editing and drag-based editing) and analyze their drawbacks. Specifically, text-based methods often fail to describe the desired modifications precisely, while drag-based methods suffer from ambiguity. To address these issues, we proposed \textbf{CLIPDrag}, a novel image editing method that is the first to combine text and drag signals for precise and ambiguity-free manipulations on diffusion models. To fully leverage these two signals, we treat text signals as global guidance and drag points as local information. Then we introduce a novel global-local motion supervision method to integrate text signals into existing drag-based methods by adapting a pre-trained language-vision model like CLIP. Furthermore, we also address the problem of slow convergence in CLIPDrag by presenting a fast point-tracking method that enforces drag points moving toward correct directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPDrag outperforms existing single drag-based methods or text-based methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mamba is emerging as a novel approach to overcome the challenges faced by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision. While CNNs excel at extracting local features, they often struggle to capture long-range dependencies without complex architectural modifications. In contrast, ViTs effectively model global relationships but suffer from high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of their self-attention mechanisms. Mamba addresses these limitations by leveraging Selective Structured State Space Models to effectively capture long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. This survey analyzes the unique contributions, computational benefits, and applications of Mamba models while also identifying challenges and potential future research directions. We provide a foundational resource for advancing the understanding and growth of Mamba models in computer vision.

<p>Abstract: Modeling the structure and events of the physical world constitutes a fundamental objective of neural networks. Among the diverse approaches, Graph Network Simulators (GNS) have emerged as the leading method for modeling physical phenomena, owing to their low computational cost and high accuracy. The datasets employed for training and evaluating physical simulation techniques are typically generated by researchers themselves, often resulting in limited data volume and quality. Consequently, this poses challenges in accurately assessing the performance of these methods. In response to this, we have constructed a high-quality physical simulation dataset encompassing 1D, 2D, and 3D scenes, along with more trajectories and time-steps compared to existing datasets. Furthermore, our work distinguishes itself by developing eight complete scenes, significantly enhancing the dataset's comprehensiveness. A key feature of our dataset is the inclusion of precise multi-body dynamics, facilitating a more realistic simulation of the physical world. Utilizing our high-quality dataset, we conducted a systematic evaluation of various existing GNS methods. Our dataset is accessible for download at https://github.com/Sherlocktein/MBDS, offering a valuable resource for researchers to enhance the training and evaluation of their methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongzhi Zhang, Kuang Wang, Liyuan Liu, Shuohang Wang, Hao Cheng, Chao Zhang, Yelong Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is a crucial component in serving transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling faster inference by storing previously computed KV vectors. However, its memory consumption scales linearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck in LLM deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1) efficient attention variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires extensive parameter tuning thus unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache compression at test time, primarily through token eviction policies, which often overlook inter-layer dependencies and can be task-specific.
  This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We propose a low-rank approximation of KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-in integration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining. To effectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise sensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is supported by our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in deep networks. Our method is designed to function without model tuning in upcycling stages or task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive experiments with LLaMA models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various tasks show that our approach significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint while maintaining performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Zhao, Yuchen Yang, Yijiang Li, Yinzhi Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: The ripple effect poses a significant challenge in knowledge editing for large language models. Namely, when a single fact is edited, the model struggles to accurately update the related facts in a sequence, which is evaluated by multi-hop questions linked to a chain of related facts. Recent strategies have moved away from traditional parameter updates to more flexible, less computation-intensive methods, proven to be more effective in addressing the ripple effect. In-context learning (ICL) editing uses a simple demonstration `Imagine that + new fact` to guide LLMs, but struggles with complex multi-hop questions as the new fact alone fails to specify the chain of facts involved in such scenarios. Besides, memory-based editing maintains additional storage for all edits and related facts, requiring continuous updates to stay effective. As a result of these design limitations, the challenge remains, with the highest accuracy being only 33.8% on the MQuAKE-cf benchmarks for Vicuna-7B. To address this, we propose RippleCOT, a novel ICL editing approach integrating Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning. RippleCOT structures demonstrations as `newfact, question, thought, answer`, incorporating a thought component to identify and decompose the multi-hop logic within questions. This approach effectively guides the model through complex multi-hop questions with chains of related facts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RippleCOT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ripple effect, achieving accuracy gains ranging from 7.8% to 87.1%.</p>

<p>Abstract: We explore how an AI model's decision fairness affects people's engagement with and perceived fairness of the model if they are subject to its decisions, but could repeatedly and strategically respond to these decisions. Two types of strategic responses are considered -- people could determine whether to continue interacting with the model, and whether to invest in themselves to improve their chance of future favorable decisions from the model. Via three human-subject experiments, we found that in decision subjects' strategic, repeated interactions with an AI model, the model's decision fairness does not change their willingness to interact with the model or to improve themselves, even when the model exhibits unfairness on salient protected attributes. However, decision subjects still perceive the AI model to be less fair when it systematically biases against their group, especially if the difficulty of improving one's qualification for the favorable decision is larger for the lowly-qualified people.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly pushed forward advancements in natural language processing, yet their high memory and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Binarization, as an effective compression technique, can shrink model weights to just 1 bit, significantly reducing the high demands on computation and memory. However, current binarization methods struggle to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, while also overlooking the column deviation in LLM weight distribution. To tackle these issues, we propose ARB-LLM, a novel 1-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) technique tailored for LLMs. To narrow the distribution shift between binarized and full-precision weights, we first design an alternating refined binarization (ARB) algorithm to progressively update the binarization parameters, which significantly reduces the quantization error. Moreover, considering the pivot role of calibration data and the column deviation in LLM weights, we further extend ARB to ARB-X and ARB-RC. In addition, we refine the weight partition strategy with column-group bitmap (CGB), which further enhance performance. Equipping ARB-X and ARB-RC with CGB, we obtain ARB-LLM$_\text{X}$ and ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ respectively, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) binarization methods for LLMs. As a binary PTQ method, our ARB-LLM$_\text{RC}$ is the first to surpass FP16 models of the same size.

<p>Abstract: Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language processing.

We propose the Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT), which extends the next-single-token prediction of causal transformers to support multi-token prediction in a single pass.

Based on CCT, we propose the Autoregressive Policy (ARP) model, which learns to generate action sequences autoregressively. We find that action sequence learning enables better leverage of the underlying causal relationships in robotic tasks. We evaluate ARP across diverse robotic manipulation environments, including Push-T, ALOHA, and RLBench, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in all tested environments, while being more efficient in computation and parameter sizes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Chen, Cheng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is crucial for maintaining modern industrial systems, where equipment reliability and operational safety are paramount. Traditional methods, based on small-scale deep learning or physical/statistical models, often struggle with complex, multidimensional sensor data and varying operating conditions, limiting their generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative regression framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) for RUL prediction. By leveraging the modeling power of LLMs pre-trained on corpus data, the proposed model can effectively capture complex temporal dependencies and improve prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on the Turbofan engine's RUL prediction task show that the proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the challenging FD002 and FD004 subsets and achieves near-SOTA results on the other subsets. Notably, different from previous research, our framework uses the same sliding window length and all sensor signals for all subsets, demonstrating strong consistency and generalization. Moreover, transfer learning experiments reveal that with minimal target domain data for fine-tuning, the model outperforms SOTA methods trained on full target domain data. This research highlights the significant potential of LLMs in industrial signal processing and RUL prediction, offering a forward-looking solution for health management in future intelligent industrial systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present MELODI, a novel memory architecture designed to efficiently process long documents using short context windows. The key principle behind MELODI is to represent short-term and long-term memory as a hierarchical compression scheme across both network layers and context windows. Specifically, the short-term memory is achieved through recurrent compression of context windows across multiple layers, ensuring smooth transitions between windows. In contrast, the long-term memory performs further compression within a single middle layer and aggregates information across context windows, effectively consolidating crucial information from the entire history. Compared to a strong baseline - the Memorizing Transformer employing dense attention over a large long-term memory (64K key-value pairs) - our method demonstrates superior performance on various long-context datasets while remarkably reducing the memory footprint by a factor of 8.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siddhanth Bhat</p>
<p>Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modelling long-range dependencies in sequence data. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SSMs offer a structured and stable approach to sequence modelling, leveraging principles from control theory and dynamical systems. However, a key challenge in sequence modelling is compressing long-term dependencies into a compact hidden state representation without losing critical information.
  In this paper, we develop a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding memory compression in selective state space models. We introduce a selective gating mechanism that dynamically filters and updates the hidden state based on input relevance, allowing for efficient memory compression. We formalize the trade-off between memory efficiency and information retention using information-theoretic tools, such as mutual information and rate-distortion theory. Our analysis provides theoretical bounds on the amount of information that can be compressed without sacrificing model performance.
  We also derive theorems that prove the stability and convergence of the hidden state in selective SSMs, ensuring reliable long-term memory retention. Computational complexity analysis reveals that selective SSMs offer significant improvements in memory efficiency and processing speed compared to traditional RNN-based models. Through empirical validation on sequence modelling tasks such as time-series forecasting and natural language processing, we demonstrate that selective SSMs achieve state-of-the-art performance while using less memory and computational resources.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose an Autoregressive (AR) Moving-average (MA) attention structure that can adapt to various linear attention mechanisms, enhancing their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that incorporating the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance, yet research has pointed out a serious issue with object hallucinations within these models. However, there is no clear conclusion as to which part of the model these hallucinations originate from. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation into the object hallucination problem specifically within the CLIP model, which serves as the backbone for many state-of-the-art vision-language systems. We unveil that even in isolation, the CLIP model is prone to object hallucinations, suggesting that the hallucination problem is not solely due to the interaction between vision and language modalities. To address this, we propose a counterfactual data augmentation method by creating negative samples with a variety of hallucination issues. We demonstrate that our method can effectively mitigate object hallucinations for CLIP model, and we show the the enhanced model can be employed as a visual encoder, effectively alleviating the object hallucination issue in LVLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moran Shkolnik, Maxim Fishman, Brian Chmiel, Hilla Ben-Yaacov, Ron Banner, Kfir Yehuda Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization has established itself as the primary approach for decreasing the computational and storage expenses associated with Large Language Models (LLMs) inference. The majority of current research emphasizes quantizing weights and activations to enable low-bit general-matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, with the remaining non-linear operations executed at higher precision. In our study, we discovered that following the application of these techniques, the primary bottleneck in LLMs inference lies in the softmax layer. The softmax operation comprises three phases: exponent calculation, accumulation, and normalization, Our work focuses on optimizing the first two phases. We propose an analytical approach to determine the optimal clipping value for the input to the softmax function, enabling sub-4-bit quantization for LLMs inference. This method accelerates the calculations of both $e^x$ and $\sum(e^x)$ with minimal to no accuracy degradation. For example, in LLaMA1-30B, we achieve baseline performance with 2-bit quantization on the well-known "Physical Interaction: Question Answering" (PIQA) dataset evaluation. This ultra-low bit quantization allows, for the first time, an acceleration of approximately 4x in the accumulation phase. The combination of accelerating both $e^x$ and $\sum(e^x)$ results in a 36.9% acceleration in the softmax operation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea M. Stor{\aa}s, Josefine V. Sundgaard</p>
<p>Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes, and monitoring the progression of retinal abnormalities using fundus imaging is crucial. Because the images must be interpreted by a medical expert, it is infeasible to screen all individuals with diabetes for diabetic retinopathy. Deep learning has shown impressive results for automatic analysis and grading of fundus images. One drawback is, however, the lack of interpretability, which hampers the implementation of such systems in the clinic. Explainable artificial intelligence methods can be applied to explain the deep neural networks. Explanations based on concepts have shown to be intuitive for humans to understand, but have not yet been explored in detail for diabetic retinopathy grading. This work investigates and compares two concept-based explanation techniques for explaining deep neural networks developed for automatic diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy: Quantitative Testing with Concept Activation Vectors and Concept Bottleneck Models. We found that both methods have strengths and weaknesses, and choice of method should take the available data and the end user's preferences into account.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taejun Bak, Youngsik Eom, SeungJae Choi, Young-Sun Joo</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems that scale up the amount of training data have achieved significant improvements in zero-shot speech synthesis. However, these systems have certain limitations: they require a large amount of training data, which increases costs, and often overlook prosody similarity. To address these issues, we propose MultiVerse, a zero-shot multi-task TTS system that is able to perform TTS or speech style transfer in zero-shot and cross-lingual conditions. MultiVerse requires much less training data than traditional data-driven approaches. To ensure zero-shot performance even with limited data, we leverage source-filter theory-based disentanglement, utilizing the prompt for modeling filter-related and source-related representations. Additionally, to further enhance prosody similarity, we adopt a prosody modeling approach combining prompt-based autoregressive and non-autoregressive methods. Evaluations demonstrate the remarkable zero-shot multi-task TTS performance of MultiVerse and show that MultiVerse not only achieves zero-shot TTS performance comparable to data-driven TTS systems with much less data, but also significantly outperforms other zero-shot TTS systems trained with the same small amount of data. In particular, our novel prosody modeling technique significantly contributes to MultiVerse's ability to generate speech with high prosody similarity to the given prompts.

<p>Abstract: In the last few years, the formulation of real-world optimization problems and their efficient solution via metaheuristic algorithms has been a catalyst for a myriad of research studies. In spite of decades of historical advancements on the design and use of metaheuristics, large difficulties still remain in regards to the understandability, algorithmic design uprightness, and performance verifiability of new technical achievements. A clear example stems from the scarce replicability of works dealing with metaheuristics used for optimization, which is often infeasible due to ambiguity and lack of detail in the presentation of the methods to be reproduced. Additionally, in many cases, there is a questionable statistical significance of their reported results. This work aims at providing the audience with a proposal of good practices which should be embraced when conducting studies about metaheuristics methods used for optimization in order to provide scientific rigor, value and transparency. To this end, we introduce a step by step methodology covering every research phase that should be followed when addressing this scientific field. Specifically, frequently overlooked yet crucial aspects and useful recommendations will be discussed in regards to the formulation of the problem, solution encoding, implementation of search operators, evaluation metrics, design of experiments, and considerations for real-world performance, among others. Finally, we will outline important considerations, challenges, and research directions for the success of newly developed optimization metaheuristics in their deployment and operation over real-world application environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anyi Rao, Jean-Pe\"ic Chou, Maneesh Agrawala</p>
<p>Abstract: Scriptwriters usually rely on their mental visualization to create a vivid story by using their imagination to see, feel, and experience the scenes they are writing. Besides mental visualization, they often refer to existing images or scenes in movies and analyze the visual elements to create a certain mood or atmosphere. In this paper, we develop ScriptViz to provide external visualization based on a large movie database for the screenwriting process. It retrieves reference visuals on the fly based on scripts' text and dialogue from a large movie database. The tool provides two types of control on visual elements that enable writers to 1) see exactly what they want with fixed visual elements and 2) see variances in uncertain elements. User evaluation among 15 scriptwriters shows that ScriptViz is able to present scriptwriters with consistent yet diverse visual possibilities, aligning closely with their scripts and helping their creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Gioacchini, Marco Mellia, Idilio Drago, Alexander Delsanto, Giuseppe Siracusano, Roberto Bifulco</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI agents, software systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are emerging as a promising approach to automate cybersecurity tasks. Among the others, penetration testing is a challenging field due to the task complexity and the diverse strategies to simulate cyber-attacks. Despite growing interest and initial studies in automating penetration testing with generative agents, there remains a significant gap in the form of a comprehensive and standard framework for their evaluation and development. This paper introduces AutoPenBench, an open benchmark for evaluating generative agents in automated penetration testing. We present a comprehensive framework that includes 33 tasks, each representing a vulnerable system that the agent has to attack. Tasks are of increasing difficulty levels, including in-vitro and real-world scenarios. We assess the agent performance with generic and specific milestones that allow us to compare results in a standardised manner and understand the limits of the agent under test. We show the benefits of AutoPenBench by testing two agent architectures: a fully autonomous and a semi-autonomous supporting human interaction. We compare their performance and limitations. For example, the fully autonomous agent performs unsatisfactorily achieving a 21% Success Rate (SR) across the benchmark, solving 27% of the simple tasks and only one real-world task. In contrast, the assisted agent demonstrates substantial improvements, with 64% of SR. AutoPenBench allows us also to observe how different LLMs like GPT-4o or OpenAI o1 impact the ability of the agents to complete the tasks. We believe that our benchmark fills the gap with a standard and flexible framework to compare penetration testing agents on a common ground. We hope to extend AutoPenBench along with the research community by making it available under https://github.com/lucagioacchini/auto-pen-bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Hausd\"orfer, Alexander von Rohr, \'Eric Lefort, Angela Schoellig</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in simulation often results in brittle and unrealistic learning outcomes. To push the agent towards more desirable solutions, prior information can be injected in the learning process through, for instance, reward shaping, expert data, or motion primitives. We propose an additional inductive bias for robot learning: latent actions learned from expert demonstration as priors in the action space. We show that these action priors can be learned from only a single open-loop gait cycle using a simple autoencoder. Using these latent action priors combined with established style rewards for imitation in DRL achieves above expert demonstration level of performance and leads to more desirable gaits. Further, action priors substantially improve the performance on transfer tasks, even leading to gait transitions for higher target speeds.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Bordt, Suraj Srinivas, Valentyn Boreiko, Ulrike von Luxburg</p>
<p>Abstract: The leakage of benchmark data into the training data has emerged as a significant challenge for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we use experimental evidence and theoretical estimates to challenge the common assumption that small-scale contamination renders benchmark evaluations invalid. First, we experimentally quantify the magnitude of benchmark overfitting based on scaling along three dimensions: The number of model parameters (up to 1.6B), the number of times an example is seen (up to 144), and the number of training tokens (up to 40B). We find that if model and data follow the Chinchilla scaling laws, minor contamination indeed leads to overfitting. At the same time, even 144 times of contamination can be forgotten if the training data is scaled beyond five times Chinchilla, a regime characteristic of many modern LLMs. We then derive a simple theory of example forgetting via cumulative weight decay. It allows us to bound the number of gradient steps required to forget past data for any training run where we know the hyperparameters of AdamW. This indicates that many LLMs, including Llama 3, have forgotten the data seen at the beginning of training. Experimentally, we demonstrate that forgetting occurs faster than what is predicted by our bounds. Taken together, our results suggest that moderate amounts of contamination can be forgotten at the end of realistically scaled training runs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuki Adachi, Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Atsutoshi Kumagai, Tomoki Hamagami</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates test-time adaptation (TTA) for regression, where a regression model pre-trained in a source domain is adapted to an unknown target distribution with unlabeled target data. Although regression is one of the fundamental tasks in machine learning, most of the existing TTA methods have classification-specific designs, which assume that models output class-categorical predictions, whereas regression models typically output only single scalar values. To enable TTA for regression, we adopt a feature alignment approach, which aligns the feature distributions between the source and target domains to mitigate the domain gap. However, we found that naive feature alignment employed in existing TTA methods for classification is ineffective or even worse for regression because the features are distributed in a small subspace and many of the raw feature dimensions have little significance to the output. For an effective feature alignment in TTA for regression, we propose Significant-subspace Alignment (SSA). SSA consists of two components: subspace detection and dimension weighting. Subspace detection finds the feature subspace that is representative and significant to the output. Then, the feature alignment is performed in the subspace during TTA. Meanwhile, dimension weighting raises the importance of the dimensions of the feature subspace that have greater significance to the output. We experimentally show that SSA outperforms various baselines on real-world datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Heart and lung sounds are crucial for healthcare monitoring. Recent improvements in stethoscope technology have made it possible to capture patient sounds with enhanced precision. In this dataset, we used a digital stethoscope to capture both heart and lung sounds, including individual and mixed recordings. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to offer both separate and mixed cardiorespiratory sounds. The recordings were collected from a clinical manikin, a patient simulator designed to replicate human physiological conditions, generating clean heart and lung sounds at different body locations. This dataset includes both normal sounds and various abnormalities (i.e., murmur, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, atrioventricular block, third and fourth heart sound, wheezing, crackles, rhonchi, pleural rub, and gurgling sounds). The dataset includes audio recordings of chest examinations performed at different anatomical locations, as determined by specialist nurses. Each recording has been enhanced using frequency filters to highlight specific sound types. This dataset is useful for applications in artificial intelligence, such as automated cardiopulmonary disease detection, sound classification, unsupervised separation techniques, and deep learning algorithms related to audio signal processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haibo Wang, Zhiyang Xu, Yu Cheng, Shizhe Diao, Yufan Zhou, Yixin Cao, Qifan Wang, Weifeng Ge, Lifu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in coarse-grained video understanding, however, they struggle with fine-grained temporal grounding. In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM, a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video moments in a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitations for fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporal modeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our model by incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationships between frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific time knowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training of Grounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning with simple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporal grounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhance Grounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a grounded VideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained grounding tasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and grounded VideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant for general video understanding.</p>

Once trained, this meta-model is fed with an observed input/output sequence (context) generated by a real system to predict its behavior in a zero-shot learning fashion. In this paper, we enhance the original meta-modeling framework through three key innovations: by formulating the learning task within a probabilistic framework; by managing non-contiguous context and query windows; and by adopting recurrent patching to effectively handle long context sequences. The efficacy of these modifications is demonstrated through a numerical example focusing on the Wiener-Hammerstein system class, highlighting the model's enhanced performance and scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: The work presented in this paper makes three scientific contributions with a specific focus on mining and analysis of COVID-19-related posts on Instagram. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 500,153 Instagram posts about COVID-19 published between January 2020 and September 2024. This dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in 161 different languages as well as 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the development of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed, which involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this dataset. Second, it presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per year from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related to COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, between 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive sentiment decreasing from 38.35% to 28.69%, while neutral sentiment rising from 44.19% to 58.34%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of language-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and contrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages on Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68% were positive, 14.84% were negative, and 35.48% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts, 4.40% were positive, 57.04% were negative, and 38.56% were neutral, reflecting distinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction-tuned LLMs are able to provide an explanation about their output to users by generating self-explanations that do not require gradient computations or the application of possibly complex XAI methods. In this paper, we analyse whether this ability results in a good explanation by evaluating self-explanations in the form of input rationales with respect to their plausibility to humans as well as their faithfulness to models. For this, we apply two text classification tasks: sentiment classification and forced labour detection. Next to English, we further include Danish and Italian translations of the sentiment classification task and compare self-explanations to human annotations for all samples. To allow for direct comparisons, we also compute post-hoc feature attribution, i.e., layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and apply this pipeline to 4 LLMs (Llama2, Llama3, Mistral and Mixtral). Our results show that self-explanations align more closely with human annotations compared to LRP, while maintaining a comparable level of faithfulness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional federated learning (FL) methods often rely on fixed weighting for parameter aggregation, neglecting the mutual influence by others. Hence, their effectiveness in heterogeneous data contexts is limited. To address this problem, we propose an influence-oriented federated learning framework, namely FedC^2I, which quantitatively measures Client-level and Class-level Influence to realize adaptive parameter aggregation for each client. Our core idea is to explicitly model the inter-client influence within an FL system via the well-crafted influence vector and influence matrix. The influence vector quantifies client-level influence, enables clients to selectively acquire knowledge from others, and guides the aggregation of feature representation layers. Meanwhile, the influence matrix captures class-level influence in a more fine-grained manner to achieve personalized classifier aggregation. We evaluate the performance of FedC^2I against existing federated learning methods under non-IID settings and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gary Murphy, Raghubir Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a novel and accurate approach to breast cancer classification using histopathology images. It systematically compares leading Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models across varying image datasets, identifies their optimal hyperparameters, and ranks them based on classification efficacy. To maximize classification accuracy for each model we explore, the effects of data augmentation, alternative fully-connected layers, model training hyperparameter settings, and, the advantages of retraining models versus using pre-trained weights. Our methodology includes several original concepts, including serializing generated datasets to ensure consistent data conditions across training runs and significantly reducing training duration. Combined with automated curation of results, this enabled the exploration of over 2,000 training permutations -- such a comprehensive comparison is as yet unprecedented. Our findings establish the settings required to achieve exceptional classification accuracy for standalone CNN models and rank them by model efficacy. Based on these results, we propose ensemble architectures that stack three high-performing standalone CNN models together with diverse classifiers, resulting in improved classification accuracy. The ability to systematically run so many model permutations to get the best outcomes gives rise to very high quality results, including 99.75% for BreakHis x40 and BreakHis x200 and 95.18% for the Bach datasets when split into train, validation and test datasets. The Bach Online blind challenge, yielded 89% using this approach. Whilst this study is based on breast cancer histopathology image datasets, the methodology is equally applicable to other medical image datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Abdulaal, Hugo Fry, Nina Monta\~na-Brown, Ayodeji Ijishakin, Jack Gao, Stephanie Hyland, Daniel C. Alexander, Daniel C. Castro</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiological services are experiencing unprecedented demand, leading to increased interest in automating radiology report generation. Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from hallucinations, lack interpretability, and require expensive fine-tuning. We introduce SAE-Rad, which uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose latent representations from a pre-trained vision transformer into human-interpretable features. Our hybrid architecture combines state-of-the-art SAE advancements, achieving accurate latent reconstructions while maintaining sparsity. Using an off-the-shelf language model, we distil ground-truth reports into radiological descriptions for each SAE feature, which we then compile into a full report for each image, eliminating the need for fine-tuning large models for this task. To the best of our knowledge, SAE-Rad represents the first instance of using mechanistic interpretability techniques explicitly for a downstream multi-modal reasoning task. On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, SAE-Rad achieves competitive radiology-specific metrics compared to state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer computational resources for training. Qualitative analysis reveals that SAE-Rad learns meaningful visual concepts and generates reports aligning closely with expert interpretations. Our results suggest that SAEs can enhance multimodal reasoning in healthcare, providing a more interpretable alternative to existing VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Doohyuk Jang, Sihwan Park, June Yong Yang, Yeonsung Jung, Jihun Yun, Souvik Kundu, Sung-Yub Kim, Eunho Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Auto-Regressive (AR) models have recently gained prominence in image generation, often matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion models. However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature, which processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to models like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently. While speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by generating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in this setting, which we term \textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual AR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering the performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose a relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the interchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the effectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more flexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected. Furthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that these speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality or semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding. In specific, compared to a na\"ive application of the state-of-the-art speculative decoding, LANTERN increases speed-ups by $\mathbf{1.75}\times$ and $\mathbf{1.76}\times$, as compared to greedy decoding and random sampling, respectively, when applied to LlamaGen, a contemporary visual AR model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chronic wounds and associated complications present ever growing burdens for clinics and hospitals world wide. Venous, arterial, diabetic, and pressure wounds are becoming increasingly common globally. These conditions can result in highly debilitating repercussions for those affected, with limb amputations and increased mortality risk resulting from infection becoming more common. New methods to assist clinicians in chronic wound care are therefore vital to maintain high quality care standards. This paper presents an improved HarDNet segmentation architecture which integrates a contrast-eliminating component in the initial layers of the network to enhance feature learning. We also utilise a multi-colour space tensor merging process and adjust the harmonic shape of the convolution blocks to facilitate these additional features. We train our proposed model using wound images from light-skinned patients and test the model on two test sets (one set with ground truth, and one without) comprising only darker-skinned cases. Subjective ratings are obtained from clinical wound experts with intraclass correlation coefficient used to determine inter-rater reliability. For the dark-skin tone test set with ground truth, we demonstrate improvements in terms of Dice similarity coefficient (+0.1221) and intersection over union (+0.1274). Qualitative analysis showed high expert ratings, with improvements of >3% demonstrated when comparing the baseline model with the proposed model. This paper presents the first study to focus on darker-skin tones for chronic wound segmentation using models trained only on wound images exhibiting lighter skin. Diabetes is highly prevalent in countries where patients have darker skin tones, highlighting the need for a greater focus on such cases. Additionally, we conduct the largest qualitative study to date for chronic wound segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patryk Krukowski, Daniel Wilczak, Jacek Tabor, Anna Bielawska, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: In various scenarios motivated by real life, such as medical data analysis, autonomous driving, and adversarial training, we are interested in robust deep networks. A network is robust when a relatively small perturbation of the input cannot lead to drastic changes in output (like change of class, etc.). This falls under the broader scope field of Neural Network Certification (NNC). Two crucial problems in NNC are of profound interest to the scientific community: how to calculate the robustness of a given pre-trained network and how to construct robust networks. The common approach to constructing robust networks is Interval Bound Propagation (IBP). This paper demonstrates that IBP is sub-optimal in the first case due to its susceptibility to the wrapping effect. Even for linear activation, IBP gives strongly sub-optimal bounds. Consequently, one should use strategies immune to the wrapping effect to obtain bounds close to optimal ones. We adapt two classical approaches dedicated to strict computations -- Dubleton Arithmetic and Affine Arithmetic -- to mitigate the wrapping effect in neural networks. These techniques yield precise results for networks with linear activation functions, thus resisting the wrapping effect. As a result, we achieve bounds significantly closer to the optimal level than IBPs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon James Carone, Pablo Ripoll\'es</p>
<p>Abstract: SoundSignature is a music application that integrates a custom OpenAI Assistant to analyze users' favorite songs. The system incorporates state-of-the-art Music Information Retrieval (MIR) Python packages to combine extracted acoustic/musical features with the assistant's extensive knowledge of the artists and bands. Capitalizing on this combined knowledge, SoundSignature leverages semantic audio and principles from the emerging Internet of Sounds (IoS) ecosystem, integrating MIR with AI to provide users with personalized insights into the acoustic properties of their music, akin to a musical preference personality report. Users can then interact with the chatbot to explore deeper inquiries about the acoustic analyses performed and how they relate to their musical taste. This interactivity transforms the application, acting not only as an informative resource about familiar and/or favorite songs, but also as an educational platform that enables users to deepen their understanding of musical features, music theory, acoustic properties commonly used in signal processing, and the artists behind the music. Beyond general usability, the application also incorporates several well-established open-source musician-specific tools, such as a chord recognition algorithm (CREMA), a source separation algorithm (DEMUCS), and an audio-to-MIDI converter (basic-pitch). These features allow users without coding skills to access advanced, open-source music processing algorithms simply by interacting with the chatbot (e.g., can you give me the stems of this song?). In this paper, we highlight the application's innovative features and educational potential, and present findings from a pilot user study that evaluates its efficacy and usability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tung M. Luu, Thanh Nguyen, Tee Joshua Tian Jin, Sungwoon Kim, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies reveal that well-performing reinforcement learning (RL) agents in training often lack resilience against adversarial perturbations during deployment. This highlights the importance of building a robust agent before deploying it in the real world. Most prior works focus on developing robust training-based procedures to tackle this problem, including enhancing the robustness of the deep neural network component itself or adversarially training the agent on strong attacks. In this work, we instead study an input transformation-based defense for RL. Specifically, we propose using a variant of vector quantization (VQ) as a transformation for input observations, which is then used to reduce the space of adversarial attacks during testing, resulting in the transformed observations being less affected by attacks. Our method is computationally efficient and seamlessly integrates with adversarial training, further enhancing the robustness of RL agents against adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments in multiple environments, we demonstrate that using VQ as the input transformation effectively defends against adversarial attacks on the agent's observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Menghua Wu, Umesh Padia, Sean H. Murphy, Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola</p>
<p>Abstract: Rationally identifying variables responsible for changes to a biological system can enable myriad applications in disease understanding and cell engineering. From a causality perspective, we are given two datasets generated by the same causal model, one observational (control) and one interventional (perturbed). The goal is to isolate the subset of measured variables (e.g. genes) that were the targets of the intervention, i.e. those whose conditional independencies have changed. Knowing the causal graph would limit the search space, allowing us to efficiently pinpoint these variables. However, current algorithms that infer causal graphs in the presence of unknown intervention targets scale poorly to the hundreds or thousands of variables in biological data, as they must jointly search the combinatorial spaces of graphs and consistent intervention targets. In this work, we propose a causality-inspired approach for predicting perturbation targets that decouples the two search steps. First, we use an amortized causal discovery model to separately infer causal graphs from the observational and interventional datasets. Then, we learn to map these paired graphs to the sets of variables that were intervened upon, in a supervised learning framework. This approach consistently outperforms baselines for perturbation modeling on seven single-cell transcriptomics datasets, each with thousands of measured variables. We also demonstrate significant improvements over six causal discovery algorithms in predicting intervention targets across a variety of tractable, synthetic datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijin Duan, Ruyi Ding, Jiaxing He, Aidong Adam Ding, Yunsi Fei, Xiaolin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-structured data is integral to many applications, prompting the development of various graph representation methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs), in particular, reconstruct graph structures from node embeddings. Current GAE models primarily utilize self-correlation to represent graph structures and focus on node-level tasks, often overlooking multi-graph scenarios. Our theoretical analysis indicates that self-correlation generally falls short in accurately representing specific graph features such as islands, symmetrical structures, and directional edges, particularly in smaller or multiple graph contexts. To address these limitations, we introduce a cross-correlation mechanism that significantly enhances the GAE representational capabilities. Additionally, we propose GraphCroc, a new GAE that supports flexible encoder architectures tailored for various downstream tasks and ensures robust structural reconstruction, through a mirrored encoding-decoding process. This model also tackles the challenge of representation bias during optimization by implementing a loss-balancing strategy. Both theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology significantly outperforms existing self-correlation-based GAEs in graph structure reconstruction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Event sequences, characterized by irregular sampling intervals and a mix of categorical and numerical features, are common data structures in various real-world domains such as healthcare, finance, and user interaction logs. Despite advances in temporal data modeling techniques, there is no standardized benchmarks for evaluating their performance on event sequences. This complicates result comparison across different papers due to varying evaluation protocols, potentially misleading progress in this field. We introduce EBES, a comprehensive benchmarking tool with standardized evaluation scenarios and protocols, focusing on regression and classification problems with sequence-level targets. Our library simplifies benchmarking, dataset addition, and method integration through a unified interface. It includes a novel synthetic dataset and provides preprocessed real-world datasets, including the largest publicly available banking dataset. Our results provide an in-depth analysis of datasets, identifying some as unsuitable for model comparison. We investigate the importance of modeling temporal and sequential components, as well as the robustness and scaling properties of the models. These findings highlight potential directions for future research. Our benchmark aim is to facilitate reproducible research, expediting progress and increasing real-world impacts.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03409">Comparative study of regression vs pairwise models for surrogate-based heuristic optimisation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo S. Naharro, Pablo Toharia, Antonio LaTorre, Jos\'e-Mar\'ia Pe\~na</p>
<p>Abstract: Heuristic optimisation algorithms explore the search space by sampling solutions, evaluating their fitness, and biasing the search in the direction of promising solutions. However, in many cases, this fitness function involves executing expensive computational calculations, drastically reducing the reasonable number of evaluations. In this context, surrogate models have emerged as an excellent alternative to alleviate these computational problems. This paper addresses the formulation of surrogate problems as both regression models that approximate fitness (surface surrogate models) and a novel way to connect classification models (pairwise surrogate models). The pairwise approach can be directly exploited by some algorithms, such as Differential Evolution, in which the fitness value is not actually needed to drive the search, and it is sufficient to know whether a solution is better than another one or not. Based on these modelling approaches, we have conducted a multidimensional analysis of surrogate models under different configurations: different machine learning algorithms (regularised regression, neural networks, decision trees, boosting methods, and random forests), different surrogate strategies (encouraging diversity or relaxing prediction thresholds), and compare them for both surface and pairwise surrogate models. The experimental part of the article includes the benchmark problems already proposed for the SOCO2011 competition in continuous optimisation and a simulation problem included in the recent GECCO2021 Industrial Challenge. This paper shows that the performance of the overall search, when using online machine learning-based surrogate models, depends not only on the accuracy of the predictive model but also on both the kind of bias towards positive or negative cases and how the optimisation uses those predictions to decide whether to execute the actual fitness function.</p>

<p>Abstract: While laparoscopic liver resection is less prone to complications and maintains patient outcomes compared to traditional open surgery, its complexity hinders widespread adoption due to challenges in representing the liver's internal structure. Laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound offers efficient, cost-effective and radiation-free guidance. Our objective is to aid physicians in identifying internal liver structures using laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound. We propose a patient-specific approach using preoperative 3D ultrasound liver volume to train a deep learning model for real-time identification of portal tree and branch structures. Our personalized AI model, validated on ex vivo swine livers, achieved superior precision (0.95) and recall (0.93) compared to surgeons, laying groundwork for precise vessel identification in ultrasound-based liver resection. Its adaptability and potential clinical impact promise to advance surgical interventions and improve patient care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangying Shao, Liang Zhang, Minlong Peng, Guoqi Ma, Hao Yue, Mingming Sun, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Keyphrase generation (KPG) aims to automatically generate a collection of phrases representing the core concepts of a given document. The dominant paradigms in KPG include one2seq and one2set. Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) to KPG. Our preliminary experiments reveal that it is challenging for a single model to excel in both recall and precision. Further analysis shows that: 1) the one2set paradigm owns the advantage of high recall, but suffers from improper assignments of supervision signals during training; 2) LLMs are powerful in keyphrase selection, but existing selection methods often make redundant selections. Given these observations, we introduce a generate-then-select framework decomposing KPG into two steps, where we adopt a one2set-based model as generator to produce candidates and then use an LLM as selector to select keyphrases from these candidates. Particularly, we make two important improvements on our generator and selector: 1) we design an Optimal Transport-based assignment strategy to address the above improper assignments; 2) we model the keyphrase selection as a sequence labeling task to alleviate redundant selections. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that our framework significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models, especially in absent keyphrase prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JJ Wilson, Maya Bechler-Speicher, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: In spite of the plethora of success stories with graph neural networks (GNNs) on modelling graph-structured data, they are notoriously vulnerable to over-squashing, whereby tasks necessitate the mixing of information between distance pairs of nodes. To address this problem, prior work suggests rewiring the graph structure to improve information flow. Alternatively, a significant body of research has dedicated itself to discovering and precomputing bottleneck-free graph structures to ameliorate over-squashing. One well regarded family of bottleneck-free graphs within the mathematical community are expander graphs, with prior work$\unicode{x2014}$Expander Graph Propagation (EGP)$\unicode{x2014}$proposing the use of a well-known expander graph family$\unicode{x2014}$the Cayley graphs of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ special linear group$\unicode{x2014}$as a computational template for GNNs. However, in EGP the computational graphs used are truncated to align with a given input graph. In this work, we show that truncation is detrimental to the coveted expansion properties. Instead, we propose CGP, a method to propagate information over a complete Cayley graph structure, thereby ensuring it is bottleneck-free to better alleviate over-squashing. Our empirical evidence across several real-world datasets not only shows that CGP recovers significant improvements as compared to EGP, but it is also akin to or outperforms computationally complex graph rewiring techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dazhong He, Qian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While visual and auditory information are prevalent in modern multimedia systems, haptic interaction, e.g., tactile and kinesthetic interaction, provides a unique form of human perception. However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Semantic text embedding is essential to many tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While black-box models are capable of generating high-quality embeddings, their lack of interpretability limits their use in tasks that demand transparency. Recent approaches have improved interpretability by leveraging domain-expert-crafted or LLM-generated questions, but these methods rely heavily on expert input or well-prompt design, which restricts their generalizability and ability to generate discriminative questions across a wide range of tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce \algo{CQG-MBQA} (Contrastive Question Generation - Multi-task Binary Question Answering), a general framework for producing interpretable semantic text embeddings across diverse tasks. Our framework systematically generates highly discriminative, low cognitive load yes/no questions through the \algo{CQG} method and answers them efficiently with the \algo{MBQA} model, resulting in interpretable embeddings in a cost-effective manner. We validate the effectiveness and interpretability of \algo{CQG-MBQA} through extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating that it delivers embedding quality comparable to many advanced black-box models while maintaining inherently interpretability. Additionally, \algo{CQG-MBQA} outperforms other interpretable text embedding methods across various downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyan Zhang, Chaojun Xiao, Qiujieli Qin, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Zeng, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Ruobing Xie, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained Transformers inherently possess the characteristic of sparse activation, where only a small fraction of the neurons are activated for each token. While sparse activation has been explored through post-training methods, its potential in pre-training remains untapped. In this work, we first study how activation properties change during pre-training. Our examination reveals that Transformers exhibit sparse activation throughout the majority of the pre-training process while the activation correlation keeps evolving as training progresses. Leveraging this observation, we propose Switchable Sparse-Dense Learning (SSD). SSD adaptively switches between the Mixtures-of-Experts (MoE) based sparse training and the conventional dense training during the pre-training process, leveraging the efficiency of sparse training and avoiding the static activation correlation of sparse training. Compared to dense training, SSD achieves comparable performance with identical model size and reduces pre-training costs. Moreover, the models trained with SSD can be directly used as MoE models for sparse inference and achieve the same performance as dense models with up to $2\times$ faster inference speed.

<p>Abstract: People with disabilities (PwD) regularly encounter ableist hate and microaggressions online. While online platforms use machine learning models to moderate online harm, there is little research investigating how these models interact with ableism. In this paper, we curated a dataset of 100 social media comments targeted towards PwD, and recruited 160 participants to rate and explain how toxic and ableist these comments were. We then prompted state-of-the art toxicity classifiers (TCs) and large language models (LLMs) to rate and explain the harm. Our analysis revealed that TCs and LLMs rated toxicity significantly lower than PwD, but LLMs rated ableism generally on par with PwD. However, ableism explanations by LLMs overlooked emotional harm, and lacked specificity and acknowledgement of context, important facets of PwD explanations. Going forward, we discuss challenges in designing disability-aware toxicity classifiers, and advocate for the shift from ableism detection to ableism interpretation and explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rayhan Zirvi, Bahareh Tolooshams, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p>

  In this study, we explore a novel approach to vulnerability detection utilizing the tools from topological data analysis (TDA) on the attention matrices of the BERT model. Our findings reveal that traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, when trained on the topological features extracted from these attention matrices, can perform competitively with pre-trained language models (LLMs) such as CodeBERTa. This suggests that TDA tools, including persistent homology, are capable of effectively capturing semantic information critical for identifying vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large conferences such as NeurIPS and AAAI serve as crossroads of various AI fields, since they attract submissions from a vast number of communities. However, in some cases, this has resulted in a poor reviewing experience for some communities, whose submissions get assigned to less qualified reviewers outside of their communities. An often-advocated solution is to break up any such large conference into smaller conferences, but this can lead to isolation of communities and harm interdisciplinary research. We tackle this challenge by introducing a notion of group fairness, called the core, which requires that every possible community (subset of researchers) to be treated in a way that prevents them from unilaterally benefiting by withdrawing from a large conference.
  We study a simple peer review model, prove that it always admits a reviewing assignment in the core, and design an efficient algorithm to find one such assignment. We use real data from CVPR and ICLR conferences to compare our algorithm to existing reviewing assignment algorithms on a number of metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kashish Gandhi, Prutha Kulkarni, Taran Shah, Piyush Chaudhari, Meera Narvekar, Kranti Ghag</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake technology poses a significant threat to digital media integrity. Deepfakes, synthetic media created using AI, can convincingly alter videos and audio to misrepresent reality. This creates risks of misinformation, fraud, and severe implications for personal privacy and security. Our research addresses the critical issue of deepfakes through an innovative multimodal approach, targeting both visual and auditory elements. This comprehensive strategy recognizes that human perception integrates multiple sensory inputs, particularly visual and auditory information, to form a complete understanding of media content. For visual analysis, a model that employs advanced feature extraction techniques was developed, extracting nine distinct facial characteristics and then applying various machine learning and deep learning models. For auditory analysis, our model leverages mel-spectrogram analysis for feature extraction and then applies various machine learning and deep learningmodels. To achieve a combined analysis, real and deepfake audio in the original dataset were swapped for testing purposes and ensured balanced samples. Using our proposed models for video and audio classification i.e. Artificial Neural Network and VGG19, the overall sample is classified as deepfake if either component is identified as such. Our multimodal framework combines visual and auditory analyses, yielding an accuracy of 94%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Rando, Hannah Korevaar, Erik Brinkman, Ivan Evtimov, Florian Tram\`er</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting language models with image inputs may enable more effective jailbreak attacks through continuous optimization, unlike text inputs that require discrete optimization. However, new multimodal fusion models tokenize all input modalities using non-differentiable functions, which hinders straightforward attacks. In this work, we introduce the notion of a tokenizer shortcut that approximates tokenization with a continuous function and enables continuous optimization. We use tokenizer shortcuts to create the first end-to-end gradient image attacks against multimodal fusion models. We evaluate our attacks on Chameleon models and obtain jailbreak images that elicit harmful information for 72.5% of prompts. Jailbreak images outperform text jailbreaks optimized with the same objective and require 3x lower compute budget to optimize 50x more input tokens. Finally, we find that representation engineering defenses, like Circuit Breakers, trained only on text attacks can effectively transfer to adversarial image inputs.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce SynFormer, a generative modeling framework designed to efficiently explore and navigate synthesizable chemical space. Unlike traditional molecular generation approaches, we generate synthetic pathways for molecules to ensure that designs are synthetically tractable. By incorporating a scalable transformer architecture and a diffusion module for building block selection, SynFormer surpasses existing models in synthesizable molecular design. We demonstrate SynFormer's effectiveness in two key applications: (1) local chemical space exploration, where the model generates synthesizable analogs of a reference molecule, and (2) global chemical space exploration, where the model aims to identify optimal molecules according to a black-box property prediction oracle. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach via the improvement in performance as more computational resources become available. With our code and trained models openly available, we hope that SynFormer will find use across applications in drug discovery and materials science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunny Gupta, Nikita Jangid, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates data privacy by enabling collaborative in-situ training across decentralized clients. Despite its inherent advantages, FL faces significant challenges of performance and convergence when dealing with data that is not independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.). While previous research has primarily addressed the issue of skewed label distribution across clients, this study focuses on the less explored challenge of multi-domain FL, where client data originates from distinct domains with varying feature distributions. We introduce a novel method designed to address these challenges FedStein: Enhancing Multi-Domain Federated Learning Through the James-Stein Estimator. FedStein uniquely shares only the James-Stein (JS) estimates of batch normalization (BN) statistics across clients, while maintaining local BN parameters. The non-BN layer parameters are exchanged via standard FL techniques. Extensive experiments conducted across three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that FedStein surpasses existing methods such as FedAvg and FedBN, with accuracy improvements exceeding 14% in certain domains leading to enhanced domain generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyuan Wang, Haozhou Li, Dingfang Zheng, Qinke Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: The global COVID-19 pandemic underscored major deficiencies in traditional healthcare systems, hastening the advancement of online medical services, especially in medical triage and consultation. However, existing studies face two main challenges. First, the scarcity of large-scale, publicly available, domain-specific medical datasets due to privacy concerns, with current datasets being small and limited to a few diseases, limiting the effectiveness of triage methods based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Second, existing methods lack medical knowledge and struggle to accurately understand professional terms and expressions in patient-doctor consultations. To overcome these obstacles, we construct the Large-scale Chinese Medical Dialogue Corpora (LCMDC), comprising a Coarse-grained Triage dataset with 439,630 samples, a Fine-grained Diagnosis dataset with 199,600 samples, and a Medical Consultation dataset with 472,418 items, thereby addressing the data shortage in this field. Moreover, we further propose a novel triage system that combines BERT-based supervised learning with prompt learning, as well as a GPT-based medical consultation model using reinforcement learning. To enhance domain knowledge acquisition, we pre-trained PLMs using our self-constructed background corpus. Experimental results on the LCMDC demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Scholten, Stephan G\"unnemann, Leo Schwinn</p>
<p>Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an open research problem. Existing evaluations rely on deterministic point estimates generated via greedy decoding. However, we find that deterministic evaluations fail to capture the whole output distribution of a model, yielding inaccurate estimations of model capabilities. This is particularly problematic in critical contexts such as unlearning and alignment, where precise model evaluations are crucial. To remedy this, we introduce the first formal probabilistic evaluation framework in LLMs. Namely, we derive novel metrics with high-probability guarantees concerning the output distribution of a model. Our metrics are application-independent and allow practitioners to make more reliable estimates about model capabilities before deployment. Through a case study focused on unlearning, we reveal that deterministic evaluations falsely indicate successful unlearning, whereas our probabilistic evaluations demonstrate that most if not all of the supposedly unlearned information remains accessible in these models. Additionally, we propose a novel unlearning loss based on entropy optimization and adaptive temperature scaling, which significantly improves unlearning in probabilistic settings on recent benchmarks. Our proposed shift from point estimates to probabilistic evaluations of output distributions represents an important step toward comprehensive evaluations of LLMs. https://github.com/yascho/probabilistic-unlearning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Jiang, Junwen Duan, Zhe Qu, Jianxin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised rationale extraction aims to extract text snippets to support model predictions without explicit rationale annotation. Researchers have made many efforts to solve this task. Previous works often encode each aspect independently, which may limit their ability to capture meaningful internal correlations between aspects. While there has been significant work on mitigating spurious correlations, our approach focuses on leveraging the beneficial internal correlations to improve multi-aspect rationale extraction. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Aspect Rationale Extractor (MARE) to explain and predict multiple aspects simultaneously. Concretely, we propose a Multi-Aspect Multi-Head Attention (MAMHA) mechanism based on hard deletion to encode multiple text chunks simultaneously. Furthermore, multiple special tokens are prepended in front of the text with each corresponding to one certain aspect. Finally, multi-task training is deployed to reduce the training overhead. Experimental results on two unsupervised rationale extraction benchmarks show that MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Song, Liyuan Han, Bo Xu, Tielin Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are an advanced fusion of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, requiring stable and long-term decoding of neural signals. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their neuronal dynamics and spike-based signal processing, are inherently well-suited for this task. This paper presents a novel approach utilizing a Multiscale Fusion enhanced Spiking Neural Network (MFSNN). The MFSNN emulates the parallel processing and multiscale feature fusion seen in human visual perception to enable real-time, efficient, and energy-conserving neural signal decoding. Initially, the MFSNN employs temporal convolutional networks and channel attention mechanisms to extract spatiotemporal features from raw data. It then enhances decoding performance by integrating these features through skip connections. Additionally, the MFSNN improves generalizability and robustness in cross-day signal decoding through mini-batch supervised generalization learning. In two benchmark invasive BCI paradigms, including the single-hand grasp-and-touch and center-and-out reach tasks, the MFSNN surpasses traditional artificial neural network methods, such as MLP and GRU, in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, the MFSNN's multiscale feature fusion framework is well-suited for the implementation on neuromorphic chips, offering an energy-efficient solution for online decoding of invasive BCI signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikola Jovanovi\'c, Robin Staab, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLMs by enabling them to incorporate external data during generation. This raises concerns for data owners regarding unauthorized use of their content in RAG systems. Despite its importance, the challenge of detecting such unauthorized usage remains underexplored, with existing datasets and methodologies from adjacent fields being ill-suited for its study. In this work, we take several steps to bridge this gap. First, we formalize this problem as (black-box) RAG Dataset Inference (RAG-DI). To facilitate research on this challenge, we further introduce a novel dataset specifically designed for benchmarking RAG-DI methods under realistic conditions, and propose a set of baseline approaches. Building on this foundation, we introduce Ward, a RAG-DI method based on LLM watermarks that enables data owners to obtain rigorous statistical guarantees regarding the usage of their dataset in a RAG system. In our experimental evaluation, we show that Ward consistently outperforms all baselines across many challenging settings, achieving higher accuracy, superior query efficiency and robustness. Our work provides a foundation for future studies of RAG-DI and highlights LLM watermarks as a promising approach to this problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of online micro-video platforms has underscored the necessity for advanced recommender systems to mitigate information overload and deliver tailored content. Despite advancements, accurately and promptly capturing dynamic user interests remains a formidable challenge. Inspired by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that different data modalities converge towards a shared statistical model of reality, we introduce DreamUMM (Dreaming User Multi-Modal Representation), a novel approach leveraging user historical behaviors to create real-time user representation in a multimoda space. DreamUMM employs a closed-form solution correlating user video preferences with multimodal similarity, hypothesizing that user interests can be effectively represented in a unified multimodal space. Additionally, we propose Candidate-DreamUMM for scenarios lacking recent user behavior data, inferring interests from candidate videos alone. Extensive online A/B tests demonstrate significant improvements in user engagement metrics, including active days and play count. The successful deployment of DreamUMM in two micro-video platforms with hundreds of millions of daily active users, illustrates its practical efficacy and scalability in personalized micro-video content delivery. Our work contributes to the ongoing exploration of representational convergence by providing empirical evidence supporting the potential for user interest representations to reside in a multimodal space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Noever, Samantha E. Miller Noever</p>
<p>Abstract: This study reveals an unexpected parallel between instructible vision-language models (VLMs) and human cognitive disorders, specifically constructive apraxia. We tested 25 state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4 Vision, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney v5, on their ability to generate images of the Ponzo illusion, a task that requires basic spatial reasoning and is often used in clinical assessments of constructive apraxia. Remarkably, 24 out of 25 models failed to correctly render two horizontal lines against a perspective background, mirroring the deficits seen in patients with parietal lobe damage. The models consistently misinterpreted spatial instructions, producing tilted or misaligned lines that followed the perspective of the background rather than remaining horizontal. This behavior is strikingly similar to how apraxia patients struggle to copy or construct simple figures despite intact visual perception and motor skills. Our findings suggest that current VLMs, despite their advanced capabilities in other domains, lack fundamental spatial reasoning abilities akin to those impaired in constructive apraxia. This limitation in AI systems provides a novel computational model for studying spatial cognition deficits and highlights a critical area for improvement in VLM architecture and training methodologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

<p>Abstract: The taste electroencephalogram (EEG) evoked by the taste stimulation can reflect different brain patterns and be used in applications such as sensory evaluation of food. However, considering the computational cost and efficiency, EEG data with many channels has to face the critical issue of channel selection. This paper proposed a channel selection method called class activation mapping with attention (CAM-Attention). The CAM-Attention method combined a convolutional neural network with channel and spatial attention (CNN-CSA) model with a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) model. The CNN-CSA model exploited key features in EEG data by attention mechanism, and the Grad-CAM model effectively realized the visualization of feature regions. Then, channel selection was effectively implemented based on feature regions. Finally, the CAM-Attention method reduced the computational burden of taste EEG recognition and effectively distinguished the four tastes. In short, it has excellent recognition performance and provides effective technical support for taste sensory evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Weltevrede, Caroline Horsch, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Wendelin B\"ohmer</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-task reinforcement learning, agents train on a fixed set of tasks and have to generalise to new ones. Recent work has shown that increased exploration improves this generalisation, but it remains unclear why exactly that is. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reachability in multi-task reinforcement learning and show that an initial exploration phase increases the number of reachable tasks the agent is trained on. This, and not the increased exploration, is responsible for the improved generalisation, even to unreachable tasks. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method Explore-Go that implements such an exploration phase at the beginning of each episode. Explore-Go only modifies the way experience is collected and can be used with most existing on-policy or off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method when combined with some popular algorithms and show an increase in generalisation performance across several environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving software generates enormous amounts of data every second, which software development organizations save for future analysis and testing in the form of logs. However, given the vast size of this data, locating specific scenarios within a collection of vehicle logs can be challenging. Writing the correct SQL queries to find these scenarios requires engineers to have a strong background in SQL and the specific databases in question, further complicating the search process. This paper presents and evaluates a pipeline that allows searching for specific scenarios in log collections using natural language descriptions instead of SQL. The generated descriptions were evaluated by engineers working with vehicle logs at the Zenseact on a scale from 1 to 5. Our approach achieved a mean score of 3.3, demonstrating the potential of using a multi-model architecture to improve the software development workflow. We also present an interface that can visualize the query process and visualize the results.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising approach for modeling 3D scenes using mixtures of Gaussians. The predominant optimization method for these models relies on backpropagating gradients through a differentiable rendering pipeline, which struggles with catastrophic forgetting when dealing with continuous streams of data. To address this limitation, we propose Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting (VBGS), a novel approach that frames training a Gaussian splat as variational inference over model parameters. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of multivariate Gaussians, we derive a closed-form variational update rule, allowing efficient updates from partial, sequential observations without the need for replay buffers. Our experiments show that VBGS not only matches state-of-the-art performance on static datasets, but also enables continual learning from sequentially streamed 2D and 3D data, drastically improving performance in this setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prateek Yadav, Tu Vu, Jonathan Lai, Alexandra Chronopoulou, Manaal Faruqui, Mohit Bansal, Tsendsuren Munkhdalai</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple expert models into a more capable single model, offering benefits such as reduced storage and serving costs, improved generalization, and support for decentralized model development. Despite its promise, previous studies have primarily focused on merging a few small models. This leaves many unanswered questions about the effect of scaling model size and how it interplays with other key factors -- like the base model quality and number of expert models -- , to affect the merged model's performance. This work systematically evaluates the utility of model merging at scale, examining the impact of these different factors. We experiment with merging fully fine-tuned models using 4 popular merging methods -- Averaging, Task~Arithmetic, Dare, and TIES -- across model sizes ranging from 1B-64B parameters and merging up to 8 different expert models. We evaluate the merged models on both held-in tasks, i.e., the expert's training tasks, and zero-shot generalization to unseen held-out tasks. Our experiments provide several new insights about model merging at scale and the interplay between different factors. First, we find that merging is more effective when experts are created from strong base models, i.e., models with good zero-shot performance. Second, larger models facilitate easier merging. Third merging consistently improves generalization capabilities. Notably, when merging 8 large expert models, the merged models often generalize better compared to the multitask trained models. Fourth, we can better merge more expert models when working with larger models. Fifth, different merging methods behave very similarly at larger scales. Overall, our findings shed light on some interesting properties of model merging while also highlighting some limitations. We hope that this study will serve as a reference point on large-scale merging for upcoming research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shujin Wu, May Fung, Cheng Qian, Jeonghwan Kim, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly advanced capabilities, aligning their behaviors with human values and preferences becomes crucial for their wide adoption. While previous research focuses on general alignment to principles such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty, the need to account for individual and diverse preferences has been largely overlooked, potentially undermining customized human experiences. To address this gap, we train LLMs that can ''interact to align'', essentially cultivating the meta-skill of LLMs to implicitly infer the unspoken personalized preferences of the current user through multi-turn conversations, and then dynamically align their following behaviors and responses to these inferred preferences. Our approach involves establishing a diverse pool of 3,310 distinct user personas by initially creating seed examples, which are then expanded through iterative self-generation and filtering. Guided by distinct user personas, we leverage multi-LLM collaboration to develop a multi-turn preference dataset containing 3K+ multi-turn conversations in tree structures. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs using this dataset. For evaluation, we establish the ALOE (ALign With CustOmized PrEferences) benchmark, consisting of 100 carefully selected examples and well-designed metrics to measure the customized alignment performance during conversations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enabling dynamic, personalized alignment via interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pu Hua, Minghuan Liu, Annabella Macaluso, Yunfeng Lin, Weinan Zhang, Huazhe Xu, Lirui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic simulation today remains challenging to scale up due to the human efforts required to create diverse simulation tasks and scenes. Simulation-trained policies also face scalability issues as many sim-to-real methods focus on a single task. To address these challenges, this work proposes GenSim2, a scalable framework that leverages coding LLMs with multi-modal and reasoning capabilities for complex and realistic simulation task creation, including long-horizon tasks with articulated objects. To automatically generate demonstration data for these tasks at scale, we propose planning and RL solvers that generalize within object categories. The pipeline can generate data for up to 100 articulated tasks with 200 objects and reduce the required human efforts. To utilize such data, we propose an effective multi-task language-conditioned policy architecture, dubbed proprioceptive point-cloud transformer (PPT), that learns from the generated demonstrations and exhibits strong sim-to-real zero-shot transfer. Combining the proposed pipeline and the policy architecture, we show a promising usage of GenSim2 that the generated data can be used for zero-shot transfer or co-train with real-world collected data, which enhances the policy performance by 20% compared with training exclusively on limited real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zian Li, Cai Zhou, Xiyuan Wang, Xingang Peng, Muhan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions. We decompose the molecule generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively easy-to-generate representation in the first-stage guides the second-stage generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much faster way. Leveraging EDM as the base generator, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely-used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while maintaining superior generation quality than that achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the generation process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuochun Li, Yuelyu Ji, Rui Meng, Daqing He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited complex reasoning abilities by generating question rationales and demonstrated exceptional performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, these reasoning capabilities generally emerge in models with tens of billions of parameters, creating significant computational challenges for real-world deployment. Recent research has concentrated on improving open-source smaller models through knowledge distillation (KD) from commercial LLMs. Nevertheless, most of these studies rely solely on the responses from one single LLM as the gold rationale for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel Mistake-Aware Peer-Review Distillation (MAPD) approach: 1) Instead of merely obtaining gold rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data. 2) We design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, which selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold. This reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present EgoAllo, a system for human motion estimation from a head-mounted device. Using only egocentric SLAM poses and images, EgoAllo guides sampling from a conditional diffusion model to estimate 3D body pose, height, and hand parameters that capture the wearer's actions in the allocentric coordinate frame of the scene. To achieve this, our key insight is in representation: we propose spatial and temporal invariance criteria for improving model performance, from which we derive a head motion conditioning parameterization that improves estimation by up to 18%. We also show how the bodies estimated by our system can improve the hands: the resulting kinematic and temporal constraints result in over 40% lower hand estimation errors compared to noisy monocular estimates.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifeng Ding, Jingcheng Wu, Jingpei Wu, Yan Xia, Volker Tresp</p>
<p>Abstract: Stemming from traditional knowledge graphs (KGs), hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) provide additional key-value pairs (i.e., qualifiers) for each KG fact that help to better restrict the fact validity. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying graph reasoning over HKGs. Meanwhile, as discussed in recent works that focus on temporal KGs (TKGs), world knowledge is ever-evolving, making it important to reason over temporal facts in KGs. Previous mainstream benchmark HKGs do not explicitly specify temporal information for each HKG fact. Therefore, almost all existing HKG reasoning approaches do not devise any module specifically for temporal reasoning. To better study temporal fact reasoning over HKGs, we propose a new type of data structure named hyper-relational TKG (HTKG). Every fact in an HTKG is coupled with a timestamp explicitly indicating its time validity. We develop two new benchmark HTKG datasets, i.e., Wiki-hy and YAGO-hy, and propose an HTKG reasoning model that efficiently models hyper-relational temporal facts. To support future research on this topic, we open-source our datasets and model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taylor Webb, Shanka Subhra Mondal, Ida Momennejad</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, but they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or goal-directed planning. Both cognitive neuroscience and reinforcement learning (RL) have proposed a number of interacting functional components that together implement search and evaluation in multi-step decision making. These components include conflict monitoring, state prediction, state evaluation, task decomposition, and orchestration. To improve planning with LLMs, we propose an agentic architecture, the Modular Agentic Planner (MAP), in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent interaction of the specialized modules mentioned above, each implemented using an LLM. MAP improves planning through the interaction of specialized modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief automated calls to the LLM. We evaluate MAP on three challenging planning tasks -- graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi, and the PlanBench benchmark -- as well as an NLP task requiring multi-step reasoning (strategyQA). We find that MAP yields significant improvements over both standard LLM methods (zero-shot prompting, in-context learning) and competitive baselines (chain-of-thought, multi-agent debate, and tree-of-thought), can be effectively combined with smaller and more cost-efficient LLMs (Llama3-70B), and displays superior transfer across tasks. These results suggest the benefit of a modular and multi-agent approach to planning with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Evdoxia Taka, Yuri Nakao, Ryosuke Sonoda, Takuya Yokota, Lin Luo, Simone Stumpf</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness is a growing concern for high-risk decision-making using Artificial Intelligence (AI) but ensuring it through purely technical means is challenging: there is no universally accepted fairness measure, fairness is context-dependent, and there might be conflicting perspectives on what is considered fair. Thus, involving stakeholders, often without a background in AI or fairness, is a promising avenue. Research to directly involve stakeholders is in its infancy, and many questions remain on how to support stakeholders to feedback on fairness, and how this feedback can be integrated into AI models. Our work follows an approach where stakeholders can give feedback on specific decision instances and their outcomes with respect to their fairness, and then to retrain an AI model. In order to investigate this approach, we conducted two studies of a complex AI model for credit rating used in loan applications. In study 1, we collected feedback from 58 lay users on loan application decisions, and conducted offline experiments to investigate the effects on accuracy and fairness metrics. In study 2, we deepened this investigation by showing 66 participants the results of their feedback with respect to fairness, and then conducted further offline analyses. Our work contributes two datasets and associated code frameworks to bootstrap further research, highlights the opportunities and challenges of employing lay user feedback for improving AI fairness, and discusses practical implications for developing AI applications that more closely reflect stakeholder views about fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei You, Lele Cao, Mattias Nilsson, Bo Zhao, Lei Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CE) are the de facto method for providing insights into black-box decision-making models by identifying alternative inputs that lead to different outcomes. However, existing CE approaches, including group and global methods, focus predominantly on specific input modifications, lacking the ability to capture nuanced distributional characteristics that influence model outcomes across the entire input-output spectrum. This paper proposes distributional counterfactual explanation (DCE), shifting focus to the distributional properties of observed and counterfactual data, thus providing broader insights. DCE is particularly beneficial for stakeholders making strategic decisions based on statistical data analysis, as it makes the statistical distribution of the counterfactual resembles the one of the factual when aligning model outputs with a target distribution\textemdash something that the existing CE methods cannot fully achieve. We leverage optimal transport (OT) to formulate a chance-constrained optimization problem, deriving a counterfactual distribution aligned with its factual counterpart, supported by statistical confidence. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through experiments, highlighting its potential to provide deeper insights into decision-making models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Echterhoff, Yao Liu, Abeer Alessa, Julian McAuley, Zexue He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential as tools to support an expanding range of decision-making tasks. Given their training on human (created) data, LLMs have been shown to inherit societal biases against protected groups, as well as be subject to bias functionally resembling cognitive bias. Human-like bias can impede fair and explainable decisions made with LLM assistance. Our work introduces BiasBuster, a framework designed to uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and cognitive science, we develop a dataset containing 13,465 prompts to evaluate LLM decisions on different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential, inherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, while proposing a novel method utilizing LLMs to debias their own human-like cognitive bias within prompts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture of the presence and effects of cognitive bias across commercial and open-source models. We demonstrate that our selfhelp debiasing effectively mitigates model answers that display patterns akin to human cognitive bias without having to manually craft examples for each bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: Is artificial consciousness theoretically possible? Is it plausible? If so, is it technically feasible? To make progress on these questions, it is necessary to lay some groundwork clarifying the logical and empirical conditions for artificial consciousness to arise and the meaning of relevant terms involved. Consciousness is a polysemic word: researchers from different fields, including neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and philosophy, among others, sometimes use different terms in order to refer to the same phenomena or the same terms to refer to different phenomena. In fact, if we want to pursue artificial consciousness, a proper definition of the key concepts is required. Here, after some logical and conceptual preliminaries, we argue for the necessity of using dimensions and profiles of consciousness for a balanced discussion about their possible instantiation or realisation in artificial systems. Our primary goal in this paper is to review the main theoretical questions that arise in the domain of artificial consciousness. On the basis of this review, we propose to assess the issue of artificial consciousness within a multidimensional account. The theoretical possibility of artificial consciousness is already presumed within some theoretical frameworks; however, empirical possibility cannot simply be deduced from these frameworks but needs independent empirical validation. We break down the complexity of consciousness by identifying constituents, components, and dimensions, and reflect pragmatically about the general challenges confronting the creation of artificial consciousness. Despite these challenges, we outline a research strategy for showing how "awareness" as we propose to understand it could plausibly be realised in artificial systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caroline Wang, Arrasy Rahman, Ishan Durugkar, Elad Liebman, Peter Stone</p>
<p>Abstract: Current approaches to learning cooperative multi-agent behaviors assume relatively restrictive settings. In standard fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, the learning algorithm controls $\textit{all}$ agents in the scenario, while in ad hoc teamwork, the learning algorithm usually assumes control over only a $\textit{single}$ agent in the scenario. However, many cooperative settings in the real world are much less restrictive. For example, in an autonomous driving scenario, a company might train its cars with the same learning algorithm, yet once on the road, these cars must cooperate with cars from another company. Towards expanding the class of scenarios that cooperative learning methods may optimally address, we introduce $N$-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where a set of autonomous agents must interact and cooperate with dynamically varying numbers and types of teammates. This paper formalizes the problem, and proposes the Policy Optimization with Agent Modelling (POAM) algorithm. POAM is a policy gradient, multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to the NAHT problem, that enables adaptation to diverse teammate behaviors by learning representations of teammate behaviors. Empirical evaluation on tasks from the multi-agent particle environment and StarCraft II shows that POAM improves cooperative task returns compared to baseline approaches, and enables out-of-distribution generalization to unseen teammates.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing popularity of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs), comes a need for more global explanations of model behaviors. Concept-based explanations arise as a promising avenue for explaining high-level patterns learned by LLMs. Yet their evaluation poses unique challenges, especially due to their non-local nature and high dimensional representation in a model's hidden space. Current methods approach concepts from different perspectives, lacking a unified formalization. This makes evaluating the core measures of concepts, namely faithfulness or readability, challenging. To bridge the gap, we introduce a formal definition of concepts generalizing to diverse concept-based explanations' settings. Based on this, we quantify the faithfulness of a concept explanation via perturbation. We ensure adequate perturbation in the high-dimensional space for different concepts via an optimization problem. Readability is approximated via an automatic and deterministic measure, quantifying the coherence of patterns that maximally activate a concept while aligning with human understanding. Finally, based on measurement theory, we apply a meta-evaluation method for evaluating these measures, generalizable to other types of explanations or tasks as well. Extensive experimental analysis has been conducted to inform the selection of explanation evaluation measures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangxu Yu, Lai Jiang, Haoqiang Kang, Shibo Hao, Lianhui Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to generate diverse solutions to a given problem is a hallmark of human creativity. This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning can improve LLM reasoning quality, but requires extensive supervised data to capture the full range of possible solutions. Reinforcement learning aims to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample diverse reasoning paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across five challenging puzzle-solving tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), and PrOntoQA (logical reasoning).

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ju-Seung Byun, Jiyun Chun, Jihyung Kil, Andrew Perrault</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel at comprehending human instructions and demonstrate remarkable results across a broad spectrum of tasks. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF) further refine LLMs by aligning them with specific preferences. These methods primarily use ranking-based feedback for entire generations. With advanced AI models (Teacher), such as GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, we can request various types of detailed feedback that are expensive for humans to provide. We propose a two-stage algorithm ARES that Alternates REinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). First, we request the Teacher to score how much each sentence contributes to solving the problem in a Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This sentence-level feedback allows us to consider individual valuable segments, providing more granular rewards for the RL procedure. Second, we ask the Teacher to correct the wrong reasoning after the RL stage. The RL procedure requires massive efforts for hyperparameter tuning and often generates errors like repetitive words and incomplete sentences. With the correction feedback, we stabilize the RL fine-tuned model through SFT. We conduct experiments on multi-model dataset ScienceQA and A-OKVQA to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. ARES rationale reasoning achieves around 70% win rate against baseline models judged by GPT-4o. Additionally, we observe that the improved rationale reasoning leads to a 2.5% increase in inference answer accuracy on average for the multi-modal datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jessica Echterhoff, Fartash Faghri, Raviteja Vemulapalli, Ting-Yao Hu, Chun-Liang Li, Oncel Tuzel, Hadi Pouransari</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are regularly updated to enhance performance, typically through changes in data or architecture. Within the update process, developers often prioritize improving overall performance metrics, paying less attention to maintaining compatibility with earlier model versions. Instance-level degradation (instance regression) of performance from one model version to the next can interfere with a user's mental model of the capabilities of a particular language model. Users having to adapt their mental model with every update can lead to dissatisfaction, especially when the new model has degraded compared to a prior version for a known use case (model update regression). We find that when pretrained LLM base models are updated, fine-tuned user-facing downstream task adapters experience negative flips -- previously correct instances are now predicted incorrectly. We observe model update regression between different model versions on a diverse set of tasks and models, even when the downstream task training procedures remain identical. We argue for the importance of maintaining model update compatibility during updates, and present evaluation metrics designed specifically for generative tasks, while also being applicable to discriminative tasks. We propose a training strategy to minimize the extent of instance regression in model updates, involving training of a compatibility adapter that can enhance task fine-tuned language models. We show negative flips reduce by up to 40% e.g. when updating Llama 1 to Llama 2 with our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: The deployment of language models brings challenges in generating reliable information, especially when these models are fine-tuned using human preferences. To extract encoded knowledge without (potentially) biased human labels, unsupervised probing techniques like Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) have been developed (Burns et al., 2022). However, salient but unrelated features in a given dataset can mislead these probes (Farquhar et al., 2023). Addressing this, we propose a cluster normalization method to minimize the impact of such features by clustering and normalizing activations of contrast pairs before applying unsupervised probing techniques. While this approach does not address the issue of differentiating between knowledge in general and simulated knowledge - a major issue in the literature of latent knowledge elicitation (Christiano et al., 2021) - it significantly improves the ability of unsupervised probes to identify the intended knowledge amidst distractions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-agent learning algorithms have been successful at generating superhuman planning in various games but have had limited impact on the design of deployed multi-agent planners. A key bottleneck in applying these techniques to multi-agent planning is that they require billions of steps of experience. To enable the study of multi-agent planning at scale, we present GPUDrive, a GPU-accelerated, multi-agent simulator built on top of the Madrona Game Engine that can generate over a million simulation steps per second. Observation, reward, and dynamics functions are written directly in C++, allowing users to define complex, heterogeneous agent behaviors that are lowered to high-performance CUDA. We show that using GPUDrive we can effectively train reinforcement learning agents over many scenes in the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, yielding highly effective goal-reaching agents in minutes for individual scenes and enabling agents to navigate thousands of scenarios within hours.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqicheng Zhu, Nico Potyka, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Bo Xiong, Yunjie He, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are often used to predict missing links for knowledge graphs (KGs). However, multiple KG embeddings can perform almost equally well for link prediction yet give conflicting predictions for unseen queries. This phenomenon is termed \textit{predictive multiplicity} in the literature. It poses substantial risks for KGE-based applications in high-stake domains but has been overlooked in KGE research. We define predictive multiplicity in link prediction, introduce evaluation metrics and measure predictive multiplicity for representative KGE methods on commonly used benchmark datasets. Our empirical study reveals significant predictive multiplicity in link prediction, with $8\%$ to $39\%$ testing queries exhibiting conflicting predictions. We address this issue by leveraging voting methods from social choice theory, significantly mitigating conflicts by $66\%$ to $78\%$ in our experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Fiaschi, Marco Cococcioni</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a novel approach to the deep hierarchical classification task, i.e., the problem of classifying data according to multiple labels organized in a rigid parent-child structure. It consists in a multi-output deep neural network equipped with specific projection operators placed before each output layer. The design of such an architecture, called lexicographic hybrid deep neural network (LH-DNN), has been possible by combining tools from different and quite distant research fields: lexicographic multi-objective optimization, non-standard analysis, and deep learning. To assess the efficacy of the approach, the resulting network is compared against the B-CNN, a convolutional neural network tailored for hierarchical classification tasks, on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (where it has been originally and recently proposed before being adopted and tuned for multiple real-world applications) and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. Evidence states that an LH-DNN can achieve comparable if not superior performance, especially in the learning of the hierarchical relations, in the face of a drastic reduction of the learning parameters, training epochs, and computational time, without the need for ad-hoc loss functions weighting values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingrui Gu, Guanren Qiao, Chuyi Jiang, Tianqing Xia, Hangyu Mao</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning encounters challenges in various environments related to robustness and explainability. Traditional Q-learning algorithms cannot effectively make decisions and utilize the historical learning experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cognitive Belief-Driven Q-Learning (CBDQ), which integrates subjective belief modeling into the Q-learning framework, enhancing decision-making accuracy by endowing agents with human-like learning and reasoning capabilities. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, our method maintains a subjective belief distribution over the expectation of actions, leveraging a cluster-based subjective belief model that enables agents to reason about the potential probability associated with each decision. CBDQ effectively mitigates overestimated phenomena and optimizes decision-making policies by integrating historical experiences with current contextual information, mimicking the dynamics of human decision-making. We evaluate the proposed method on discrete control benchmark tasks in various complicate environments. The results demonstrate that CBDQ exhibits stronger adaptability, robustness, and human-like characteristics in handling these environments, outperforming other baselines. We hope this work will give researchers a fresh perspective on understanding and explaining Q-learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanpeng Zhang, Zilong Xie, Yicheng Feng, Yijiang Li, Xingrun Xing, Sipeng Zheng, Zongqing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have made significant strides in integrating visual and textual information, yet they often struggle with effectively aligning these modalities. We introduce a novel image tokenizer that bridges this gap by applying the principle of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to visual data. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on separate visual encoders, our method directly incorporates structural prior information into image tokens, mirroring the successful tokenization strategies used in text-only Large Language Models. This innovative approach enables Transformer models to more effectively learn and reason across modalities. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BPE Image Tokenizer significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities, even with limited training data. Our method not only improves performance across various benchmarks but also shows promising scalability, potentially paving the way for more efficient and capable multimodal foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuo An, Yunjiao Zhou, Han Zou, Jianfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across textual and visual domains but often generate outputs that violate physical laws, revealing a gap in their understanding of the physical world. Inspired by human cognition, where perception is fundamental to reasoning, we explore augmenting LLMs with enhanced perception abilities using Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data and pertinent knowledge for IoT task reasoning in the physical world. In this work, we systematically study LLMs capability to address real-world IoT tasks by augmenting their perception and knowledge base, and then propose a unified framework, IoT-LLM, to enhance such capability. In IoT-LLM, we customize three steps for LLMs: preprocessing IoT data into formats amenable to LLMs, activating their commonsense knowledge through chain-of-thought prompting and specialized role definitions, and expanding their understanding via IoT-oriented retrieval-augmented generation based on in-context learning. To evaluate the performance, We design a new benchmark with five real-world IoT tasks with different data types and reasoning difficulties and provide the benchmarking results on six open-source and close-source LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the limitations of existing LLMs with naive textual inputs that cannot perform these tasks effectively. We show that IoT-LLM significantly enhances the performance of IoT tasks reasoning of LLM, such as GPT-4, achieving an average improvement of 65% across various tasks against previous methods. The results also showcase LLMs ability to comprehend IoT data and the physical law behind data by providing a reasoning process. Limitations of our work are claimed to inspire future research in this new era.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio LaTorre, Daniel Molina, Eneko Osaba, Javier Del Ser, Francisco Herrera</p>
<p>Abstract: Bio-inspired optimization (including Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence) is a growing research topic with many competitive bio-inspired algorithms being proposed every year. In such an active area, preparing a successful proposal of a new bio-inspired algorithm is not an easy task. Given the maturity of this research field, proposing a new optimization technique with innovative elements is no longer enough. Apart from the novelty, results reported by the authors should be proven to achieve a significant advance over previous outcomes from the state of the art. Unfortunately, not all new proposals deal with this requirement properly. Some of them fail to select appropriate benchmarks or reference algorithms to compare with. In other cases, the validation process carried out is not defined in a principled way (or is even not done at all). Consequently, the significance of the results presented in such studies cannot be guaranteed. In this work we review several recommendations in the literature and propose methodological guidelines to prepare a successful proposal, taking all these issues into account. We expect these guidelines to be useful not only for authors, but also for reviewers and editors along their assessment of new contributions to the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaniv Oren, Villiam Vadocz, Matthijs T. J. Spaan, Wendelin B\"ohmer</p>
<p>Abstract: The AlphaZero/MuZero (A/MZ) family of algorithms has achieved remarkable success across various challenging domains by integrating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with learned models. Learned models introduce epistemic uncertainty, which is caused by learning from limited data and is useful for exploration in sparse reward environments. MCTS does not account for the propagation of this uncertainty however. To address this, we introduce Epistemic MCTS (EMCTS): a theoretically motivated approach to account for the epistemic uncertainty in search and harness the search for deep exploration. In the challenging sparse-reward task of writing code in the Assembly language SUBLEQ, AZ paired with our method achieves significantly higher sample efficiency over baseline AZ. Search with EMCTS solves variations of the commonly used hard-exploration benchmark Deep Sea - which baseline A/MZ are practically unable to solve - much faster than an otherwise equivalent method that does not use search for uncertainty estimation, demonstrating significant benefits from search for epistemic uncertainty estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Desik Rengarajan, Nitin Ragothaman, Dileep Kalathil, Srinivas Shakkottai</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of federated offline reinforcement learning (RL), a scenario under which distributed learning agents must collaboratively learn a high-quality control policy only using small pre-collected datasets generated according to different unknown behavior policies. Na\"{i}vely combining a standard offline RL approach with a standard federated learning approach to solve this problem can lead to poorly performing policies. In response, we develop the Federated Ensemble-Directed Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (FEDORA), which distills the collective wisdom of the clients using an ensemble learning approach. We develop the FEDORA codebase to utilize distributed compute resources on a federated learning platform. We show that FEDORA significantly outperforms other approaches, including offline RL over the combined data pool, in various complex continuous control environments and real-world datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of FEDORA in the real-world on a mobile robot. We provide our code and a video of our experiments at \url{https://github.com/DesikRengarajan/FEDORA}.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time-Series Mining (TSM) is an important research area since it shows great potential in practical applications. Deep learning models that rely on massive labeled data have been utilized for TSM successfully. However, constructing a large-scale well-labeled dataset is difficult due to data annotation costs. Recently, pre-trained models have gradually attracted attention in the time series domain due to their remarkable performance in computer vision and natural language processing. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of Time-Series Pre-Trained Models (TS-PTMs), aiming to guide the understanding, applying, and studying TS-PTMs. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the typical deep learning models employed in TSM. Then, we give an overview of TS-PTMs according to the pre-training techniques. The main categories we explore include supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised TS-PTMs. Further, extensive experiments involving 27 methods, 434 datasets, and 679 transfer learning scenarios are conducted to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of transfer learning strategies, Transformer-based models, and representative TS-PTMs. Finally, we point out some potential directions of TS-PTMs for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Nguyen, Sid Wang, Ke Li, Carole-Jean Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale Transformers has led to the explosion of many AI applications across Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision tasks. However, fine-tuning all pre-trained model parameters becomes impractical as the model size and number of tasks increase. Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods aim to address these challenges. While effective in reducing the number of trainable parameters, PETL methods still require significant energy and computational resources to fine-tune. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{RE}current \textbf{AD}aption (READ) -- a lightweight and memory-efficient fine-tuning method -- to overcome the limitations of the current PETL approaches. Specifically, READ inserts a small RNN network alongside the backbone model so that the model does not have to back-propagate through the large backbone network. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation of the GLUE benchmark, we demonstrate READ can achieve a $56\%$ reduction in the training memory consumption and an $84\%$ reduction in the GPU energy usage while retraining high model quality compared to full-tuning. Additionally, the model size of READ does not grow with the backbone model size, making it a highly scalable solution for fine-tuning large Transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Xie, Wei Li, Xiangtai Li, Ziwei Liu, Yew Soon Ong, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: We present MosaicFusion, a simple yet effective diffusion-based data augmentation approach for large vocabulary instance segmentation. Our method is training-free and does not rely on any label supervision. Two key designs enable us to employ an off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model as a useful dataset generator for object instances and mask annotations. First, we divide an image canvas into several regions and perform a single round of diffusion process to generate multiple instances simultaneously, conditioning on different text prompts. Second, we obtain corresponding instance masks by aggregating cross-attention maps associated with object prompts across layers and diffusion time steps, followed by simple thresholding and edge-aware refinement processing. Without bells and whistles, our MosaicFusion can produce a significant amount of synthetic labeled data for both rare and novel categories. Experimental results on the challenging LVIS long-tailed and open-vocabulary benchmarks demonstrate that MosaicFusion can significantly improve the performance of existing instance segmentation models, especially for rare and novel categories.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Di Chang, Scott Fujimoto, David Meger, Gregory Dudek</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO) is a setting in which a learner tries to imitate the behavior of an expert, using only observational data and without the direct guidance of demonstrated actions. In this paper, we re-examine optimal transport for IL, in which a reward is generated based on the Wasserstein distance between the state trajectories of the learner and expert. We show that existing methods can be simplified to generate a reward function without requiring learned models or adversarial learning. Unlike many other state-of-the-art methods, our approach can be integrated with any RL algorithm and is amenable to ILfO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this simple approach on a variety of continuous control tasks and find that it surpasses the state of the art in the IlfO setting, achieving expert-level performance across a range of evaluation domains even when observing only a single expert trajectory without actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Han, Wenxuan Wu, Baturalp Buyukates, Weizhao Jin, Qifan Zhang, Yuhang Yao, Salman Avestimehr, Chaoyang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where malicious clients submit poisoned models to disrupt the convergence or plant backdoors that cause the global model to misclassify some samples. Current defense methods are often impractical for real-world FL systems, as they either rely on unrealistic prior knowledge or cause accuracy loss even in the absence of attacks. Furthermore, these methods lack a protocol for verifying execution, leaving participants uncertain about the correct execution of the mechanism. To address these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection strategy that is designed for real-world FL systems. Our approach activates the defense only when potential attacks are detected, and enables the removal of malicious models without affecting the benign ones. Additionally, we incorporate zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the integrity of the proposed defense mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing FL system security against a comprehensive set of adversarial attacks in various ML tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huihan Li, Yuting Ning, Zeyi Liao, Siyuan Wang, Xiang Lorraine Li, Ximing Lu, Wenting Zhao, Faeze Brahman, Yejin Choi, Xiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: To effectively use large language models (LLMs) for real-world queries, it is imperative that they generalize to the long-tail distribution, i.e. rare examples where models exhibit low confidence. In this work, we take the first step towards evaluating LLMs in the long-tail distribution of inferential knowledge. We exemplify long-tail evaluation on the Natural Language Inference task. First, we introduce Logic-Induced-Knowledge-Search (LINK), a systematic long-tail data generation framework, to obtain factually-correct yet long-tail inferential statements. LINK uses variable-wise prompting grounded on symbolic rules to seek low-confidence statements while ensuring factual correctness. We then use LINK to curate Logic-Induced-Long-Tail (LINT), a large-scale long-tail inferential knowledge dataset that contains 108K statements spanning four domains. We evaluate popular LLMs on LINT; we find that state-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance drop (21% relative drop for GPT4) on long-tail data as compared to on head distribution data, and smaller models show even more generalization weakness. These results further underscore the necessity of long-tail evaluation in developing generalizable LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Su, Junyi Jessy Li, Matthew Lease</p>
<p>Abstract: Can we preserve the accuracy of neural models while also providing faithful explanations of model decisions to training data? We propose a "wrapper box'' pipeline: training a neural model as usual and then using its learned feature representation in classic, interpretable models to perform prediction. Across seven language models of varying sizes, including four large language models (LLMs), two datasets at different scales, three classic models, and four evaluation metrics, we first show that the predictive performance of wrapper classic models is largely comparable to the original neural models.
  Because classic models are transparent, each model decision is determined by a known set of training examples that can be directly shown to users. Our pipeline thus preserves the predictive performance of neural language models while faithfully attributing classic model decisions to training data. Among other use cases, such attribution enables model decisions to be contested based on responsible training instances. Compared to prior work, our approach achieves higher coverage and correctness in identifying which training data to remove to change a model decision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenning Shi, Haoshuai Zheng, Chen Xu, Changsheng Dong, Bin Pan, Xueshuo Xie, Along He, Tao Li, Huazhu Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a powerful ability for text generation. However, achieving optimal results with a given prompt or instruction can be challenging, especially for billion-sized models. Additionally, undesired behaviors such as toxicity or hallucinations can manifest. While much larger models (e.g., ChatGPT) may demonstrate strength in mitigating these issues, there is still no guarantee of complete prevention. In this work, we propose formalizing text generation as a future-constrained generation problem to minimize undesirable behaviors and enforce faithfulness to instructions. The estimation of future constraint satisfaction, accomplished using LLMs, guides the text generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three distinct text generation tasks: keyword-constrained generation (Lin et al., 2020), toxicity reduction (Gehman et al., 2020), and factual correctness in question-answering (Gao et al., 2023).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Chen, Hongwei Wang, Sihao Chen, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Xinran Zhao, Hongming Zhang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense retrieval has become a prominent method to obtain relevant context or world knowledge in open-domain NLP tasks. When we use a learned dense retriever on a retrieval corpus at inference time, an often-overlooked design choice is the retrieval unit in which the corpus is indexed, e.g. document, passage, or sentence. We discover that the retrieval unit choice significantly impacts the performance of both retrieval and downstream tasks. Distinct from the typical approach of using passages or sentences, we introduce a novel retrieval unit, proposition, for dense retrieval. Propositions are defined as atomic expressions within text, each encapsulating a distinct factoid and presented in a concise, self-contained natural language format. We conduct an empirical comparison of different retrieval granularity. Our experiments reveal that indexing a corpus by fine-grained units such as propositions significantly outperforms passage-level units in retrieval tasks. Moreover, constructing prompts with fine-grained retrieved units for retrieval-augmented language models improves the performance of downstream QA tasks given a specific computation budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in planning and tool utilization as autonomous agents, but few have been developed for medical problem-solving. We propose EHRAgent, an LLM agent empowered with a code interface, to autonomously generate and execute code for multi-tabular reasoning within electronic health records (EHRs). First, we formulate an EHR question-answering task into a tool-use planning process, efficiently decomposing a complicated task into a sequence of manageable actions. By integrating interactive coding and execution feedback, EHRAgent learns from error messages and improves the originally generated code through iterations. Furthermore, we enhance the LLM agent by incorporating long-term memory, which allows EHRAgent to effectively select and build upon the most relevant successful cases from past experiences. Experiments on three real-world multi-tabular EHR datasets show that EHRAgent outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 29.6% in success rate. EHRAgent leverages the emerging few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs, enabling autonomous code generation and execution to tackle complex clinical tasks with minimal demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to exhibit a wide range of effective behaviors. Inspired by this principle, Quality-Diversity algorithms, such as MAP-Elites, are evolutionary methods designed to generate a set of diverse and high-fitness solutions. However, as a genetic algorithm, MAP-Elites relies on random mutations, which can become inefficient in high-dimensional search spaces, thus limiting its scalability to more complex domains, such as learning to control agents directly from high-dimensional inputs. To address this limitation, advanced methods like PGA-MAP-Elites and DCG-MAP-Elites have been developed, which combine actor-critic techniques from Reinforcement Learning with MAP-Elites, significantly enhancing the performance and efficiency of Quality-Diversity algorithms in complex, high-dimensional tasks. While these methods have successfully leveraged the trained critic to guide more effective mutations, the potential of the trained actor remains underutilized in improving both the quality and diversity of the evolved population. In this work, we introduce DCRL-MAP-Elites, an extension of DCG-MAP-Elites that utilizes the descriptor-conditioned actor as a generative model to produce diverse solutions, which are then injected into the offspring batch at each generation. Additionally, we present an empirical analysis of the fitness and descriptor reproducibility of the solutions discovered by each algorithm. Finally, we present a second empirical analysis shedding light on the synergies between the different variations operators and explaining the performance improvement from PGA-MAP-Elites to DCRL-MAP-Elites.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toni J. B. Liu, Nicolas Boull\'e, Rapha\"el Sarfati, Christopher J. Earls</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot tasks, including time-series forecasting. However, understanding the mechanisms behind such capabilities remains highly challenging due to the complexity of the models. We study LLMs' ability to extrapolate the behavior of dynamical systems whose evolution is governed by principles of physical interest. Our results show that LLaMA 2, a language model trained primarily on texts, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of neural scaling law. Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyue Hua, Xianjun Yang, Mingyu Jin, Zelong Li, Wei Cheng, Ruixiang Tang, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents shows great potential to revolutionize task planning, capturing significant attention. Given that these agents will be integrated into high-stake domains, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent's safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but also enhances the helpfulness of the agent. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the LLM reasoning ability in adhering to the Constitution. This paper sheds light on how to ensure the safe integration of LLM-based agents into human-centric environments. Data and code are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/TrustAgent.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing meta-parameters (i.e., hyperparameters) in machine learning algorithms, a critical factor influencing training efficiency and model performance. Moving away from the computationally expensive traditional meta-parameter search methods, we introduce MetaOptimize framework that dynamically adjusts meta-parameters, particularly step sizes (also known as learning rates), during training. More specifically, MetaOptimize can wrap around any first-order optimization algorithm, tuning step sizes on the fly to minimize a specific form of regret that accounts for long-term effect of step sizes on training, through a discounted sum of future losses. We also introduce low complexity variants of MetaOptimize that, in conjunction with its adaptability to multiple optimization algorithms, demonstrate performance competitive to those of best hand-crafted learning rate schedules across various machine learning applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feilong Jiang, Xiaonan Hou, Min Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Although physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown great potential in dealing with nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), it is common that PINNs will suffer from the problem of insufficient precision or obtaining incorrect outcomes. Unlike most of the existing solutions trying to enhance the ability of PINN by optimizing the training process, this paper improved the neural network architecture to improve the performance of PINN. We propose a densely multiply PINN (DM-PINN) architecture, which multiplies the output of a hidden layer with the outputs of all the behind hidden layers. Without introducing more trainable parameters, this effective mechanism can significantly improve the accuracy of PINNs. The proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark examples (Allan-Cahn equation, Helmholtz equation, Burgers equation and 1D convection equation). Comparisons between the proposed architecture and different PINN structures demonstrate the superior performance of the DM-PINN in both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Plaut, Hanlin Zhu, Stuart Russell</p>
<p>Abstract: Most learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees assume that no mistake is irreparable and essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors. This approach is problematic when some mistakes are \emph{catastrophic}, i.e., irreparable. We propose an online learning problem where the goal is to minimize the chance of catastrophe. Specifically, we assume that the payoff in each round represents the chance of avoiding catastrophe that round and aim to maximize the product of payoffs (the overall chance of avoiding catastrophe) while allowing a limited number of queries to a mentor. We first show that in general, any algorithm either constantly queries the mentor or is nearly guaranteed to cause catastrophe. However, in settings where the mentor policy class is learnable in the standard online learning model, we provide an algorithm whose regret and rate of querying the mentor both approach 0 as the time horizon grows. Conceptually, if a policy class is learnable in the absence of catastrophic risk, it is learnable in the presence of catastrophic risk if the agent can ask for help.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Ren, Biao Wu, Lingqiao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores an intriguing observation: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with responses generated by a LLM often yields better results than using responses generated by humans, particularly in reasoning tasks. We conduct an in-depth investigation to understand why this occurs. Contrary to the common belief that these instances is due to the more detailed nature of LLM-generated content, our study identifies another contributing factor: an LLM is inherently more "familiar" with LLM generated responses. This familiarity is evidenced by lower perplexity before fine-tuning. We design a series of experiments to understand the impact of the "familiarity" and our conclusion reveals that this "familiarity" significantly impacts learning performance. Training with LLM-generated responses not only enhances performance but also helps maintain the model's capabilities in other reasoning tasks after fine-tuning on a specific task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Ye, Andrew Wang, Jacob Choi, Yining Lu, Shreya Sharma, Lingfeng Shen, Vijay Tiyyala, Nicholas Andrews, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans regularly engage in analogical thinking, relating personal experiences to current situations (X is analogous to Y because of Z). Analogical thinking allows humans to solve problems in creative ways, grasp difficult concepts, and articulate ideas more effectively. Can language models (LMs) do the same? To answer this question, we propose AnaloBench, a benchmark to determine analogical reasoning ability in LMs. Our benchmarking approach focuses on aspects of this ability that are common among humans: (i) recalling related experiences from a large amount of information, and (ii) applying analogical reasoning to complex and lengthy scenarios. We test a broad collection of proprietary models (e.g., GPT family, Claude V2) and open source models such as LLaMA2. As in prior results, scaling up LMs results in some performance boosts. Surprisingly, scale offers minimal gains when, (i) analogies involve lengthy scenarios, or (ii) recalling relevant scenarios from a large pool of information, a process analogous to finding a needle in a haystack. We hope these observations encourage further research in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maksim Bobrin, Nazar Buzun, Dmitrii Krylov, Dmitry V. Dylov</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) addresses the problem of sequential decision-making by learning optimal policy through pre-collected data, without interacting with the environment. As yet, it has remained somewhat impractical, because one rarely knows the reward explicitly and it is hard to distill it retrospectively. Here, we show that an imitating agent can still learn the desired behavior merely from observing the expert, despite the absence of explicit rewards or action labels. In our method, AILOT (Aligned Imitation Learning via Optimal Transport), we involve special representation of states in a form of intents that incorporate pairwise spatial distances within the data. Given such representations, we define intrinsic reward function via optimal transport distance between the expert's and the agent's trajectories. We report that AILOT outperforms state-of-the art offline imitation learning algorithms on D4RL benchmarks and improves the performance of other offline RL algorithms by dense reward relabelling in the sparse-reward tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Plaut, Nguyen X. Khanh, Tu Trinh</p>
<p>Abstract: We study 14 large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for chat and find that their maximum softmax probabilities (MSPs) are consistently miscalibrated on multiple-choice Q&A. However, those MSPs might still encode useful uncertainty information. Specifically, we hypothesized that wrong answers would be associated with smaller MSPs compared to correct answers. Via rigororous statistical testing, we show that this hypothesis holds for models which perform well on the underlying Q&A task. We also find a strong direction correlation between Q&A accuracy and MSP correctness prediction, while finding no correlation between Q&A accuracy and calibration error. This suggests that within the current fine-tuning paradigm, we can expect correctness prediction but not calibration to improve as LLM capabilities progress. To demonstrate the utility of correctness prediction, we show that when models have the option to abstain, performance can be improved by selectively abstaining based on the MSP of the initial model response, using only a small amount of labeled data to choose the MSP threshold.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng-Xin Yong, Cristina Menghini, Stephen H. Bach</p>
<p>Abstract: Data scarcity in low-resource languages can be addressed with word-to-word translations from labeled task data in high-resource languages using bilingual lexicons. However, bilingual lexicons often have limited lexical overlap with task data, which results in poor translation coverage and lexicon utilization. We propose lexicon-conditioned data generation LexC-Gen, a method that generates low-resource-language classification task data at scale. Specifically, LexC-Gen first uses high-resource-language words from bilingual lexicons to generate lexicon-compatible task data, and then it translates them into low-resource languages with bilingual lexicons via word translation. Across 17 extremely low-resource languages, LexC-Gen generated data is competitive with expert-translated gold data, and yields on average 5.6 and 8.9 points improvement over existing lexicon-based word translation methods on sentiment analysis and topic classification tasks respectively. Through ablation study, we show that conditioning on bilingual lexicons is the key component of LexC-Gen. LexC-Gen serves as a potential solution to close the performance gap between open-source multilingual models, such as BLOOMZ and Aya-101, and state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o on low-resource-language tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Gu, Yiheng Shu, Hao Yu, Xiao Liu, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Jayanth Srinivasa, Hugo Latapie, Yu Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) have expanded well beyond the confines of text processing, signaling a new era where LLMs are envisioned as generalist agents capable of operating within complex environments. These environments are often highly expansive, making it impossible for the LLM to process them within its short-term memory. Motivated by recent research on extending the capabilities of LLMs with tools, we seek to investigate the intriguing potential of tools to augment LLMs in handling such complexity by introducing a novel class of tools, termed middleware, to aid in the proactive exploration within these massive environments. Such specialized tools can serve as a middleware layer shielding the LLM from environmental complexity. In two representative complex environments -- knowledge bases (KBs) and databases -- we demonstrate the significant potential of augmenting language agents with tools in complex environments. Notably, equipped with the middleware, GPT-4 achieves 2.8X the performance of the best baseline in tasks requiring access to database content and 2.2X in KB tasks. Our findings illuminate the path for advancing language agents in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant, Pedro Rodriguez, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Patrick Lewis</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense retrievers compress source documents into (possibly lossy) vector representations, yet there is little analysis of what information is lost versus preserved, and how it affects downstream tasks. We conduct the first analysis of the information captured by dense retrievers compared to the language models they are based on (e.g., BERT versus Contriever). We use 25 MultiBert checkpoints as randomized initialisations to train MultiContrievers, a set of 25 contriever models. We test whether specific pieces of information -- such as gender and occupation -- can be extracted from contriever vectors of wikipedia-like documents. We measure this extractability via information theoretic probing. We then examine the relationship of extractability to performance and gender bias, as well as the sensitivity of these results to many random initialisations and data shuffles. We find that (1) contriever models have significantly increased extractability, but extractability usually correlates poorly with benchmark performance 2) gender bias is present, but is not caused by the contriever representations 3) there is high sensitivity to both random initialisation and to data shuffle, suggesting that future retrieval research should test across a wider spread of both.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to be aligned with human expectations to ensure their safety and utility in most applications. Alignment is challenging, costly, and needs to be repeated for every LLM and alignment criterion. We propose to decouple LLMs and alignment by training aligner models that can be used to align any LLM for a given criteria on an as-needed basis, thus also reducing the potential negative impacts of alignment on performance. Our recipe for training the aligner models solely relies on synthetic data generated with a (prompted) LLM and can be easily adjusted for a variety of alignment criteria. We use the same synthetic data to train inspectors, binary miss-alignment classification models to guide a "squad" of multiple aligners. Our empirical results demonstrate consistent improvements when applying aligner squad to various LLMs, including chat-aligned models, across several instruction-following and red-teaming datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social simulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena. However, most recent work has used a more omniscient perspective on these simulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is fundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric interactions that involve humans and AI agents in the real world. To examine these differences, we develop an evaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various settings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that LLMs perform better in unrealistic, omniscient simulation settings but struggle in ones that more accurately reflect real-world conditions with information asymmetry. Our findings indicate that addressing information asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conditional diffusion models can create unseen images in various settings, aiding image interpolation. Interpolation in latent spaces is well-studied, but interpolation with specific conditions like text or poses is less understood. Simple approaches, such as linear interpolation in the space of conditions, often result in images that lack consistency, smoothness, and fidelity. To that end, we introduce a novel training-free technique named Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (AID). Our key contributions include 1) proposing an inner/outer interpolated attention layer; 2) fusing the interpolated attention with self-attention to boost fidelity; and 3) applying beta distribution to selection to increase smoothness. We also present a variant, Prompt-guided Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (PAID), that considers interpolation as a condition-dependent generative process. This method enables the creation of new images with greater consistency, smoothness, and efficiency, and offers control over the exact path of interpolation. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness for conceptual and spatial interpolation. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/QY-H00/attention-interpolation-diffusion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baolong Bi, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Junfeng Fang, Hongcheng Gao, Shiyu Ni, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: As the modern tools of choice for text understanding and generation, large language models (LLMs) are expected to accurately output answers by leveraging the input context. This requires LLMs to possess both context-faithfulness and factual accuracy. Extensive efforts have been made to enable better outputs from LLMs by mitigating hallucinations through factuality enhancement methods. However, they also pose risks of hindering context-faithfulness, as factuality enhancement can lead LLMs to become overly confident in their parametric knowledge, causing them to overlook the relevant input context. In this work, we argue that current factuality enhancement methods can significantly undermine the context-faithfulness of LLMs. We first revisit the current factuality enhancement methods and evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing factual accuracy. Next, we evaluate their performance on knowledge editing tasks to assess the potential impact on context-faithfulness. The experimental results reveal that while these methods may yield inconsistent improvements in factual accuracy, they also cause a more severe decline in context-faithfulness, with the largest decrease reaching a striking 69.7\%. To explain these declines, we analyze the hidden states and logit distributions for the tokens representing new knowledge and parametric knowledge respectively, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Our finding highlights the complex trade-offs inherent in enhancing LLMs. Therefore, we recommend that more research on LLMs' factuality enhancement make efforts to reduce the sacrifice of context-faithfulness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and nearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenhailong Wang, Joy Hsu, Xingyao Wang, Kuan-Hao Huang, Manling Li, Jiajun Wu, Heng Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josua Spisak, Matthias Kerzel, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots can benefit from their similarity to the human shape by learning from humans. When humans teach other humans how to perform actions, they often demonstrate the actions, and the learning human imitates the demonstration to get an idea of how to perform the action. Being able to mentally transfer from a demonstration seen from a third-person perspective to how it should look from a first-person perspective is fundamental for this ability in humans. As this is a challenging task, it is often simplified for robots by creating demonstrations from the first-person perspective. Creating these demonstrations allows for an easier imitation but requires more effort. Therefore, we introduce a novel diffusion model that enables the robot to learn from the third-person demonstrations directly by learning to generate the first-person perspective from the third-person perspective. The model translates the size and rotations of objects and the environment between the two perspectives. This allows us to utilise the benefits of easy-to-produce third-person demonstrations and easy-to-imitate first-person demonstrations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishabh Ranjan, Saurabh Garg, Mrigank Raman, Carlos Guestrin, Zachary Lipton</p>
<p>Abstract: Trained models are often composed with post-hoc transforms such as temperature scaling (TS), ensembling and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improve performance, robustness, uncertainty estimation, etc. However, such transforms are typically applied only after the base models have already been finalized by standard means. In this paper, we challenge this practice with an extensive empirical study. In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we call post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applying post-hoc transforms. This phenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise settings. For example, while base models overfit badly early in training, both ensembling and SWA favor base models trained for more epochs. Post-hoc reversal can also prevent the appearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and test error seen in base models. Preliminary analyses suggest that these transforms induce reversal by suppressing the influence of mislabeled examples, exploiting differences in their learning dynamics from those of clean examples. Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, a simple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions such as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices. Our experiments span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasets. On an LLM instruction tuning dataset, post-hoc selection results in >1.5x MMLU improvement compared to naive selection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Cahyawijaya, Delong Chen, Yejin Bang, Leila Khalatbari, Bryan Wilie, Ziwei Ji, Etsuko Ishii, Pascale Fung</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various tasks and fields has necessitated the alignment of these models with human values and preferences. Given various approaches of human value alignment, ranging from Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), to constitutional learning, etc. there is an urgent need to understand the scope and nature of human values injected into these models before their release. There is also a need for model alignment without a costly large scale human annotation effort. We propose UniVaR, a high-dimensional representation of human value distributions in LLMs, orthogonal to model architecture and training data. Trained from the value-relevant output of eight multilingual LLMs and tested on the output from four multilingual LLMs, namely LlaMA2, ChatGPT, JAIS and Yi, we show that UniVaR is a powerful tool to compare the distribution of human values embedded in different LLMs with different langauge sources. Through UniVaR, we explore how different LLMs prioritize various values in different languages and cultures, shedding light on the complex interplay between human values and language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunny Sanyal, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Sujay Sanghavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks, primarily due to the transformer architecture and its self-attention mechanism. However, we observe that in standard decoder-style LLMs, attention matrices degenerate to single-column for deeper layers. Layers in this state are unable to learn anything meaningful and mostly redundant; we refer to these as lazy layers. The goal of this paper is to train smaller models by eliminating this structural inefficiency without compromising performance.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose Inheritune, a simple yet effective training recipe for developing smaller, high-performing language models. Smaller models trained with Inheritune, inherit early transformer layers from a larger pre-trained model, then retrain and progressively expand until they match or exceed the performance of the larger model. We demonstrate that Inheritune enables the training of various sizes of GPT-2 models on datasets like OpenWebText-9B and FineWeb_edu. Models trained with Inheritune, despite having significantly fewer layers, match or even surpass the performance of their larger counterparts. For instance, our 16-layer GPT-2 medium variant achieves comparable performance to the standard 24-layer GPT-2 medium model. Code is available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/LLM-Inheritune.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubin Kim, Chanwoo Park, Hyewon Jeong, Yik Siu Chan, Xuhai Xu, Daniel McDuff, Hyeonhoon Lee, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Cynthia Breazeal, Hae Won Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models are becoming valuable tools in medicine. Yet despite their promise, the best way to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex medical tasks remains an open question. We introduce a novel multi-agent framework, named Medical Decision-making Agents (MDAgents) that helps address this gap by automatically assigning a collaboration structure to a team of LLMs. The assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the medical task at hand, emulating real-world medical decision-making processes adapted to tasks of varying complexities. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world medical knowledge and medical diagnosis benchmarks. MDAgents achieved the best performance in seven out of ten benchmarks on tasks requiring an understanding of medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a significant improvement of up to 6.5% (p < 0.05) compared to previous methods' best performances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines medical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse medical tasks. Notably, the combination of moderator review and external medical knowledge in group collaboration resulted in an average accuracy improvement of 11.8%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanshuo Liu, Bo Chen, Menghui Zhu, Jianghao Lin, Jiarui Qin, Yang Yang, Hao Zhang, Ruiming Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for personalized online services. Sample-level retrieval-based models, such as RIM, have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, they face challenges including inference inefficiency and high resource consumption due to the retrieval process, which hinder their practical application in industrial settings. To address this, we propose a universal plug-and-play \underline{r}etrieval-\underline{o}riented \underline{k}nowledge (\textbf{\name}) framework that bypasses the real retrieval process. The framework features a knowledge base that preserves and imitates the retrieved \& aggregated representations using a decomposition-reconstruction paradigm. Knowledge distillation and contrastive learning optimize the knowledge base, enabling the integration of retrieval-enhanced representations with various CTR models. Experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate \name's exceptional compatibility and performance, with the neural knowledge base serving as an effective surrogate for the retrieval pool. \name surpasses the teacher model while maintaining superior inference efficiency and demonstrates the feasibility of distilling knowledge from non-parametric methods using a parametric approach. These results highlight \name's strong potential for real-world applications and its ability to transform retrieval-based methods into practical solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arsalan Sharifnassab, Saber Salehkaleybar, Sina Ghiassian, Surya Kanoria, Dale Schuurmans</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Soft Preference Optimization (SPO), a method for aligning generative models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with human preferences, without the need for a reward model. SPO optimizes model outputs directly over a preference dataset through a natural loss function that integrates preference loss with a regularization term across the model's entire output distribution rather than limiting it to the preference dataset. Although SPO does not require the assumption of an existing underlying reward model, we demonstrate that, under the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, it converges to a softmax of scaled rewards, with the distribution's "softness" adjustable via the softmax exponent, an algorithm parameter. We showcase SPO's methodology, its theoretical foundation, and its comparative advantages in simplicity, computational efficiency, and alignment precision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Shi, Ran Xu, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Haotian Sun, Hang Wu, Carl Yang, May D. Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their improved capabilities in generation and reasoning, adapting large language models (LLMs) to the biomedical domain remains challenging due to their immense size and corporate privacy. In this work, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and 11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing adaptation methods. Faced with the challenges of balancing model performance, computational resources, and data privacy, MedAdapter provides an efficient, privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and transparent solution for adapting LLMs to the biomedical domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joo Young Choi, Jaesung R. Park, Inkyu Park, Jaewoong Cho, Albert No, Ernest K. Ryu</p>
<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art diffusion models employ U-Net architectures containing convolutional and (qkv) self-attention layers. The U-Net processes images while being conditioned on the time embedding input for each sampling step and the class or caption embedding input corresponding to the desired conditional generation. Such conditioning involves scale-and-shift operations to the convolutional layers but does not directly affect the attention layers. While these standard architectural choices are certainly effective, not conditioning the attention layers feels arbitrary and potentially suboptimal. In this work, we show that simply adding LoRA conditioning to the attention layers without changing or tuning the other parts of the U-Net architecture improves the image generation quality. For example, a drop-in addition of LoRA conditioning to EDM diffusion model yields FID scores of 1.91/1.75 for unconditional and class-conditional CIFAR-10 generation, improving upon the baseline of 1.97/1.79.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have achieved promising performances across various applications. Nonetheless, the ongoing challenge of integrating long-tail knowledge continues to impede the seamless adoption of LLMs in specialized domains. In this work, we introduce DALK, a.k.a. Dynamic Co-Augmentation of LLMs and KG, to address this limitation and demonstrate its ability on studying Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a specialized sub-field in biomedicine and a global health priority. With a synergized framework of LLM and KG mutually enhancing each other, we first leverage LLM to construct an evolving AD-specific knowledge graph (KG) sourced from AD-related scientific literature, and then we utilize a coarse-to-fine sampling method with a novel self-aware knowledge retrieval approach to select appropriate knowledge from the KG to augment LLM inference capabilities. The experimental results, conducted on our constructed AD question answering (ADQA) benchmark, underscore the efficacy of DALK. Additionally, we perform a series of detailed analyses that can offer valuable insights and guidelines for the emerging topic of mutually enhancing KG and LLM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takuya Hiraoka, Guanquan Wang, Takashi Onishi, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) with experience replay, experiences stored in a replay buffer influence the RL agent's performance. Information about how these experiences influence the agent's performance is valuable for various purposes, such as identifying experiences that negatively influence underperforming agents. One method for estimating the influence of experiences is the leave-one-out (LOO) method. However, this method is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we present Policy Iteration with Turn-over Dropout (PIToD), which efficiently estimates the influence of experiences. We evaluate how accurately PIToD estimates the influence of experiences and its efficiency compared to LOO. We then apply PIToD to amend underperforming RL agents, i.e., we use PIToD to estimate negatively influential experiences for the RL agents and to delete the influence of these experiences. We show that RL agents' performance is significantly improved via amendments with PIToD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Hu, Chenyang Ren, Zhengyu Hu, Hongbin Lin, Cheng-Long Wang, Hui Xiong, Jingfeng Zhang, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a human-understandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on cases where the data, including concepts, are clean. In many scenarios, we always need to remove/insert some training data or new concepts from trained CBMs due to different reasons, such as privacy concerns, data mislabelling, spurious concepts, and concept annotation errors. Thus, the challenge of deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch persists, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Editable Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Specifically, ECBMs support three different levels of data removal: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level. ECBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for re-training. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our ECBMs, affirming their adaptability within the realm of CBMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution for mitigating hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) with retrieved external knowledge. Adaptive RAG enhances this approach by enabling dynamic retrieval during generation, activating retrieval only when the query exceeds LLM's internal knowledge. Existing methods primarily focus on detecting LLM's confidence via statistical uncertainty. Instead, we present the first attempts to solve adaptive RAG from a representation perspective and develop an inherent control-based framework, termed \name. Specifically, we extract the features that represent the honesty and confidence directions of LLM and adopt them to control LLM behavior and guide retrieval timing decisions. We also design a simple yet effective query formulation strategy to support adaptive retrieval. Experiments show that \name is superior to existing adaptive RAG methods on a diverse set of tasks, the honesty steering can effectively make LLMs more honest and confidence monitoring is a promising indicator of retrieval trigger.Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/HSLiu-Initial/CtrlA}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Zhao, Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Nicolas Flammarion</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to learn from examples without changing their weights: this is a particularly promising capability for long-context LLMs that can potentially learn from many examples. Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance. In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on the established benchmark MT-Bench, especially with more capable base LLMs. We then uncover the most relevant elements for successful in-context alignment, finding the crucial role of the decoding parameters. Based on these insights, we show that the approach of URIAL can indeed be improved by adding high-quality, potentially carefully selected via greedy search, demonstrations in context, getting closer to the performance of instruct models. Finally, we provide the first, to our knowledge, systematic comparison of ICL and instruction fine-tuning (IFT) for instruction following in the low data regime, where ICL can be a viable alternative to IFT. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique and its relationship to IFT. We provide our code at https://github.com/tml-epfl/icl-alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LInK, a novel framework that integrates contrastive learning of performance and design space with optimization techniques for solving complex inverse problems in engineering design with discrete and continuous variables. We focus on the path synthesis problem for planar linkage mechanisms. By leveraging a multimodal and transformation-invariant contrastive learning framework, LInK learns a joint representation that captures complex physics and design representations of mechanisms, enabling rapid retrieval from a vast dataset of over 10 million mechanisms. This approach improves precision through the warm start of a hierarchical unconstrained nonlinear optimization algorithm, combining the robustness of traditional optimization with the speed and adaptability of modern deep learning methods. Our results on an existing benchmark demonstrate that LInK outperforms existing methods with 28 times less error compared to a state of the art approach while taking 20 times less time on an existing benchmark. Moreover, we introduce a significantly more challenging benchmark, named LINK ABC, which involves synthesizing linkages that trace the trajectories of English capital alphabets, an inverse design benchmark task that existing methods struggle with due to large nonlinearities and tiny feasible space. Our results demonstrate that LInK not only advances the field of mechanism design but also broadens the applicability of contrastive learning and optimization to other areas of engineering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyang Xu, Shujin Wu, Shizhe Diao, Xiaoze Liu, Xingyao Wang, Yangyi Chen, Jing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate or fabricated information and generally fail to indicate their confidence, which limits their broader applications. Previous work elicits confidence from LLMs by direct or self-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised finetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the training-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level confidence estimates. In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a training framework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidence estimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the process of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly identify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This is achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in specific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the analysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the resulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize reinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate the confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence predictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental results in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and maintaining the task performance. We show that the generated self-reflective rationales are reasonable and can further contribute to the calibration. The code is made public at https://github.com/xu1868/SaySelf.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohan Meng, Zaiqiao Meng, Ke Yuan, Iadh Ounis</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed a growing need for human-AI collaboration, especially in creative decision-making scenarios where trust and reliance are paramount. Through human studies and model evaluations on the open-ended News Headline Generation task from the LaMP benchmark, we analyze how the framing and presence of explanations affect user trust and model performance. Overall, we provide evidence that adding an explanation in the model response to justify its reasoning significantly increases self-reported user trust in the model when the user has the opportunity to compare various responses. Position and faithfulness of these explanations are also important factors. However, these gains disappear when users are shown responses independently, suggesting that humans trust all model responses, including deceptive ones, equitably when they are shown in isolation. Our findings urge future research to delve deeper into the nuanced evaluation of trust in human-machine teaming systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David R Wessels, David M Knigge, Samuele Papa, Riccardo Valperga, Sharvaree Vadgama, Efstratios Gavves, Erik J Bekkers</p>
<p>Abstract: Conditional Neural Fields (CNFs) are increasingly being leveraged as continuous signal representations, by associating each data-sample with a latent variable that conditions a shared backbone Neural Field (NeF) to reconstruct the sample. However, existing CNF architectures face limitations when using this latent downstream in tasks requiring fine grained geometric reasoning, such as classification and segmentation. We posit that this results from lack of explicit modelling of geometric information (e.g. locality in the signal or the orientation of a feature) in the latent space of CNFs. As such, we propose Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs), a novel CNF architecture which uses a geometry-informed cross-attention to condition the NeF on a geometric variable, a latent point cloud of features, that enables an equivariant decoding from latent to field. We show that this approach induces a steerability property by which both field and latent are grounded in geometry and amenable to transformation laws: if the field transforms, the latent representation transforms accordingly - and vice versa. Crucially, this equivariance relation ensures that the latent is capable of (1) representing geometric patterns faitfhully, allowing for geometric reasoning in latent space, (2) weight-sharing over similar local patterns, allowing for efficient learning of datasets of fields. We validate these main properties in a range of tasks including classification, segmentation, forecasting and reconstruction, showing clear improvement over baselines with a geometry-free latent space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zile Qiao, Wei Ye, Yong Jiang, Tong Mo, Pengjun Xie, Weiping Li, Fei Huang, Shikun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have recently shown great potential in mitigating the limitations of implicit knowledge in LLMs, such as untimely updating of the latest expertise and unreliable retention of long-tail knowledge. However, since the external knowledge base, as well as the retriever, can not guarantee reliability, potentially leading to the knowledge retrieved not being helpful or even misleading for LLM generation. In this paper, we introduce Supportiveness-based Knowledge Rewriting (SKR), a robust and pluggable knowledge rewriter inherently optimized for LLM generation. Specifically, we introduce the novel concept of "supportiveness"--which represents how effectively a knowledge piece facilitates downstream tasks--by considering the perplexity impact of augmented knowledge on the response text of a white-box LLM. Based on knowledge supportiveness, we first design a training data curation strategy for our rewriter model, effectively identifying and filtering out poor or irrelevant rewrites (e.g., with low supportiveness scores) to improve data efficacy. We then introduce the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm to align the generated rewrites to optimal supportiveness, guiding the rewriter model to summarize augmented content that better improves the final response. Comprehensive evaluations across six popular knowledge-intensive tasks and four LLMs have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of SKR. With only 7B parameters, SKR has shown better knowledge rewriting capability over GPT-4, the current state-of-the-art general-purpose LLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Schr\"oder, Gerhard Heyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Active learning is an iterative labeling process that is used to obtain a small labeled subset, despite the absence of labeled data, thereby enabling to train a model for supervised tasks such as text classification. While active learning has made considerable progress in recent years due to improvements provided by pre-trained language models, there is untapped potential in the often neglected unlabeled portion of the data, although it is available in considerably larger quantities than the usually small set of labeled data. In this work, we investigate how self-training, a semi-supervised approach that uses a model to obtain pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, can be used to improve the efficiency of active learning for text classification. Building on a comprehensive reproduction of four previous self-training approaches, some of which are evaluated for the first time in the context of active learning or natural language processing, we introduce HAST, a new and effective self-training strategy, which is evaluated on four text classification benchmarks. Our results show that it outperforms the reproduced self-training approaches and reaches classification results comparable to previous experiments for three out of four datasets, using as little as 25% of the data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Xu, Fan Liu, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in executing complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks and can be manipulated to produce harmful outputs. Recently, a growing body of research has categorized jailbreak attacks into token-level and prompt-level attacks. However, previous work primarily overlooks the diverse key factors of jailbreak attacks, with most studies concentrating on LLM vulnerabilities and lacking exploration of defense-enhanced LLMs. To address these issues, we evaluate the impact of various attack settings on LLM performance and provide a baseline benchmark for jailbreak attacks, encouraging the adoption of a standardized evaluation framework. Specifically, we evaluate the eight key factors of implementing jailbreak attacks on LLMs from both target-level and attack-level perspectives. We further conduct seven representative jailbreak attacks on six defense methods across two widely used datasets, encompassing approximately 354 experiments with about 55,000 GPU hours on A800-80G. Our experimental results highlight the need for standardized benchmarking to evaluate these attacks on defense-enhanced LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Bag_of_Tricks_for_LLM_Jailbreaking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Zur, Elisa Kreiss, Karel D'Oosterlinck, Christopher Potts, Atticus Geiger</p>
<p>Abstract: Although CLIPScore is a powerful generic metric that captures the similarity between a text and an image, it fails to distinguish between a caption that is meant to complement the information in an image and a description that is meant to replace an image entirely, e.g., for accessibility. We address this shortcoming by updating the CLIP model with the Concadia dataset to assign higher scores to descriptions than captions using parameter efficient fine-tuning and a loss objective derived from work on causal interpretability. This model correlates with the judgements of blind and low-vision people while preserving transfer capabilities and has interpretable structure that sheds light on the caption--description distinction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Jiang, Yangxinyu Xie, Zhuoqun Hao, Xiaomeng Wang, Tanwi Mallick, Weijie J. Su, Camillo J. Taylor, Dan Roth</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces a hypothesis-testing framework to assess whether large language models (LLMs) possess genuine reasoning abilities or primarily depend on token bias. We go beyond evaluating LLMs on accuracy; rather, we aim to investigate their token bias in solving logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, we develop carefully controlled synthetic datasets, featuring conjunction fallacy and syllogistic problems. Our framework outlines a list of hypotheses where token biases are readily identifiable, with all null hypotheses assuming genuine reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The findings in this study suggest, with statistical guarantee, that most LLMs still struggle with logical reasoning. While they may perform well on classic problems, their success largely depends on recognizing superficial patterns with strong token bias, thereby raising concerns about their actual reasoning and generalization abilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihuai Hong, Lei Yu, Haiqin Yang, Shauli Ravfogel, Mor Geva</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of "unlearning" certain concepts in large language models (LLMs) has attracted immense attention recently, due to its importance in mitigating undesirable model behaviours, such as the generation of harmful, private, or incorrect information. Current protocols to evaluate unlearning methods largely rely on behavioral tests, without monitoring the presence of unlearned knowledge within the model's parameters. This residual knowledge can be adversarially exploited to recover the erased information post-unlearning. We argue that unlearning should also be evaluated internally, by considering changes in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. To this end, we propose a general evaluation methodology that leverages vocabulary projections to inspect concepts encoded in model parameters. We use this approach to localize "concept vectors" - parameter vectors that encode concrete concepts - and construct ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing hundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two open-source LLMs. Evaluation on ConceptVectors shows that existing unlearning methods minimally impact concept vectors and mostly suppress them during inference, while directly ablating these vectors demonstrably removes the associated knowledge and significantly reduces the model's susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Our results highlight limitations in behavioral-based unlearning evaluations and call for future work to include parameter-based evaluations. To support this, we release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/yihuaihong/ConceptVectors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenxuan Zhou, Ravi Agrawal, Shujian Zhang, Sathish Reddy Indurthi, Sanqiang Zhao, Kaiqiang Song, Silei Xu, Chenguang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a promising solution to align large language models (LLMs) more closely with human values. Off-policy preference optimization, where the preference data is obtained from other models, is widely adopted due to its cost efficiency and scalability. However, off-policy preference optimization often suffers from a distributional gap between the policy used for data collection and the target policy, leading to suboptimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this problem by simulating on-policy learning with off-policy preference data. Our Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) method adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. This method not only addresses the distributional gap problem but also enhances the optimization process without incurring additional costs. We validate our method on instruction following benchmarks including Alpaca Eval 2 and MT-bench. WPO not only outperforms Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 5.6% on Alpaca Eval 2 but also establishes a remarkable length-controlled winning rate against GPT-4-turbo of 76.7% based on Gemma-2-9b-it.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yebowen Hu, Kaiqiang Song, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenlin Yao, Hassan Foroosh, Dong Yu, Fei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning is most powerful when an LLM accurately aggregates relevant information. We examine the critical role of information aggregation in reasoning by requiring the LLM to analyze sports narratives. To succeed at this task, an LLM must infer points from actions, identify related entities, attribute points accurately to players and teams, and compile key statistics to draw conclusions. We conduct comprehensive experiments with real NBA basketball data and present SportsGen, a new method to synthesize game narratives. By synthesizing data, we can rigorously evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities under complex scenarios with varying narrative lengths and density of information. Our findings show that most models, including GPT-4o, often fail to accurately aggregate basketball scores due to frequent scoring patterns. Open-source models like Llama-3 further suffer from significant score hallucinations. Finally, the effectiveness of reasoning is influenced by narrative complexity, information density, and domain-specific terms, highlighting the challenges in analytical reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenda Xu, Jiachen Li, William Yang Wang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) has emerged as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) to human desiderata from pre-collected, offline preference datasets. While recent studies indicate that existing offline DAP methods can directly benefit from online training samples, we highlight the need to develop specific online DAP algorithms to fully harness the power of online training. Specifically, we identify that the learned LLM should adhere to the proximity of the behavior LLM, which collects the training samples. To this end, we propose online Preference Optimization in proximity to the Behavior LLM (BPO), emphasizing the importance of constructing a proper trust region for LLM alignment.
  We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach by integrating it with various DAP methods, resulting in significant performance improvements across a wide range of tasks when training with the same amount of preference data. Even when only introducing one additional data collection phase, our online BPO improves its offline DAP baseline from 72.0% to 80.2% on TL;DR and from 82.2% to 89.1% on Anthropic Helpfulness in terms of win rate against human reference text.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Merrill, Noah A. Smith, Yanai Elazar</p>
<p>Abstract: How novel are texts generated by language models (LMs) relative to their training corpora? In this work, we investigate the extent to which modern LMs generate $n$-grams from their training data, evaluating both (i) the probability LMs assign to complete training $n$-grams and (ii) $n$-novelty, the proportion of $n$-grams generated by an LM that did not appear in the training data (for arbitrarily large $n$). To enable arbitrary-length $n$-gram search over a corpus in constant time w.r.t. corpus size, we develop Rusty-DAWG, a novel search tool inspired by indexing of genomic data. We compare the novelty of LM-generated text to human-written text and explore factors that affect generation novelty, focusing on the Pythia models. We find that, for $n > 4$, LM-generated text is less novel than human-written text, though it is more novel for smaller $n$. Larger LMs and more constrained decoding strategies both decrease novelty. Finally, we show that LMs complete $n$-grams with lower loss if they are more frequent in the training data. Overall, our results reveal factors influencing the novelty of LM-generated text, and we release Rusty-DAWG to facilitate further pretraining data research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kawshik Manikantan, Shubham Toshniwal, Makarand Tapaswi, Vineet Gandhi</p>
<p>Abstract: The limited generalization of coreference resolution (CR) models has been a major bottleneck in the task's broad application. Prior work has identified annotation differences, especially for mention detection, as one of the main reasons for the generalization gap and proposed using additional annotated target domain data. Rather than relying on this additional annotation, we propose an alternative referential task, Major Entity Identification (MEI), where we: (a) assume the target entities to be specified in the input, and (b) limit the task to only the frequent entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MEI models generalize well across domains on multiple datasets with supervised models and LLM-based few-shot prompting. Additionally, MEI fits the classification framework, which enables the use of robust and intuitive classification-based metrics. Finally, MEI is also of practical use as it allows a user to search for all mentions of a particular entity or a group of entities of interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose MMLU-SR, a novel dataset designed to measure the true comprehension abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by challenging their performance in question-answering tasks with modified terms. We reasoned that an agent that "truly" understands a concept can still evaluate it when key terms are replaced by suitably defined alternate terms, and sought to differentiate such comprehension from mere text replacement. In our study, we modified standardized test questions by replacing a key term with a dummy word along with its definition. The key term could be in the context of questions, answers, or both questions and answers. Notwithstanding the high scores achieved by recent popular LLMs on the MMLU leaderboard, we found a substantial reduction in model performance after such replacement, suggesting poor comprehension. This new benchmark provides a rigorous benchmark for testing true model comprehension, and poses a challenge to the broader scientific community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Quinton, Val\'erian Rey</p>
<p>Abstract: Many optimization problems require balancing multiple conflicting objectives. As gradient descent is limited to single-objective optimization, we introduce its direct generalization: Jacobian descent (JD). This algorithm iteratively updates parameters using the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued objective function, in which each row is the gradient of an individual objective. While several methods to combine gradients already exist in the literature, they are generally hindered when the objectives conflict. In contrast, we propose projecting gradients to fully resolve conflict while ensuring that they preserve an influence proportional to their norm. We prove significantly stronger convergence guarantees with this approach, supported by our empirical results. Our method also enables instance-wise risk minimization (IWRM), a novel learning paradigm in which the loss of each training example is considered a separate objective. Applied to simple image classification tasks, IWRM exhibits promising results compared to the direct minimization of the average loss. Additionally, we outline an efficient implementation of JD using the Gramian of the Jacobian matrix to reduce time and memory requirements.</p>

LoCoVQA augments test examples for mathematical reasoning, VQA, and character recognition tasks with increasingly long visual contexts composed of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution distractor images.
  Across these tasks, a diverse set of VLMs rapidly lose performance as the visual context length grows, often exhibiting a striking logarithmic decay trend. This test assesses how well VLMs can ignore irrelevant information when answering queries -- a task that is quite easy for language models (LMs) in the text domain -- demonstrating that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack this essential capability for many long-context applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nisarg Patel, Mohith Kulkarni, Mihir Parmar, Aashna Budhiraja, Mutsumi Nakamura, Neeraj Varshney, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit remarkable performance in natural language understanding tasks, there is a crucial need to measure their ability for human-like multi-step logical reasoning. Existing logical reasoning evaluation benchmarks often focus primarily on simplistic single-step or multi-step reasoning with a limited set of inference rules. Furthermore, the lack of datasets for evaluating non-monotonic reasoning represents a crucial gap since it aligns more closely with human-like reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-LogiEval, a comprehensive evaluation dataset encompassing multi-step logical reasoning with various inference rules and depths. Multi-LogiEval covers three logic types--propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic--consisting of more than 30 inference rules and more than 60 of their combinations with various depths. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct evaluations on a range of LLMs including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini-Pro, Yi, Orca, and Mistral, employing a zero-shot chain-of-thought. Experimental results show that there is a significant drop in the performance of LLMs as the reasoning steps/depth increases (average accuracy of ~68% at depth-1 to ~43% at depth-5). We further conduct a thorough investigation of reasoning chains generated by LLMs which reveals several important findings. We believe that Multi-LogiEval facilitates future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs. Data is available at https://github.com/Mihir3009/Multi-LogiEval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miyoung Ko, Sue Hyun Park, Joonsuk Park, Minjoon Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the advances in large language models (LLMs), how they use their knowledge for reasoning is not yet well understood. In this study, we propose a method that deconstructs complex real-world questions into a graph, representing each question as a node with predecessors of background knowledge needed to solve the question. We develop the DepthQA dataset, deconstructing questions into three depths: (i) recalling conceptual knowledge, (ii) applying procedural knowledge, and (iii) analyzing strategic knowledge. Based on a hierarchical graph, we quantify forward discrepancy, a discrepancy in LLM performance on simpler sub-problems versus complex questions. We also measure backward discrepancy where LLMs answer complex questions but struggle with simpler ones. Our analysis shows that smaller models exhibit more discrepancies than larger models. Distinct patterns of discrepancies are observed across model capacity and possibility of training data memorization. Additionally, guiding models from simpler to complex questions through multi-turn interactions improves performance across model sizes, highlighting the importance of structured intermediate steps in knowledge reasoning. This work enhances our understanding of LLM reasoning and suggests ways to improve their problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into real-world applications. Due to the lack of benchmarks, the community has yet to fully understand the hallucination issues within these models. To address this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive diagnostic benchmark, ToolBH. Specifically, we assess the LLM's hallucinations through two perspectives: depth and breadth. In terms of depth, we propose a multi-level diagnostic process, including (1) solvability detection, (2) solution planning, and (3) missing-tool analysis. For breadth, we consider three scenarios based on the characteristics of the toolset: missing necessary tools, potential tools, and limited functionality tools. Furthermore, we developed seven tasks and collected 700 evaluation samples through multiple rounds of manual annotation. The results show the significant challenges presented by the ToolBH benchmark. The current advanced models Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o only achieve total scores of 45.3 and 37.0, respectively, on a scale of 100. In this benchmark, larger model parameters do not guarantee better performance; the training data and response strategies also play crucial roles in tool-enhanced LLM scenarios. Our diagnostic analysis indicates that the primary reason for model errors lies in assessing task solvability. Additionally, open-weight models suffer from performance drops with verbose replies, whereas proprietary models excel with longer reasoning.</p>

Then we enrich the dataset in a self-supervised fashion by formulating six auxiliary tasks. A VLM finetuned with the resulting collection of datasets can generate meaningful robot action policy decisions. Our experiments across multiple simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed LLaRA framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshara Prabhakar, Thomas L. Griffiths, R. Thomas McCoy</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow heuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs -- GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested with GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from 26% to 70%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning. Code and data at this https://github.com/aksh555/deciphering_cot</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ian Wu, Sravan Jayanthi, Vijay Viswanathan, Simon Rosenberg, Sina Pakazad, Tongshuang Wu, Graham Neubig</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MMRAG) is a powerful approach to question-answering over multimodal documents. A key challenge with evaluating MMRAG is the paucity of high-quality datasets matching the question styles and modalities of interest. In light of this, we propose SMMQG, a synthetic data generation framework. SMMQG leverages interplay between a retriever, large language model (LLM) and large multimodal model (LMM) to generate question and answer pairs directly from multimodal documents, with the questions conforming to specified styles and modalities. We use SMMQG to generate an MMRAG dataset of 1024 questions over Wikipedia documents and evaluate state-of-the-art models using it, revealing insights into model performance that are attainable only through style- and modality-specific evaluation data. Next, we measure the quality of data produced by SMMQG via a human study. We find that the quality of SMMQG-generated synthetic data is on par with the quality of the crowdsourced benchmark MMQA and that downstream evaluation results using both datasets strongly concur.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Zhou, Dan Xu, Yiding Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving technologies involve the capability to effectively process and learn from extensive real-world driving data. Current imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning methods have shown remarkable promise in autonomous systems, harnessing the power of offline datasets to make informed decisions in open-loop (non-reactive agents) settings. However, learning-based agents face significant challenges when transferring knowledge from open-loop to closed-loop (reactive agents) environment. The performance is significantly impacted by data distribution shift, sample efficiency, the complexity of uncovering hidden world models and physics. To address these issues, we propose Sample-efficient Imitative Multi-token Decision Transformer (SimDT). SimDT introduces multi-token prediction, online imitative learning pipeline and prioritized experience replay to sequence-modelling reinforcement learning. The performance is evaluated through empirical experiments and results exceed popular imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms both in open-loop and closed-loop settings on Waymax benchmark. SimDT exhibits 41% reduction in collision rate and 18% improvement in reaching the destination compared with the baseline method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruida Wang, Jipeng Zhang, Yizhen Jia, Rui Pan, Shizhe Diao, Renjie Pi, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Proving mathematical theorems using computer-verifiable formal languages like Lean significantly impacts mathematical reasoning. One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs. However, due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance.This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes TheoremLlama, an end-to-end framework that trains a general-purpose LLM to be a Lean4 expert. TheoremLlama includes NL-FL dataset generation and bootstrapping method to obtain aligned dataset, curriculum learning and block training techniques to train the model, and iterative proof writing method to write Lean4 proofs that work together synergistically. Using the dataset generation method in TheoremLlama, we provide Open Bootstrapped Theorems (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset. Our novel NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leverages the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning. The TheoremLlama framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%. Our code, model checkpoints, and the generated dataset is published in GitHub</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya K Surikuchi, Raquel Fern\'andez, Sandro Pezzelle</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a temporally ordered sequence of images. This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story 'good'. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a 'good' story may require more than a human-like level of visual grounding, coherence, and repetition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianheng Ling, Chao Qian, Gregor Schiele</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the design of a hardware accelerator for Transformers, optimized for on-device time-series forecasting in AIoT systems. It integrates integer-only quantization and Quantization-Aware Training with optimized hardware designs to realize 6-bit and 4-bit quantized Transformer models, which achieved precision comparable to 8-bit quantized models from related research. Utilizing a complete implementation on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15), we examine the feasibility of deploying Transformer models on embedded IoT devices. This includes a thorough analysis of achievable precision, resource utilization, timing, power, and energy consumption for on-device inference. Our results indicate that while sufficient performance can be attained, the optimization process is not trivial. For instance, reducing the quantization bitwidth does not consistently result in decreased latency or energy consumption, underscoring the necessity of systematically exploring various optimization combinations. Compared to an 8-bit quantized Transformer model in related studies, our 4-bit quantized Transformer model increases test loss by only 0.63%, operates up to 132.33x faster, and consumes 48.19x less energy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) is a crucial area of Visual Language Understanding. However, the robustness and consistency of current Visual Language Models (VLMs) in this field remain under-explored. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on comprehensive datasets, developed specifically for this study, encompassing diverse question categories and chart formats. We investigate two key aspects: 1) the models' ability to handle varying levels of chart and question complexity, and 2) their robustness across different visual representations of the same underlying data. Our analysis reveals significant performance variations based on question and chart types, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current models. Additionally, we identify areas for improvement and propose future research directions to build more robust and reliable CQA systems. This study sheds light on the limitations of current models and paves the way for future advancements in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng He, Chun Ouyang, Laith Alzubaidi, Alistair Barros, Catarina Moreira</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks are a potential threat to machine learning models by causing incorrect predictions through imperceptible perturbations to the input data. While these attacks have been extensively studied in unstructured data like images, applying them to tabular data, poses new challenges. These challenges arise from the inherent heterogeneity and complex feature interdependencies in tabular data, which differ from the image data. To account for this distinction, it is necessary to establish tailored imperceptibility criteria specific to tabular data. However, there is currently a lack of standardised metrics for assessing the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on tabular data. To address this gap, we propose a set of key properties and corresponding metrics designed to comprehensively characterise imperceptible adversarial attacks on tabular data. These are: proximity to the original input, sparsity of altered features, deviation from the original data distribution, sensitivity in perturbing features with narrow distribution, immutability of certain features that should remain unchanged, feasibility of specific feature values that should not go beyond valid practical ranges, and feature interdependencies capturing complex relationships between data attributes. We evaluate the imperceptibility of five adversarial attacks, including both bounded attacks and unbounded attacks, on tabular data using the proposed imperceptibility metrics. The results reveal a trade-off between the imperceptibility and effectiveness of these attacks. The study also identifies limitations in current attack algorithms, offering insights that can guide future research in the area. The findings gained from this empirical analysis provide valuable direction for enhancing the design of adversarial attack algorithms, thereby advancing adversarial machine learning on tabular data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannes Mareen, Dimitrios Karageorgiou, Glenn Van Wallendael, Peter Lambert, Symeon Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital image manipulation has become increasingly accessible and realistic with the advent of generative AI technologies. Recent developments allow for text-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal effort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example, diffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into the original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case, traditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper introduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive collection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image forgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF dataset includes approximately 75k forged images, originating from popular open-source and commercial methods, namely SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. We benchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods on TGIF. Whereas traditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect regenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the regenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted area. Finally, both IFL and SID methods fail when exposed to stronger compression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such as WEBP. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of state-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern generative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable IFL and SID methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nemika Tyagi, Mihir Parmar, Mohith Kulkarni, Aswin RRV, Nisarg Patel, Mutsumi Nakamura, Arindam Mitra, Chitta Baral</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving grid puzzles involves a significant amount of logical reasoning. Hence, it is a good domain to evaluate the reasoning capability of a model which can then guide us to improve the reasoning ability of models. However, most existing works evaluate only the final predicted answer of a puzzle, without delving into an in-depth analysis of the LLMs' reasoning chains (such as where they falter) or providing any finer metrics to evaluate them. Since LLMs may rely on simple heuristics or artifacts to predict the final answer, it is crucial to evaluate the generated reasoning chain beyond overall correctness measures, for accurately evaluating the reasoning abilities of LLMs. To this end, we first develop GridPuzzle, an evaluation dataset comprising 274 grid-based puzzles with different complexities. Second, we propose a new error taxonomy derived from manual analysis of reasoning chains from LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini, Mistral, and Llama-2. Then, we develop an LLM-based framework for large-scale subjective evaluation (i.e., identifying errors) and an objective metric, PuzzleEval, to evaluate the correctness of reasoning chains. Evaluating reasoning chains from LLMs leads to several interesting findings. We further show that existing prompting methods used for enhancing models' reasoning abilities do not improve performance on GridPuzzle. This highlights the importance of understanding fine-grained errors and presents a challenge for future research to enhance LLMs' puzzle-solving abilities by developing methods that address these errors.

<p>Abstract: We present Im2Flow2Act, a scalable learning framework that enables robots to acquire real-world manipulation skills without the need of real-world robot training data. The key idea behind Im2Flow2Act is to use object flow as the manipulation interface, bridging domain gaps between different embodiments (i.e., human and robot) and training environments (i.e., real-world and simulated). Im2Flow2Act comprises two components: a flow generation network and a flow-conditioned policy. The flow generation network, trained on human demonstration videos, generates object flow from the initial scene image, conditioned on the task description. The flow-conditioned policy, trained on simulated robot play data, maps the generated object flow to robot actions to realize the desired object movements. By using flow as input, this policy can be directly deployed in the real world with a minimal sim-to-real gap. By leveraging real-world human videos and simulated robot play data, we bypass the challenges of teleoperating physical robots in the real world, resulting in a scalable system for diverse tasks. We demonstrate Im2Flow2Act's capabilities in a variety of real-world tasks, including the manipulation of rigid, articulated, and deformable objects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Software is one of the most powerful tools that we humans have at our disposal; it allows a skilled programmer to interact with the world in complex and profound ways. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. In this paper, we introduce OpenHands (f.k.a. OpenDevin), a platform for the development of powerful and flexible AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a human developer: by writing code, interacting with a command line, and browsing the web. We describe how the platform allows for the implementation of new agents, safe interaction with sandboxed environments for code execution, coordination between multiple agents, and incorporation of evaluation benchmarks. Based on our currently incorporated benchmarks, we perform an evaluation of agents over 15 challenging tasks, including software engineering (e.g., SWE-BENCH) and web browsing (e.g., WEBARENA), among others. Released under the permissive MIT license, OpenHands is a community project spanning academia and industry with more than 2.1K contributions from over 188 contributors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechen Zhang, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
<p>Abstract: The infinite width limit of random neural networks is known to result in Neural Networks as Gaussian Process (NNGP) (Lee et al. [2018]), characterized by task-independent kernels. It is widely accepted that larger network widths contribute to improved generalization (Park et al. [2019]). However, this work challenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the Bayesian Parallel Branching Graph Neural Network (BPB-GNN), an architecture that resembles residual networks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-GNN is significantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branch exhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernel renormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-GNN in the narrow width limit is generally superior or comparable to that achieved in the wide width limit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branch in the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architectural hyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. Our results characterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branching networks in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifeng Ding, Yifeng Li, Yuan He, Antonio Norelli, Jingcheng Wu, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma, Michael Bronstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Wang, Jindong Han, Wei Fan, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p>

Second, there is a lack of a large-scale dysfluency corpus. Third, there is not an effective learning framework. In this paper, we propose \textit{SSDM: Scalable Speech Dysfluency Modeling}, which (1) adopts articulatory gestures as scalable forced alignment; (2) introduces connectionist subsequence aligner (CSA) to achieve dysfluency alignment; (3) introduces a large-scale simulated dysfluency corpus called Libri-Dys; and (4) develops an end-to-end system by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs). We expect SSDM to serve as a standard in the area of dysfluency modeling. Demo is available at \url{https://berkeley-speech-group.github.io/SSDM/}.</p>

CyberCortex AI is a decentralized distributed OS which enables robots to talk to each other, as well as to High Performance Computers (HPC) in the cloud. Sensory and control data from the robots is streamed towards HPC systems with the purpose of training AI algorithms, which are afterwards deployed on the robots. Each functionality of a robot (e.g. sensory data acquisition, path planning, motion control, etc.) is executed within a so-called DataBlock of Filters shared through the internet, where each filter is computed either locally on the robot itself, or remotely on a different robotic system. The data is stored and accessed via a so-called Temporal Addressable Memory (TAM), which acts as a gateway between each filter's input and output. CyberCortex AI has two main components: i) the CyberCortex AI inference system, which is a real-time implementation of the DataBlock running on the robots' embedded hardware, and ii) the CyberCortex AI dojo, which runs on an HPC computer in the cloud, and it is used to design, train and deploy AI algorithms. We present a quantitative and qualitative performance analysis of the proposed approach using two collaborative robotics applications: i) a forest fires prevention system based on an Unitree A1 legged robot and an Anafi Parrot 4K drone, as well as ii) an autonomous driving system which uses CyberCortex AI for collaborative perception and motion control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chhavi Yadav, Ruihan Wu, Kamalika Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: Influence Functions are a standard tool for attributing predictions to training data in a principled manner and are widely used in applications such as data valuation and fairness. In this work, we present realistic incentives to manipulate influence-based attributions and investigate whether these attributions can be \textit{systematically} tampered by an adversary. We show that this is indeed possible for logistic regression models trained on ResNet feature embeddings and standard tabular fairness datasets and provide efficient attacks with backward-friendly implementations. Our work raises questions on the reliability of influence-based attributions in adversarial circumstances.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Thompson, Nitika Mathur, Daniel Deutsch, Huda Khayrallah</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting an automatic metric that best emulates human annotators is often non-trivial, because there is no clear definition of "best emulates." A meta-metric is required to compare the human judgments to the automatic metric scores, and metric rankings depend on the choice of meta-metric. We propose Soft Pairwise Accuracy (SPA), a new meta-metric that builds on Pairwise Accuracy (PA) but incorporates the statistical significance of both the human judgments and the metric scores. We show that SPA is more stable than PA with respect to changes in the number of systems/segments used for evaluation. We also show that PA can only assign a small set of distinct output values to metrics, and this results in many metrics being artificially assigned the exact same PA score. We demonstrate that SPA fixes this issue. Finally, we show that SPA is more discriminative than PA, producing more statistically significant comparisons between metrics. SPA was selected as the official system-level metric for the 2024 WMT Metrics Shared Task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pranav Jeevan, Neeraj Nixon, Amit Sethi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in single image super-resolution have been predominantly driven by token mixers and transformer architectures. WaveMixSR utilized the WaveMix architecture, employing a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform for spatial token mixing, achieving superior performance in super-resolution tasks with remarkable resource efficiency. In this work, we present an enhanced version of the WaveMixSR architecture by (1) replacing the traditional transpose convolution layer with a pixel shuffle operation and (2) implementing a multistage design for higher resolution tasks ($4\times$). Our experiments demonstrate that our enhanced model -- WaveMixSR-V2 -- outperforms other architectures in multiple super-resolution tasks, achieving state-of-the-art for the BSD100 dataset, while also consuming fewer resources, exhibits higher parameter efficiency, lower latency and higher throughput.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Filandrianos, Eva Tsouparopoulou, Dimitris Parsanoglou, Maria Symeonaki, Giorgos Stamou</p>
<p>Abstract: Gender bias in machine translation (MT) systems poses significant challenges that often result in the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. Especially in the labour domain where frequently occupations are inaccurately associated with specific genders, such biases perpetuate traditional gender stereotypes with a significant impact on society. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring equitable and accurate MT systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to studying occupation-related gender bias through the creation of the GOSt-MT (Gender and Occupation Statistics for Machine Translation) Knowledge Graph. GOSt-MT integrates comprehensive gender statistics from real-world labour data and textual corpora used in MT training. This Knowledge Graph allows for a detailed analysis of gender bias across English, French, and Greek, facilitating the identification of persistent stereotypes and areas requiring intervention. By providing a structured framework for understanding how occupations are gendered in both labour markets and MT systems, GOSt-MT contributes to efforts aimed at making MT systems more equitable and reducing gender biases in automated translations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Bibb\'o, Thomas Deacon, Arshdeep Singh, Mark D. Plumbley</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a residential audio dataset to support sound event detection research for smart home applications aimed at promoting wellbeing for older adults. The dataset is constructed by deploying audio recording systems in the homes of 8 participants aged 55-80 years for a 7-day period. Acoustic characteristics are documented through detailed floor plans and construction material information to enable replication of the recording environments for AI model deployment. A novel automated speech removal pipeline is developed, using pre-trained audio neural networks to detect and remove segments containing spoken voice, while preserving segments containing other sound events. The resulting dataset consists of privacy-compliant audio recordings that accurately capture the soundscapes and activities of daily living within residential spaces. The paper details the dataset creation methodology, the speech removal pipeline utilizing cascaded model architectures, and an analysis of the vocal label distribution to validate the speech removal process. This dataset enables the development and benchmarking of sound event detection models tailored specifically for in-home applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Liao, Lingbo Mo, Chejian Xu, Mintong Kang, Jiawei Zhang, Chaowei Xiao, Yuan Tian, Bo Li, Huan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalist web agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomously completing a wide range of tasks on real websites, significantly boosting human productivity. However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve users' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents accidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for attacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments. We collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user request. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a defensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate. Notably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via human inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between security and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA seamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further discuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites without relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Liu, Liuyi Jin, Radu Stoleru, Amran Haroon, Charles Swanson, Kexin Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art residential irrigation systems, such as WaterMyYard, rely on rainfall data from nearby weather stations to adjust irrigation amounts. However, the accuracy of rainfall data is compromised by the limited spatial resolution of rain gauges and the significant variability of hyperlocal rainfall, leading to substantial water waste. To improve irrigation efficiency, we developed a cost-effective irrigation system, dubbed ERIC, which employs machine learning models to estimate rainfall from commodity doorbell camera footage and optimizes irrigation schedules without human intervention. Specifically, we: a) designed novel visual and audio features with lightweight neural network models to infer rainfall from the camera at the edge, preserving user privacy; b) built a complete end-to-end irrigation system on Raspberry Pi 4, costing only \$75. We deployed the system across five locations (collecting over 750 hours of video) with varying backgrounds and light conditions. Comprehensive evaluation validates that ERIC achieves state-of-the-art rainfall estimation performance ($\sim$ 5mm/day), saving 9,112 gallons/month of water, translating to \$28.56/month in utility savings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iwo Naglik, Mateusz Lango</p>
<p>Abstract: Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a recently proposed task of aspect-based sentiment analysis that consists in extracting (aspect phrase, opinion phrase, sentiment polarity) triples from a given sentence. Recent state-of-the-art methods approach this task by first extracting all possible text spans from a given text, then filtering the potential aspect and opinion phrases with a classifier, and finally considering all their pairs with another classifier that additionally assigns sentiment polarity to them. Although several variations of the above scheme have been proposed, the common feature is that the final result is constructed by a sequence of independent classifier decisions. This hinders the exploitation of dependencies between extracted phrases and prevents the use of knowledge about the interrelationships between classifier predictions to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a new ASTE approach consisting of three transformer-inspired layers, which enables the modelling of dependencies both between phrases and between the final classifier decisions. Experimental results show that the method achieves higher performance in terms of F1 measure than other methods studied on popular benchmarks. In addition, we show that a simple pre-training technique further improves the performance of the model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have aimed to integrate and interpret data across diverse modalities. However, the capacity of these models to concurrently process and reason about multiple modalities remains inadequately explored, partly due to the lack of comprehensive modality-wise benchmarks. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench is distinguished by high-quality human annotations, ensuring that accurate responses require integrated understanding and reasoning across all three modalities. Our main findings reveal that: i) most OLMs exhibit critical limitations in instruction-following and reasoning capabilities within tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baselines models perform poorly (below 50\% accuracy) even when provided with alternative textual representations of images or/and audio. These results suggest that the ability to construct a consistent context from text, image, and audio is often overlooked in existing MLLM training paradigms. To address this gap, we curate an instruction tuning dataset of 84.5K training samples, OmniInstruct, for training OLMs to adapt to multimodal contexts. We advocate for future research to focus on developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance across diverse modalities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheda Mai, Ping Zhang, Cheng-Hao Tu, Hong-You Chen, Li Zhang, Wei-Lun Chao</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has attracted significant attention lately, due to the increasing size of pre-trained models and the need to fine-tune (FT) them for superior downstream performance. This community-wide enthusiasm has sparked a plethora of approaches. Nevertheless, a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking, leaving questions like when to apply PETL and which approach to use largely unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PETL methods in the context of Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyper-parameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study not only offers a valuable user guide but also unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PETL methods can obtain similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple methods like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second, though with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in many-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than full FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we investigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone). Perhaps not surprisingly, PETL methods outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, the fully fine-tuned model can better balance target (i.e., downstream) distribution and distribution shift performance, suggesting a future research direction for PETL.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applications underscores the pressing need for robust security measures to thwart potential jailbreak attacks. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities within LLMs, endanger data integrity and user privacy. Guardrails serve as crucial protective mechanisms against such threats, but existing models often fall short in terms of both detection accuracy, and computational efficiency. This paper advocates for the significance of jailbreak attack prevention on LLMs, and emphasises the role of input guardrails in safeguarding these models. We introduce MoJE (Mixture of Jailbreak Expert), a novel guardrail architecture designed to surpass current limitations in existing state-of-the-art guardrails. By employing simple linguistic statistical techniques, MoJE excels in detecting jailbreak attacks while maintaining minimal computational overhead during model inference. Through rigorous experimentation, MoJE demonstrates superior performance capable of detecting 90% of the attacks without compromising benign prompts, enhancing LLMs security against jailbreak attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongseo Lee, Geo Ahn, Seong Tae Kim, Jinwoo Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: For automatic human figure drawing (HFD) assessment tasks, such as diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using HFD images, the clarity and explainability of a model decision are crucial. Existing pixel-level attribution-based explainable AI (XAI) approaches demand considerable effort from users to interpret the semantic information of a region in an image, which can be often time-consuming and impractical. To overcome this challenge, we propose a part contribution evaluation based model explanation (PCEvE) framework. On top of the part detection, we measure the Shapley Value of each individual part to evaluate the contribution to a model decision. Unlike existing attribution-based XAI approaches, the PCEvE provides a straightforward explanation of a model decision, i.e., a part contribution histogram. Furthermore, the PCEvE expands the scope of explanations beyond the conventional sample-level to include class-level and task-level insights, offering a richer, more comprehensive understanding of model behavior. We rigorously validate the PCEvE via extensive experiments on multiple HFD assessment datasets. Also, we sanity-check the proposed method with a set of controlled experiments. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility and applicability of our method to other domains by applying it to a photo-realistic dataset, the Stanford Cars.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghwan Kim, Tae-Kyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D human shape reconstruction under severe occlusion due to human-object or human-human interaction is a challenging problem. Parametric models i.e., SMPL(-X), which are based on the statistics across human shapes, can represent whole human body shapes but are limited to minimally-clothed human shapes. Implicit-function-based methods extract features from the parametric models to employ prior knowledge of human bodies and can capture geometric details such as clothing and hair. However, they often struggle to handle misaligned parametric models and inpaint occluded regions given a single RGB image. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MHCDIFF, Multi-hypotheses Conditioned Point Cloud Diffusion, composed of point cloud diffusion conditioned on probabilistic distributions for pixel-aligned detailed 3D human reconstruction under occlusion. Compared to previous implicit-function-based methods, the point cloud diffusion model can capture the global consistent features to generate the occluded regions, and the denoising process corrects the misaligned SMPL meshes. The core of MHCDIFF is extracting local features from multiple hypothesized SMPL(-X) meshes and aggregating the set of features to condition the diffusion model. In the experiments on CAPE and MultiHuman datasets, the proposed method outperforms various SOTA methods based on SMPL, implicit functions, point cloud diffusion, and their combined, under synthetic and real occlusions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehan Li, Yan Hu, Scott Lane, Salih Selek, Lokesh Shahani, Rodrigo Machado-Vieira, Jair Soares, Hua Xu, Hongfang Liu, Ming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate identification and categorization of suicidal events can yield better suicide precautions, reducing operational burden, and improving care quality in high-acuity psychiatric settings. Pre-trained language models offer promise for identifying suicidality from unstructured clinical narratives. We evaluated the performance of four BERT-based models using two fine-tuning strategies (multiple single-label and single multi-label) for detecting coexisting suicidal events from 500 annotated psychiatric evaluation notes. The notes were labeled for suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). RoBERTa outperformed other models using multiple single-label classification strategy (acc=0.86, F1=0.78). MentalBERT (acc=0.83, F1=0.74) also exceeded BioClinicalBERT (acc=0.82, F1=0.72) which outperformed BERT (acc=0.80, F1=0.70). RoBERTa fine-tuned with single multi-label classification further improved the model performance (acc=0.88, F1=0.81). The findings highlight that the model optimization, pretraining with domain-relevant data, and the single multi-label classification strategy enhance the model performance of suicide phenotyping.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Galbally, Aleksandrs Cepilovs, Ramon Blanco-Gonzalo, Gillian Ormiston, Oscar Miguel-Hurtado, Istvan Sz. Racz</p>
<p>Abstract: Even though a few initial works have shown on small sets of data some level of bias in the performance of fingerprint recognition technology with respect to certain demographic groups, there is still not sufficient evidence to understand the impact that certain factors such as gender, age or finger-type may have on fingerprint quality and, in turn, also on fingerprint matching accuracy. The present work addresses this still under researched topic, on a large-scale database of operational data containing 10-print impressions of almost 16,000 subjects. The results reached provide further insight into the dependency of fingerprint quality and demographics, and show that there in fact exists a certain degree of performance variability in fingerprint-based recognition systems for different segments of the population. Based on the experimental evaluation, the work points out new observations based on data-driven evidence, provides plausible hypotheses to explain such observations, and concludes with potential follow-up actions that can help to reduce the observed fingerprint quality differences. This way, the current paper can be considered as a contribution to further increase the algorithmic fairness and equality of biometric technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaushik Roy, Akila Dissanayake, Brendan Tidd, Peyman Moghadam</p>
<p>Abstract: Lifelong imitation learning for manipulation tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts that occur in incremental learning steps. Existing methods often focus on unsupervised skill discovery to construct an ever-growing skill library or distillation from multiple policies, which can lead to scalability issues as diverse manipulation tasks are continually introduced and may fail to ensure a consistent latent space throughout the learning process, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned skills. In this paper, we introduce M2Distill, a multi-modal distillation-based method for lifelong imitation learning focusing on preserving consistent latent space across vision, language, and action distributions throughout the learning process. By regulating the shifts in latent representations across different modalities from previous to current steps, and reducing discrepancies in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) policies between consecutive learning steps, we ensure that the learned policy retains its ability to perform previously learned tasks while seamlessly integrating new skills. Extensive evaluations on the LIBERO lifelong imitation learning benchmark suites, including LIBERO-OBJECT, LIBERO-GOAL, and LIBERO-SPATIAL, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Yoshua Bengio, Hossein Hajimirsadegh</p>
<p>Abstract: The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R. Thomas McCoy, Shunyu Yao, Dan Friedman, Mathew D. Hardy, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: In "Embers of Autoregression" (McCoy et al., 2023), we showed that several large language models (LLMs) have some important limitations that are attributable to their origins in next-word prediction. Here we investigate whether these issues persist with o1, a new system from OpenAI that differs from previous LLMs in that it is optimized for reasoning. We find that o1 substantially outperforms previous LLMs in many cases, with particularly large improvements on rare variants of common tasks (e.g., forming acronyms from the second letter of each word in a list, rather than the first letter). Despite these quantitative improvements, however, o1 still displays the same qualitative trends that we observed in previous systems. Specifically, o1 -- like previous LLMs -- is sensitive to the probability of examples and tasks, performing better and requiring fewer "thinking tokens" in high-probability settings than in low-probability ones. These results show that optimizing a language model for reasoning can mitigate but might not fully overcome the language model's probability sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omkar Kulkarni, Rohitash Chandra</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical time series datasets feature missing values that need data imputation methods, however, conventional machine learning models fall short due to a lack of uncertainty quantification in predictions. Among these models, the CATSI (Context-Aware Time Series Imputation) stands out for its effectiveness by incorporating a context vector into the imputation process, capturing the global dependencies of each patient. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Context-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages uncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the time series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference assumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest to the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational Bayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that Bayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model. Specifically, an instance of Bayes-CATSI outperforms CATSI by 9.57 %. We provide an open-source code implementation for applying Bayes-CATSI to other medical data imputation problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anwoy Chatterjee, H S V N S Kowndinya Renduchintala, Sumit Bhatia, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are found to be surprisingly sensitive to minor variations in prompts, often generating significantly divergent outputs in response to minor variations in the prompts, such as spelling errors, alteration of wording or the prompt template. However, while assessing the quality of an LLM, the focus often tends to be solely on its performance on downstream tasks, while very little to no attention is paid to prompt sensitivity. To fill this gap, we propose POSIX - a novel PrOmpt Sensitivity IndeX as a reliable measure of prompt sensitivity, thereby offering a more comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance. The key idea behind POSIX is to capture the relative change in loglikelihood of a given response upon replacing the corresponding prompt with a different intent-preserving prompt. We provide thorough empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of POSIX in capturing prompt sensitivity and subsequently use it to measure and thereby compare prompt sensitivity of various open-source LLMs. We find that merely increasing the parameter count or instruction tuning does not necessarily reduce prompt sensitivity whereas adding some few-shot exemplars, even just one, almost always leads to significant decrease in prompt sensitivity. We also find that alterations to prompt template lead to the highest sensitivity in the case of MCQ type tasks, whereas paraphrasing results in the highest sensitivity in open-ended generation tasks.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02220">Buckle Up: Robustifying LLMs at Every Customization Stage via Data Curation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoqun Liu, Jiacheng Liang, Luoxi Tang, Chenyu You, Muchao Ye, Zhaohan Xi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are extensively adapted for downstream applications through a process known as "customization," with fine-tuning being a common method for integrating domain-specific expertise. However, recent studies have revealed a vulnerability that tuning LLMs with malicious samples can compromise their robustness and amplify harmful content, an attack known as "jailbreaking." To mitigate such attack, we propose an effective defensive framework utilizing data curation to revise commonsense texts and enhance their safety implication from the perspective of LLMs. The curated texts can mitigate jailbreaking attacks at every stage of the customization process: before customization to immunize LLMs against future jailbreak attempts, during customization to neutralize jailbreaking risks, or after customization to restore the compromised models. Since the curated data strengthens LLMs through the standard fine-tuning workflow, we do not introduce additional modules during LLM inference, thereby preserving the original customization process. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial reduction in jailbreaking effects, with up to a 100% success in generating responsible responses. Notably, our method is effective even with commonsense texts, which are often more readily available than safety-relevant data. With the every-stage defensive framework and supporting experimental performance, this work represents a significant advancement in mitigating jailbreaking risks and ensuring the secure customization of LLMs.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02240">SCA: Highly Efficient Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attack</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Pan, Weibin Wu, Yuhang Cao, Zibin Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks typically manipulate the semantic content of an image (e.g., color or texture) to create adversarial examples that are both effective and photorealistic. Recent works have utilized the diffusion inversion process to map images into a latent space, where high-level semantics are manipulated by introducing perturbations. However, they often results in substantial semantic distortions in the denoised output and suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Semantic-Consistent Unrestricted Adversarial Attacks (SCA), which employs an inversion method to extract edit-friendly noise maps and utilizes Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to provide semantic guidance throughout the process. Under the condition of rich semantic information provided by MLLM, we perform the DDPM denoising process of each step using a series of edit-friendly noise maps, and leverage DPM Solver++ to accelerate this process, enabling efficient sampling with semantic consistency. Compared to existing methods, our framework enables the efficient generation of adversarial examples that exhibit minimal discernible semantic changes. Consequently, we for the first time introduce Semantic-Consistent Adversarial Examples (SCAE). Extensive experiments and visualizations have demonstrated the high efficiency of SCA, particularly in being on average 12 times faster than the state-of-the-art attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Liu, Jiaen Lin, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant popularity in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its effectiveness in introducing new knowledge and reducing hallucinations. However, the deep understanding of RAG remains limited, how does RAG help the reasoning process and can RAG help improve the reasoning capability remains question. While external documents are typically considered as a method to incorporate domain-specific information, they also contain intermediate reasoning results related to the query, this suggests that documents could enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs, which has not been previously explored. In this paper, we investigate this issue in depth and find that while RAG can assist with reasoning, the help is limited. If we conceptualize the reasoning process as a tree with fixed depth, then RAG struggles to assist LLMs in performing deeper reasoning. Additionally, the information in the documents requires preprocessing to filter out noise. We demonstrate that this preprocessing is difficult to achieve simply fine-tuning of the LLM, it often necessitates numerous additional transformer layers to solve the problem. To simplify the problem, we propose DPrompt tuning, which effectively resolves the issue within just limited transformer layers, leading to improved performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Ye, Yanbo Wang, Yue Huang, Dongping Chen, Qihui Zhang, Nuno Moniz, Tian Gao, Werner Geyer, Chao Huang, Pin-Yu Chen, Nitesh V Chawla, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely utilized as an evaluation method in various benchmarks and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, despite their excellence in many domains, potential issues are under-explored, undermining their reliability and the scope of their utility. Therefore, we identify 12 key potential biases and propose a new automated bias quantification framework-CALM-which systematically quantifies and analyzes each type of bias in LLM-as-a-Judge by using automated and principle-guided modification. Our experiments cover multiple popular language models, and the results indicate that while advanced models have achieved commendable overall performance, significant biases persist in certain specific tasks. Empirical results suggest that there remains room for improvement in the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge. Moreover, we also discuss the explicit and implicit influence of these biases and give some suggestions for the reliable application of LLM-as-a-Judge. Our work highlights the need for stakeholders to address these issues and remind users to exercise caution in LLM-as-a-Judge applications.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02745">AVG-LLaVA: A Large Multimodal Model with Adaptive Visual Granularity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibin Lan, Liqiang Niu, Fandong Meng, Wenbo Li, Jie Zhou, Jinsong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, when dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs usually divide them into multiple local images and one global image, which will lead to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. This approach not only reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference, but also improves the overall model performance. Specifically, we introduce the following modules based on LLaVA-NeXT: (a) a visual granularity scaler that includes multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens with different granularities; (b) a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we propose RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).</p>
