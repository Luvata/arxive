<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11900">FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Arakelyan, Pasquale Minervini, Pat Verga, Patrick Lewis, Isabelle Augenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce \textbf{F}aithful \textbf{L}ogic-\textbf{A}ided \textbf{R}easoning and \textbf{E}xploration (\textbf{\ours}), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that {\textbf{\ours}} allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuele Marro, Emanuele La Malfa, Jesse Wright, Guohao Li, Nigel Shadbolt, Michael Wooldridge, Philip Torr</p>
<p>Abstract: Communication is a prerequisite for collaboration. When scaling networks of AI-powered agents, communication must be versatile, efficient, and portable. These requisites, which we refer to as the Agent Communication Trilemma, are hard to achieve in large networks of agents. We introduce Agora, a meta protocol that leverages existing communication standards to make LLM-powered agents solve complex problems efficiently. In Agora, agents typically use standardised routines for frequent communications, natural language for rare communications, and LLM-written routines for everything in between. Agora sidesteps the Agent Communication Trilemma and robustly handles changes in interfaces and members, allowing unprecedented scalability with full decentralisation and minimal involvement of human beings. On large Agora networks, we observe the emergence of self-organising, fully automated protocols that achieve complex goals without human intervention.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marko Djukanovi\'c, Jaume Reixach, Ana Nikolikj, Tome Eftimov, Aleksandar Kartelj, Christian Blum</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the Restricted Longest Common Subsequence (RLCS) problem, an extension of the well-known Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. This problem has significant applications in bioinformatics, particularly for identifying similarities and discovering mutual patterns and important motifs among DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. Building on recent advancements in solving this problem through a general search framework, this paper introduces two novel heuristic approaches designed to enhance the search process by steering it towards promising regions in the search space. The first heuristic employs a probabilistic model to evaluate partial solutions during the search process. The second heuristic is based on a neural network model trained offline using a genetic algorithm. A key aspect of this approach is extracting problem-specific features of partial solutions and the complete problem instance. An effective hybrid method, referred to as the learning beam search, is developed by combining the trained neural network model with a beam search framework. An important contribution of this paper is found in the generation of real-world instances where scientific abstracts serve as input strings, and a set of frequently occurring academic words from the literature are used as restricted patterns. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in solving the RLCS problem. Finally, an empirical explainability analysis is applied to the obtained results. In this way, key feature combinations and their respective contributions to the success or failure of the algorithms across different problem types are identified.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12112">Planning Anything with Rigor: General-Purpose Zero-Shot Planning with LLM-based Formalized Programming</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Hao, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in solving planning problems, there is a trade-off between flexibility and complexity. LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still not capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems such as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many frameworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on task-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples and pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization capability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the core of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the optimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions and effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming capabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach to planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a general-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from planning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization problems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to 9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to multi-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average 83.7% and 86.8% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI o1-preview) with 37.6% and 40.7% improvements. We also validate components of LLMFP with ablation experiments and analyzed the underlying success and failure reasons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongqi Fu, Liri Fang, Zihao Li, Hanghang Tong, Vetle I. Torvik, Jingrui He</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs have been widely used in the past decades of big data and AI to model comprehensive relational data. When analyzing a graph's statistical properties, graph laws serve as essential tools for parameterizing its structure. Identifying meaningful graph laws can significantly enhance the effectiveness of various applications, such as graph generation and link prediction. Facing the large-scale foundation model developments nowadays, the study of graph laws reveals new research potential, e.g., providing multi-modal information for graph neural representation learning and breaking the domain inconsistency of different graph data. In this survey, we first review the previous study of graph laws from multiple perspectives, i.e., macroscope and microscope of graphs, low-order and high-order graphs, static and dynamic graphs, different observation spaces, and newly proposed graph parameters. After we review various real-world applications benefiting from the guidance of graph laws, we conclude the paper with current challenges and future research directions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12207">Divide-Verify-Refine: Aligning LLM Responses with Complex Instructions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianren Zhang, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Zongyu Wu, Qi He, Dongwon Lee, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs, particularly open-source models, struggle to follow complex instructions with multiple constraints. Despite the importance, methods to improve LLMs' adherence to such constraints remain unexplored, and current research focuses on evaluating this ability rather than developing solutions. While a few studies enhance constraint adherence through model tuning, this approach is computationally expensive and heavily reliant on training data quality. An alternative is to leverage LLMs' self-correction capabilities, allowing them to adjust responses to better meet specified constraints. However, this self-correction ability of LLMs is limited by the feedback quality, as LLMs cannot autonomously generate reliable feedback or detect errors. Moreover, the self-refinement process heavily depends on few-shot examples that illustrate how to modify responses to meet constraints. As constraints in complex instructions are diverse and vary widely, manually crafting few-shot examples for each constraint type can be labor-intensive and sub-optimal. To deal with these two challenges, we propose the Divide-Verify-Refine (DVR) framework with three steps: (1) Divide complex instructions into single constraints and prepare appropriate tools; (2) Verify: To address the feedback quality problem, these tools will rigorously verify responses and provide reliable feedback; (3) Refine: To address the constraint diversity challenge, we design a refinement repository that collects successful refinement processes and uses them as few-shot demonstrations for future cases, allowing LLMs to learn from the past experience during inference. Additionally, we develop a new dataset of complex instructions, each containing 1-6 constraints. Experiments show that the framework significantly improves performance, doubling LLama3.1-8B's constraint adherence on instructions with 6 constraints.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12219">OmnixR: Evaluating Omni-modality Language Models on Reasoning across Modalities</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lichang Chen, Hexiang Hu, Mingda Zhang, Yiwen Chen, Zifeng Wang, Yandong Li, Pranav Shyam, Tianyi Zhou, Heng Huang, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Boqing Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce OmnixR, an evaluation suite designed to benchmark SoTA Omni-modality Language Models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini. Evaluating OLMs, which integrate multiple modalities such as text, vision, and audio, presents unique challenges. Particularly, the user message might often consist of multiple modalities, such that OLMs have to establish holistic understanding and reasoning across modalities to accomplish the task. Existing benchmarks are limited to single modality or dual-modality tasks, overlooking comprehensive multi-modal assessments of model reasoning. To address this, OmnixR offers two evaluation variants: (1)synthetic subset: a synthetic dataset generated automatically by translating text into multiple modalities--audio, images, video, and hybrids (Omnify). (2)realistic subset: a real-world dataset, manually curated and annotated by experts, for evaluating cross-modal reasoning in natural settings. OmnixR presents a unique evaluation towards assessing OLMs over a diverse mix of modalities, such as a question that involves video, audio, and text, providing a rigorous cross-modal reasoning testbed unlike any existing benchmarks. Our experiments find that all state-of-the-art OLMs struggle with OmnixR questions that require integrating information from multiple modalities to answer. Further analysis highlights differences in reasoning behavior, underscoring the challenges of omni-modal AI alignment.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12288">A Prompt-Based Knowledge Graph Foundation Model for Universal In-Context Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanning Cui, Zequn Sun, Wei Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Extensive knowledge graphs (KGs) have been constructed to facilitate knowledge-driven tasks across various scenarios. However, existing work usually develops separate reasoning models for different KGs, lacking the ability to generalize and transfer knowledge across diverse KGs and reasoning settings. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based KG foundation model via in-context learning, namely KG-ICL, to achieve a universal reasoning ability. Specifically, we introduce a prompt graph centered with a query-related example fact as context to understand the query relation. To encode prompt graphs with the generalization ability to unseen entities and relations in queries, we first propose a unified tokenizer that maps entities and relations in prompt graphs to predefined tokens. Then, we propose two message passing neural networks to perform prompt encoding and KG reasoning, respectively. We conduct evaluation on 43 different KGs in both transductive and inductive settings. Results indicate that the proposed KG-ICL outperforms baselines on most datasets, showcasing its outstanding generalization and universal reasoning capabilities.

<p>Abstract: Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable abilities in solving complex tasks. However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12375">PRefLexOR: Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning and Agentic Thinking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Markus J. Buehler</p>
<p>Abstract: PRefLexOR (Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) combines preference optimization with concepts from Reinforcement Learning to enable models to self-teach through iterative reasoning improvements. We propose a recursive learning approach that engages the model in multi-step reasoning, revisiting, and refining intermediate steps before producing a final output in training and inference phases. Through multiple training stages, the model first learns to align its reasoning with accurate decision paths by optimizing the log odds between preferred and non-preferred responses. During this process, PRefLexOR builds a dynamic knowledge graph by generating questions from random text chunks and retrieval-augmentation to contextualize relevant details from the entire training corpus. In the second stage, preference optimization enhances model performance by using rejection sampling to fine-tune reasoning quality by continually producing in-situ training data while masking the reasoning steps. Recursive optimization within a thinking token framework introduces iterative feedback loops, where the model refines reasoning, achieving deeper coherence, consistency, and adaptability. Implemented in small language models with only 3 billion parameters, we should that even tiny models can iteratively teach themselves to reason with greater depth and reflectivity. Our implementation is straightforward and can be incorporated into any existing pretrained LLM. We focus our examples on applications in biological materials science and demonstrate the method in a variety of case studies that range from in-domain to cross-domain applications. Using reasoning strategies that include thinking and reflection modalities we build a multi-agent recursive self-improving inference approach to successively improve responses via repeated sampling in inference time.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12376">ShapefileGPT: A Multi-Agent Large Language Model Framework for Automated Shapefile Processing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingming Lin, Rui Hu, Huaxia Li, Sensen Wu, Yadong Li, Kai Fang, Hailin Feng, Zhenhong Du, Liuchang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Vector data is one of the two core data structures in geographic information science (GIS), essential for accurately storing and representing geospatial information. Shapefile, the most widely used vector data format, has become the industry standard supported by all major geographic information systems. However, processing this data typically requires specialized GIS knowledge and skills, creating a barrier for researchers from other fields and impeding interdisciplinary research in spatial data analysis. Moreover, while large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and task automation, they still face challenges in handling the complex spatial and topological relationships inherent in GIS vector data. To address these challenges, we propose ShapefileGPT, an innovative framework powered by LLMs, specifically designed to automate Shapefile tasks. ShapefileGPT utilizes a multi-agent architecture, in which the planner agent is responsible for task decomposition and supervision, while the worker agent executes the tasks. We developed a specialized function library for handling Shapefiles and provided comprehensive API documentation, enabling the worker agent to operate Shapefiles efficiently through function calling. For evaluation, we developed a benchmark dataset based on authoritative textbooks, encompassing tasks in categories such as geometric operations and spatial queries. ShapefileGPT achieved a task success rate of 95.24%, outperforming the GPT series models. In comparison to traditional LLMs, ShapefileGPT effectively handles complex vector data analysis tasks, overcoming the limitations of traditional LLMs in spatial analysis. This breakthrough opens new pathways for advancing automation and intelligence in the GIS field, with significant potential in interdisciplinary data analysis and application contexts.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12389">A Fast Convoluted Story: Scaling Probabilistic Inference for Integer Arithmetic</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lennert De Smet, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires</p>
<p>Abstract: As illustrated by the success of integer linear programming, linear integer arithmetic is a powerful tool for modelling combinatorial problems. Furthermore, the probabilistic extension of linear programming has been used to formulate problems in neurosymbolic AI. However, two key problems persist that prevent the adoption of neurosymbolic techniques beyond toy problems. First, probabilistic inference is inherently hard, #P-hard to be precise. Second, the discrete nature of integers renders the construction of meaningful gradients challenging, which is problematic for learning. In order to mitigate these issues, we formulate linear arithmetic over integer-valued random variables as tensor manipulations that can be implemented in a straightforward fashion using modern deep learning libraries. At the core of our formulation lies the observation that the addition of two integer-valued random variables can be performed by adapting the fast Fourier transform to probabilities in the log-domain. By relying on tensor operations we obtain a differentiable data structure, which unlocks, virtually for free, gradient-based learning. In our experimental validation we show that tensorising probabilistic linear integer arithmetic and leveraging the fast Fourier transform allows us to push the state of the art by several orders of magnitude in terms of inference and learning times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xie, Kexun Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Siyu Yuan, Kai Zhang, Yikai Zhang, Lei Li, Yanghua Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous planning has been an ongoing pursuit since the inception of artificial intelligence. Based on curated problem solvers, early planning agents could deliver precise solutions for specific tasks but lacked generalization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their powerful reasoning capabilities has reignited interest in autonomous planning by automatically generating reasonable solutions for given tasks. However, prior research and our experiments show that current language agents still lack human-level planning abilities. Even the state-of-the-art reasoning model, OpenAI o1, achieves only 15.6% on one of the complex real-world planning benchmarks. This highlights a critical question: What hinders language agents from achieving human-level planning? Although existing studies have highlighted weak performance in agent planning, the deeper underlying issues and the mechanisms and limitations of the strategies proposed to address them remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we apply the feature attribution study and identify two key factors that hinder agent planning: the limited role of constraints and the diminishing influence of questions. We also find that although current strategies help mitigate these challenges, they do not fully resolve them, indicating that agents still have a long way to go before reaching human-level intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stelios Triantafyllou, Aleksa Sukovic, Yasaman Zolfimoselo, Goran Radanovic</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their "intrinsic" contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our decomposition approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicolas Lazzari, Stefano De Giorgis, Aldo Gangemi, Valentina Presutti</p>
<p>Abstract: This work explores the integration of ontology-based reasoning and Machine Learning techniques for explainable value classification. By relying on an ontological formalization of moral values as in the Moral Foundations Theory, relying on the DnS Ontology Design Pattern, the \textit{sandra} neuro-symbolic reasoner is used to infer values (fomalized as descriptions) that are \emph{satisfied by} a certain sentence. Sentences, alongside their structured representation, are automatically generated using an open-source Large Language Model. The inferred descriptions are used to automatically detect the value associated with a sentence. We show that only relying on the reasoner's inference results in explainable classification comparable to other more complex approaches. We show that combining the reasoner's inferences with distributional semantics methods largely outperforms all the baselines, including complex models based on neural network architectures. Finally, we build a visualization tool to explore the potential of theory-based values classification, which is publicly available at http://xmv.geomeaning.com/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijun Tan, Siyuan Zhuang, Kyle Montgomery, William Y. Tang, Alejandro Cuadron, Chenguang Wang, Raluca Ada Popa, Ion Stoica</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available at https://github.com/ScalerLab/JudgeBench .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu-Shin Huang, Peter Just, Krishna Narayanan, Chao Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider coverless steganography where a Large Language Model (LLM) drives an arithmetic coding decoder to generate stego-texts. An efficient method should embed secret message bits in as few language tokens as possible, while still keeping the stego-text natural and fluent. We show that on the individual token level, this problem is mathematically equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a replacement probability distribution of the next token generation, subject to a constraint on the KL divergence between the chosen probability distribution and the original distribution given by the LLM. A closed-form solution is provided for the optimization problem, which can be computed efficiently. Several important practical issues are also tackled: 1) An often-overlooked tokenization mismatch issue is resolved with a simple prompt selection approach, 2) The combination of the optimized distribution and the vocabulary truncation technique is considered, and 3) The combination of the optimized distribution with other sequence-level selection heuristics to further enhance the efficiency and reliability is studied.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seongho Kim, Jihyun Moon, Juntaek Oh, Insu Choi, Joon-Sung Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of the Attention mechanism and Transformer architecture enables contextually natural text generation and compresses the burden of processing entire source information into singular vectors. Based on these two main ideas, model sizes gradually increases to accommodate more precise and comprehensive information, leading to the current state-of-the-art LLMs being very large, with parameters around 70 billion. As the model sizes are growing, the demand for substantial storage and computational capacity increases. This leads to the development of high-bandwidth memory and accelerators, as well as a variety of model architectures designed to meet these requirements. We note that LLM architectures have increasingly converged. This paper analyzes how these converged architectures perform in terms of layer configurations, operational mechanisms, and model sizes, considering various hyperparameter settings. In this paper, we conduct a concise survey of the history of LLMs by tracing the evolution of their operational improvements. Furthermore, we summarize the performance trends of LLMs under various hyperparameter settings using the RTX 6000, which features the state-of-the-art Ada Lovelace architecture. We conclude that even the same model can exhibit different behaviors depending on the hyperparameters or whether it is deployed in server or edge environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeru Shi, Kai Mei, Mingyu Jin, Yongye Su, Chaoji Zuo, Wenyue Hua, Wujiang Xu, Yujie Ren, Zirui Liu, Mengnan Du, Dong Deng, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongxiao Xu, Solomon Abera Bekele, Brice Videau, Kai Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Energy consumption has become a critical design metric and a limiting factor in the development of future computing architectures, from small wearable devices to large-scale leadership computing facilities. The predominant methods in energy management optimization are focused on CPUs. However, GPUs are increasingly significant and account for the majority of energy consumption in heterogeneous high performance computing (HPC) systems. Moreover, they typically rely on either purely offline training or a hybrid of offline and online training, which are impractical and lead to energy loss during data collection. Therefore, this paper studies a novel and practical online energy optimization problem for GPUs in HPC scenarios. The problem is challenging due to the inherent performance-energy trade-offs of GPUs, the exploration & exploitation dilemma across frequencies, and the lack of explicit performance counters in GPUs. To address these challenges, we formulate the online energy consumption optimization problem as a multi-armed bandit framework and develop a novel bandit based framework EnergyUCB. EnergyUCB is designed to dynamically adjust GPU core frequencies in real-time, reducing energy consumption with minimal impact on performance. Specifically, the proposed framework EnergyUCB (1) balances the performance-energy trade-off in the reward function, (2) effectively navigates the exploration & exploitation dilemma when adjusting GPU core frequencies online, and (3) leverages the ratio of GPU core utilization to uncore utilization as a real-time GPU performance metric. Experiments on a wide range of real-world HPC benchmarks demonstrate that EnergyUCB can achieve substantial energy savings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyuan Xu, Kuo-Chin Lien, Tobias H\"ollerer</p>
<p>Abstract: When designing an AI-assisted decision-making system, there is often a tradeoff between precision and recall in the AI's recommendations. We argue that careful exploitation of this tradeoff can harness the complementary strengths in the human-AI collaboration to significantly improve team performance. We investigate a real-world video anonymization task for which recall is paramount and more costly to improve. We analyze the performance of 78 professional annotators working with a) no AI assistance, b) a high-precision "restrained" AI, and c) a high-recall "zealous" AI in over 3,466 person-hours of annotation work. In comparison, the zealous AI helps human teammates achieve significantly shorter task completion time and higher recall. In a follow-up study, we remove AI assistance for everyone and find negative training effects on annotators trained with the restrained AI. These findings and our analysis point to important implications for the design of AI assistance in recall-demanding scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takato Hayashi, Ryusei Kimura, Ryo Ishii, Shogo Okada</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic rapport estimation in social interactions is a central component of affective computing. Recent reports have shown that the estimation performance of rapport in initial interactions can be improved by using the participant's personality traits as the model's input. In this study, we investigate whether this findings applies to interactions between friends by developing rapport estimation models that utilize nonverbal cues (audio and facial expressions) as inputs. Our experimental results show that adding Big Five features (BFFs) to nonverbal features can improve the estimation performance of self-reported rapport in dyadic interactions between friends. Next, we demystify how BFFs improve the estimation performance of rapport through a comparative analysis between models with and without BFFs. We decompose rapport ratings into perceiver effects (people's tendency to rate other people), target effects (people's tendency to be rated by other people), and relationship effects (people's unique ratings for a specific person) using the social relations model. We then analyze the extent to which BFFs contribute to capturing each effect. Our analysis demonstrates that the perceiver's and the target's BFFs lead estimation models to capture the perceiver and the target effects, respectively. Furthermore, our experimental results indicate that the combinations of facial expression features and BFFs achieve best estimation performances not only in estimating rapport ratings, but also in estimating three effects. Our study is the first step toward understanding why personality-aware estimation models of interpersonal perception accomplish high estimation performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop an iterative assistant we call ChatVis that can synthetically generate Python scripts for data analysis and visualization using a large language model (LLM). The assistant allows a user to specify the operations in natural language, attempting to generate a Python script for the desired operations, prompting the LLM to revise the script as needed until it executes correctly. The iterations include an error detection and correction mechanism that extracts error messages from the execution of the script and subsequently prompts LLM to correct the error. Our method demonstrates correct execution on five canonical visualization scenarios, comparing results with ground truth. We also compared our results with scripts generated by several other LLMs without any assistance. In every instance, ChatVis successfully generated the correct script, whereas the unassisted LLMs failed to do so. The code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/tanwimallick/ChatVis/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Mossbridge</p>
<p>Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, the current paradigm of treating AI as a passive tool no longer suffices. As a human-AI team, we together advocate for a shift toward viewing AI as a learning partner, akin to a student who learns from interactions with humans. Drawing from interdisciplinary concepts such as ecorithms, order from chaos, and cooperation, we explore how AI can evolve and adapt in unpredictable environments. Arising from these brief explorations, we present two key recommendations: (1) foster ethical, cooperative treatment of AI to benefit both humans and AI, and (2) leverage the inherent heterogeneity between human and AI minds to create a synergistic hybrid intelligence. By reframing AI as a dynamic partner, a model emerges in which AI systems develop alongside humans, learning from human interactions and feedback loops including reflections on team conversations. Drawing from a transpersonal and interdependent approach to consciousness, we suggest that a "third mind" emerges through collaborative human-AI relationships. Through design interventions such as interactive learning and conversational debriefing and foundational interventions allowing AI to model multiple types of minds, we hope to provide a path toward more adaptive, ethical, and emotionally healthy human-AI relationships. We believe this dynamic relational learning-partner (DRLP) model for human-AI teaming, if enacted carefully, will improve our capacity to address powerful solutions to seemingly intractable problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the growing reliance on digital devices equipped with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), such as computers and smartphones, the need for effective automation tools has become increasingly important. Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V excel at tasks such as drafting emails, they struggle with GUI interactions, which limits their effectiveness in automating everyday tasks. In this paper, we introduce ClickAgent, a novel framework for building autonomous agents. In ClickAgent, the MLLM handles reasoning and action planning, while a separate UI location model (e.g., SeeClick) identifies the relevant UI elements on the screen. This approach addresses a key limitation of current-generation MLLMs: their difficulty in accurately locating UI elements.
  ClickAgent significantly outperforms other prompt-based autonomous agents (such as CogAgent, AppAgent, and Auto-UI) on the AITW benchmark. Our evaluation was conducted on both an Android smartphone emulator and an actual Android smartphone, using the task success rate as the key metric for measuring agent performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based conversational agents has resulted in excessive disclosure of identifiable or sensitive information. However, existing technologies fail to offer perceptible control or account for users' personal preferences about privacy-utility tradeoffs due to the lack of user involvement. To bridge this gap, we designed, built, and evaluated Rescriber, a browser extension that supports user-led data minimization in LLM-based conversational agents by helping users detect and sanitize personal information in their prompts. Our studies (N=12) showed that Rescriber helped users reduce unnecessary disclosure and addressed their privacy concerns. Users' subjective perceptions of the system powered by Llama3-8B were on par with that by GPT-4. The comprehensiveness and consistency of the detection and sanitization emerge as essential factors that affect users' trust and perceived protection. Our findings confirm the viability of smaller-LLM-powered, user-facing, on-device privacy controls, presenting a promising approach to address the privacy and trust challenges of AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Creativity involves not only generating new ideas from scratch but also redefining existing concepts and synthesizing previous insights. Among various techniques developed to foster creative thinking, brainstorming is widely used. With recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), tools like ChatGPT have significantly impacted various fields by using prompts to facilitate complex tasks. While current research primarily focuses on generating accurate responses, there is a need to explore how prompt engineering can enhance creativity, particularly in brainstorming. Therefore, this study addresses this gap by proposing a framework called GPS, which employs goals, prompts, and strategies to guide designers to systematically work with an LLM tool for improving the creativity of ideas generated during brainstorming. Additionally, we adapted the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) for measuring the creativity of the ideas generated by AI. Our framework, tested through a design example and a case study, demonstrates its effectiveness in stimulating creativity and its seamless LLM tool integration into design practices. The results indicate that our framework can benefit brainstorming sessions with LLM tools, enhancing both the creativity and usefulness of generated ideas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyi Yang, Xinchao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new learning paradigm termed Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta), which aims to build self-morphable neural networks. Contrary to crafting separate models for different architectures or sizes, NeuMeta directly learns the continuous weight manifold of neural networks. Once trained, we can sample weights for any-sized network directly from the manifold, even for previously unseen configurations, without retraining. To achieve this ambitious goal, NeuMeta trains neural implicit functions as hypernetworks. They accept coordinates within the model space as input, and generate corresponding weight values on the manifold. In other words, the implicit function is learned in a way, that the predicted weights is well-performed across various models sizes. In training those models, we notice that, the final performance closely relates on smoothness of the learned manifold. In pursuit of enhancing this smoothness, we employ two strategies. First, we permute weight matrices to achieve intra-model smoothness, by solving the Shortest Hamiltonian Path problem. Besides, we add a noise on the input coordinates when training the implicit function, ensuring models with various sizes shows consistent outputs. As such, NeuMeta shows promising results in synthesizing parameters for various network configurations. Our extensive tests in image classification, semantic segmentation, and image generation reveal that NeuMeta sustains full-size performance even at a 75% compression rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates whether the hexagonal structure of grid cells provides any performance benefits or if it merely represents a biologically convenient configuration. Utilizing the Vector-HaSH content addressable memory model as a model of the grid cell -- place cell network of the mammalian brain, we compare the performance of square and hexagonal grid cells in tasks of storing and retrieving spatial memories. Our experiments across different path types, path lengths and grid configurations, reveal that hexagonal grid cells perform similarly to square grid cells with respect to spatial representation and memory recall. Our results show comparable accuracy and robustness across different datasets and noise levels on images to recall. These findings suggest that the brain's use of hexagonal grids may be more a matter of biological convenience and ease of implementation rather than because they provide superior performance over square grid cells (which are easier to implement in silico).</p>

<p>Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is essential for building advanced machine learning-powered applications, especially in critical domains such as medical diagnostics or autonomous driving. Legal, business, and ethical requirements motivate using effective XAI, but the increasing number of different methods makes it challenging to pick the right ones. Further, as explanations are highly context-dependent, measuring the effectiveness of XAI methods without users can only reveal a limited amount of information, excluding human factors such as the ability to understand it. We propose to evaluate XAI methods via the user's ability to successfully perform a proxy task, designed such that a good performance is an indicator for the explanation to provide helpful information. In other words, we address the helpfulness of XAI for human decision-making. Further, a user study on state-of-the-art methods was conducted, showing differences in their ability to generate trust and skepticism and the ability to judge the rightfulness of an AI decision correctly. Based on the results, we highly recommend using and extending this approach for more objective-based human-centered user studies to measure XAI performance in an end-to-end fashion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ievgeniia Kuzminykh, Tareita Nawaz, Shihao Shenzhang, Bogdan Ghita, Jeffery Raphael, Hannan Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: AI tools, particularly large language modules, have recently proven their effectiveness within learning management systems and online education programmes. As feedback continues to play a crucial role in learning and assessment in schools, educators must carefully customise the use of AI tools in order to optimally support students in their learning journey. Efforts to improve educational feedback systems have seen numerous attempts reflected in the research studies but mostly have been focusing on qualitatively benchmarking AI feedback against human-generated feedback. This paper presents an exploration of an alternative feedback framework which extends the capabilities of ChatGPT by integrating embeddings, enabling a more nuanced understanding of educational materials and facilitating topic-targeted feedback for quiz-based assessments. As part of the study, we proposed and developed a proof of concept solution, achieving an efficacy rate of 90% and 100% for open-ended and multiple-choice questions, respectively. The results showed that our framework not only surpasses expectations but also rivals human narratives, highlighting the potential of AI in revolutionising educational feedback mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bolun Sun, Yifan Zhou, Haiyun Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of large language models (LLMs) to enhance user comprehension of privacy policies through an interactive dialogue agent. We demonstrate that LLMs significantly outperform traditional models in tasks like Data Practice Identification, Choice Identification, Policy Summarization, and Privacy Question Answering, setting new benchmarks in privacy policy analysis. Building on these findings, we introduce an innovative LLM-based agent that functions as an expert system for processing website privacy policies, guiding users through complex legal language without requiring them to pose specific questions. A user study with 100 participants showed that users assisted by the agent had higher comprehension levels (mean score of 2.6 out of 3 vs. 1.8 in the control group), reduced cognitive load (task difficulty ratings of 3.2 out of 10 vs. 7.8), increased confidence in managing privacy, and completed tasks in less time (5.5 minutes vs. 15.8 minutes). This work highlights the potential of LLM-based agents to transform user interaction with privacy policies, leading to more informed consent and empowering users in the digital services landscape.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sizhong Qin, Chengyu He, Qiaoyun Chen, Sen Yang, Wenjie Liao, Yi Gu, Xinzheng Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: The generation and editing of floor plans are critical in architectural planning, requiring a high degree of flexibility and efficiency. Existing methods demand extensive input information and lack the capability for interactive adaptation to user modifications. This paper introduces ChatHouseDiffusion, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret natural language input, employs graphormer to encode topological relationships, and uses diffusion models to flexibly generate and edit floor plans. This approach allows iterative design adjustments based on user ideas, significantly enhancing design efficiency. Compared to existing models, ChatHouseDiffusion achieves higher Intersection over Union (IoU) scores, permitting precise, localized adjustments without the need for complete redesigns, thus offering greater practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our model not only strictly adheres to user specifications but also facilitates a more intuitive design process through its interactive capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Hussein, Mukesh Prasad, Ali Braytee</p>
<p>Abstract: Advancements in high-throughput technologies have led to a shift from traditional hypothesis-driven methodologies to data-driven approaches. Multi-omics refers to the integrative analysis of data derived from multiple 'omes', such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics. This approach enables a comprehensive understanding of biological systems by capturing different layers of biological information. Deep learning methods are increasingly utilized to integrate multi-omics data, offering insights into molecular interactions and enhancing research into complex diseases. However, these models, with their numerous interconnected layers and nonlinear relationships, often function as black boxes, lacking transparency in decision-making processes. To overcome this challenge, explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods are crucial for creating transparent models that allow clinicians to interpret and work with complex data more effectively. This review explores how xAI can improve the interpretability of deep learning models in multi-omics research, highlighting its potential to provide clinicians with clear insights, thereby facilitating the effective application of such models in clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Beka Modrekiladze</p>
<p>Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has opened unparalleled opportunities for observing the universe, particularly through the study of black hole inspirals. These events serve as unique laboratories to explore the laws of physics under conditions of extreme energies. However, significant noise in gravitational wave (GW) data from observatories such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo poses major challenges in signal identification. Traditional noise suppression methods often fall short in fully addressing the non-Gaussian effects in the data, including the fluctuations in noise power spectral density (PSD) over short time intervals. These challenges have led to the exploration of an AI approach that, while overcoming previous obstacles, introduced its own challenges, such as scalability, reliability issues, and the vanishing gradient problem. Our approach addresses these issues through a simplified architecture. To compensate for the potential limitations of a simpler model, we have developed a novel training methodology that enables it to accurately detect gravitational waves amidst highly complex noise. Employing this strategy, our model achieves over 99% accuracy in non-white noise scenarios and shows remarkable adaptability to changing noise PSD conditions. By leveraging the principles of transfer learning, our model quickly adapts to new noise profiles with just a few epochs of fine-tuning, facilitating real-time applications in dynamically changing noise environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Xu, Artem Moskalev, Tommaso Mansi, Mangal Prakash, Rui Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA properties, such as stability and interactions, is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological processes and developing RNA-based therapeutics. RNA structures can be represented as 1D sequences, 2D topological graphs, or 3D all-atom models, each offering different insights into its function. Existing works predominantly focus on 1D sequence-based models, which overlook the geometric context provided by 2D and 3D geometries. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of incorporating explicit 2D and 3D geometric information into RNA property prediction, considering not only performance but also real-world challenges such as limited data availability, partial labeling, sequencing noise, and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a newly curated set of RNA datasets with enhanced 2D and 3D structural annotations, providing a resource for model evaluation on RNA data. Our findings reveal that models with explicit geometry encoding generally outperform sequence-based models, with an average prediction RMSE reduction of around 12% across all various RNA tasks and excelling in low-data and partial labeling regimes, underscoring the value of explicitly incorporating geometric context. On the other hand, geometry-unaware sequence-based models are more robust under sequencing noise but often require around 2-5x training data to match the performance of geometry-aware models. Our study offers further insights into the trade-offs between different RNA representations in practical applications and addresses a significant gap in evaluating deep learning models for RNA tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingqing Cao, Mahyar Najibi, Sachin Mehta</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining robust vision or multimodal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) relies on large-scale datasets that may be noisy, potentially misaligned, and have long-tail distributions. Previous works have shown promising results in augmenting datasets by generating synthetic samples. However, they only support domain-specific ad hoc use cases (e.g., either image or text only, but not both), and are limited in data diversity due to a lack of fine-grained control over the synthesis process. In this paper, we design a \emph{controllable} image-text synthesis pipeline, CtrlSynth, for data-efficient and robust multimodal learning. The key idea is to decompose the visual semantics of an image into basic elements, apply user-specified control policies (e.g., remove, add, or replace operations), and recompose them to synthesize images or texts. The decompose and recompose feature in CtrlSynth allows users to control data synthesis in a fine-grained manner by defining customized control policies to manipulate the basic elements. CtrlSynth leverages the capabilities of pretrained foundation models such as large language models or diffusion models to reason and recompose basic elements such that synthetic samples are natural and composed in diverse ways. CtrlSynth is a closed-loop, training-free, and modular framework, making it easy to support different pretrained models. With extensive experiments on 31 datasets spanning different vision and vision-language tasks, we show that CtrlSynth substantially improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and compositional reasoning performance of CLIP models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Risheek Garrepalli, Shweta Mahajan, Munawar Hayat, Fatih Porikli</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generative modeling (e.g., text-to-image) but sampling requires multiple denoising network passes, limiting practicality. Efforts such as progressive distillation or consistency distillation have shown promise by reducing the number of passes at the expense of quality of the generated samples. In this work we identify co-variate shift as one of reason for poor performance of multi-step distilled models from compounding error at inference time. To address co-variate shift, we formulate diffusion distillation within imitation learning (DDIL) framework and enhance training distribution for distilling diffusion models on both data distribution (forward diffusion) and student induced distributions (backward diffusion). Training on data distribution helps to diversify the generations by preserving marginal data distribution and training on student distribution addresses compounding error by correcting covariate shift. In addition, we adopt reflected diffusion formulation for distillation and demonstrate improved performance, stable training across different distillation methods. We show that DDIL consistency improves on baseline algorithms of progressive distillation (PD), Latent consistency models (LCM) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD2).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Pinto, Tomer Galanti, Randall Balestriero</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in real-world applications, yet little is known about their training dynamics at the token level. Evaluation typically relies on aggregated training loss, measured at the batch level, which overlooks subtle per-token biases arising from (i) varying token-level dynamics and (ii) structural biases introduced by hyperparameters. While weight decay is commonly used to stabilize training, we reveal that it silently introduces performance biases detectable only at the token level. In fact, we empirically show across different dataset sizes, model architectures and sizes ranging from 270M to 3B parameters that as weight decay increases, low-frequency tokens are disproportionately depreciated. This is particularly concerning, as these neglected low-frequency tokens represent the vast majority of the token distribution in most languages, calling for novel regularization techniques that ensure fairness across all available tokens.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work contributes to breast cancer sub-type classification using histopathological images. We utilize masked autoencoders (MAEs) to learn a self-supervised embedding tailored for computer vision tasks in this domain. This embedding captures informative representations of histopathological data, facilitating feature learning without extensive labeled datasets. During pre-training, we investigate employing a random crop technique to generate a large dataset from WSIs automatically. Additionally, we assess the performance of linear probes for multi-class classification tasks of cancer sub-types using the representations learnt by the MAE. Our approach aims to achieve strong performance on downstream tasks by leveraging the complementary strengths of ViTs and autoencoders. We evaluate our model's performance on the BRACS dataset and compare it with existing benchmarks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12010">Bias Similarity Across Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyejun Jeong, Shiqing Ma, Amir Houmansadr</p>
<p>Abstract: Bias in machine learning models has been a chronic problem, especially as these models influence decision-making in human society. In generative AI, such as Large Language Models, the impact of bias is even more profound compared to the classification models. LLMs produce realistic and human-like content that users may unconsciously trust, which could perpetuate harmful stereotypes to the uncontrolled public. It becomes particularly concerning when utilized in journalism or education. While prior studies have explored and quantified bias in individual AI models, no work has yet compared bias similarity across different LLMs. To fill this gap, we take a comprehensive look at ten open- and closed-source LLMs from four model families, assessing the extent of biases through output distribution. Using two datasets-one containing 4k questions and another with one million questions for each of the four bias dimensions -- we measure functional similarity to understand how biases manifest across models. Our findings reveal that 1) fine-tuning does not significantly alter output distributions, which would limit its ability to mitigate bias, 2) LLMs within the same family tree do not produce similar output distributions, implying that addressing bias in one model could have limited implications for others in the same family, and 3) there is a possible risk of training data information leakage, raising concerns about privacy and data security. Our analysis provides insight into LLM behavior and highlights potential risks in real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanyue Xie, Zhi Zhang, Ding Zhou, Cong Xie, Ziang Song, Xin Liu, Yanzhi Wang, Xue Lin, An Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures face challenges such as high memory consumption and redundancy in experts. Pruning MoE can reduce network weights while maintaining model performance. Motivated by the recent observation of emergent large magnitude features in Large Language Models (LLM) and MoE routing policy, we propose MoE-Pruner, a method that prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes multiplied by the corresponding input activations and router weights, on each output neuron. Our pruning method is one-shot, requiring no retraining or weight updates. We evaluate our method on Mixtral-8x7B and Mixtral-8x22B across multiple language benchmarks. Experimental results show that our pruning method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM pruning methods. Furthermore, our pruned MoE models can benefit from a pretrained teacher model through expert-wise knowledge distillation, improving performance post-pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Mixtral-8x7B model with 50% sparsity maintains 99% of the performance of the original model after the expert-wise knowledge distillation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tabular data, widely used in industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation, presents unique challenges for deep learning due to its heterogeneous nature and lack of spatial structure. This survey reviews the evolution of deep learning models for tabular data, from early fully connected networks (FCNs) to advanced architectures like TabNet, SAINT, TabTranSELU, and MambaNet. These models incorporate attention mechanisms, feature embeddings, and hybrid architectures to address tabular data complexities. TabNet uses sequential attention for instance-wise feature selection, improving interpretability, while SAINT combines self-attention and intersample attention to capture complex interactions across features and data points, both advancing scalability and reducing computational overhead. Hybrid architectures such as TabTransformer and FT-Transformer integrate attention mechanisms with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to handle categorical and numerical data, with FT-Transformer adapting transformers for tabular datasets. Research continues to balance performance and efficiency for large datasets. Graph-based models like GNN4TDL and GANDALF combine neural networks with decision trees or graph structures, enhancing feature representation and mitigating overfitting in small datasets through advanced regularization techniques. Diffusion-based models like the Tabular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (TabDDPM) generate synthetic data to address data scarcity, improving model robustness. Similarly, models like TabPFN and Ptab leverage pre-trained language models, incorporating transfer learning and self-supervised techniques into tabular tasks. This survey highlights key advancements and outlines future research directions on scalability, generalization, and interpretability in diverse tabular data applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable proficiency in reasoning, there is still a concern about hallucinations and unreliable reasoning issues due to semantic associations and superficial logical chains. To evaluate the extent to which LLMs perform robust reasoning instead of relying on superficial logical chains, we propose a new evaluation dataset, the Concept-Reversed Winograd Schema Challenge (CR-WSC), based on the famous Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) dataset. By simply reversing the concepts to those that are more associated with the wrong answer, we find that the performance of LLMs drops significantly despite the rationale of reasoning remaining the same. Furthermore, we propose Abstraction-of-Thought (AoT), a novel prompt method for recovering adversarial cases to normal cases using conceptual abstraction to improve LLMs' robustness and consistency in reasoning, as demonstrated by experiments on CR-WSC.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fake news threatens democracy and exacerbates the polarization and divisions in society; therefore, accurately detecting online misinformation is the foundation of addressing this issue. We present CrediRAG, the first fake news detection model that combines language models with access to a rich external political knowledge base with a dense social network to detect fake news across social media at scale. CrediRAG uses a news retriever to initially assign a misinformation score to each post based on the source credibility of similar news articles to the post title content. CrediRAG then improves the initial retrieval estimations through a novel weighted post-to-post network connected based on shared commenters and weighted by the average stance of all shared commenters across every pair of posts. We achieve 11% increase in the F1-score in detecting misinformative posts over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments conducted on curated real-world Reddit data of over 200,000 posts demonstrate the superior performance of CrediRAG on existing baselines. Thus, our approach offers a more accurate and scalable solution to combat the spread of fake news across social media platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiushi Lin, Hang Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a decentralized version of Moving Agents in Formation (MAiF), a variant of Multi-Agent Path Finding aiming to plan collision-free paths for multiple agents with the dual objectives of reaching their goals quickly while maintaining a desired formation. The agents must balance these objectives under conditions of partial observation and limited communication. The formation maintenance depends on the joint state of all agents, whose dimensionality increases exponentially with the number of agents, rendering the learning process intractable. Additionally, learning a single policy that can accommodate different linear preferences for these two objectives presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose Mean-Field Control with Envelop $Q$-learning (MFC-EQ), a scalable and adaptable learning framework for this bi-objective multi-agent problem. We approximate the dynamics of all agents using mean-field theory while learning a universal preference-agnostic policy through envelop $Q$-learning. Our empirical evaluation of MFC-EQ across numerous instances shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art centralized MAiF baselines. Furthermore, MFC-EQ effectively handles more complex scenarios where the desired formation changes dynamically -- a challenge that existing MAiF planners cannot address.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan Dang, Khang Nguyen, Mandfred Huber</p>
<p>Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in highly dynamic environments is challenging due to the correlation complexity between moving objects and the camera pose. Many methods have been proposed to deal with this problem; however, the moving properties of dynamic objects with a moving camera remain unclear. Therefore, to improve SLAM's performance, minimizing disruptive events of moving objects with a physical understanding of 3D shapes and dynamics of objects is needed. In this paper, we propose a robust method, V3D-SLAM, to remove moving objects via two lightweight re-evaluation stages, including identifying potentially moving and static objects using a spatial-reasoned Hough voting mechanism and refining static objects by detecting dynamic noise caused by intra-object motions using Chamfer distances as similarity measurements. Our experiment on the TUM RGB-D benchmark on dynamic sequences with ground-truth camera trajectories showed that our methods outperform the most recent state-of-the-art SLAM methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghao Qian, Yuhu Guo, Yuhong Mo, Wenjing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely WeatherDG, that can generate realistic, weather-diverse, and driving-screen images based on the cooperation of two foundation models, i.e, Stable Diffusion (SD) and Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we first fine-tune the SD with source data, aligning the content and layout of generated samples with real-world driving scenarios. Then, we propose a procedural prompt generation method based on LLM, which can enrich scenario descriptions and help SD automatically generate more diverse, detailed images. In addition, we introduce a balanced generation strategy, which encourages the SD to generate high-quality objects of tailed classes under various weather conditions, such as riders and motorcycles. This segmentation-model-agnostic method can improve the generalization ability of existing models by additionally adapting them with the generated synthetic data. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method can significantly improve the segmentation performance of different state-of-the-art models on target domains. Notably, in the setting of ''Cityscapes to ACDC'', our method improves the baseline HRDA by 13.9% in mIoU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengyu Gao, Ruida Zhou, Tianhao Wang, Cong Shen, Jing Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the contextual information embedded in examples/demonstrations to perform in-context learning (ICL). To mitigate the risk of LLMs potentially leaking private information contained in examples in the prompt, we introduce a novel data-adaptive differentially private algorithm called AdaDPSyn to generate synthetic examples from the private dataset and then use these synthetic examples to perform ICL. The objective of AdaDPSyn is to adaptively adjust the noise level in the data synthesis mechanism according to the inherent statistical properties of the data, thereby preserving high ICL accuracy while maintaining formal differential privacy guarantees. A key innovation in AdaDPSyn is the Precision-Focused Iterative Radius Reduction technique, which dynamically refines the aggregation radius - the scope of data grouping for noise addition - based on patterns observed in data clustering, thereby minimizing the amount of additive noise. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and compare AdaDPSyn with DP few-shot generation algorithm (Tang et al., 2023). The experiments demonstrate that AdaDPSyn not only outperforms DP few-shot generation, but also maintains high accuracy levels close to those of non-private baselines, providing an effective solution for ICL with privacy protection.</p>

<p>Abstract: his paper explores what kinds of questions are best served by the way generative AI (GenAI) using Large Language Models(LLMs) that aggregate and package knowledge, and when traditional curated web-sourced search results serve users better.
  An experiment compared product searches using ChatGPT, Google search engine, or both helped us understand more about the compelling nature of generated responses. The experiment showed GenAI can speed up some explorations and decisions. We describe how search can deepen the testing of facts, logic, and context. We show where existing and emerging knowledge paradigms can help knowledge exploration in different ways.
  Experimenting with searches, our probes showed the value for curated web search provides for very specific, less popularly-known knowledge. GenAI excelled at bringing together knowledge for broad, relatively well-known topics. The value of curated and aggregated knowledge for different kinds of knowledge reflected in different user goals. We developed a taxonomy to distinguishing when users are best served by these two approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangxin Su, Yifan Zhu, Wenjie Zhang, Hanchen Wang, Ying Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning, involving both node features and graph structures, is crucial for real-world applications but often encounters pervasive noise. State-of-the-art methods typically address noise by focusing separately on node features with large language models (LLMs) and on graph structures with graph structure learning models (GSLMs). In this paper, we introduce LangGSL, a robust framework that integrates the complementary strengths of pre-trained language models and GSLMs to jointly enhance both node feature and graph structure learning. In LangGSL, we first leverage LLMs to filter noise in the raw data and extract valuable cleaned information as features, enhancing the synergy of downstream models. During the mutual learning phase in LangGSL, the core idea is to leverage the relatively small language model (LM) to process local attributes and generate reliable pseudo-labels and informative node embeddings, which are then integrated into the GSLM's prediction phase. This approach enriches the global context and enhances overall performance. Meanwhile, GSLM refines the evolving graph structure constructed from the LM's output, offering updated labels back to the LM as additional guidance, thus facilitating a more effective mutual learning process. The LM and GSLM work synergistically, complementing each other's strengths and offsetting weaknesses within a variational information-maximizing framework, resulting in enhanced node features and a more robust graph structure. Extensive experiments on diverse graph datasets of varying scales and across different task scenarios demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Cowsik, Kfir Dolev, Alex Infanger</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a complete mechanistic description of the algorithm learned by a minimal non-linear sparse data autoencoder in the limit of large input dimension. The model, originally presented in arXiv:2209.10652, compresses sparse data vectors through a linear layer and decompresses using another linear layer followed by a ReLU activation. We notice that when the data is permutation symmetric (no input feature is privileged) large models reliably learn an algorithm that is sensitive to individual weights only through their large-scale statistics. For these models, the loss function becomes analytically tractable. Using this understanding, we give the explicit scalings of the loss at high sparsity, and show that the model is near-optimal among recently proposed architectures. In particular, changing or adding to the activation function any elementwise or filtering operation can at best improve the model's performance by a constant factor. Finally, we forward-engineer a model with the requisite symmetries and show that its loss precisely matches that of the trained models. Unlike the trained model weights, the low randomness in the artificial weights results in miraculous fractal structures resembling a Persian rug, to which the algorithm is oblivious. Our work contributes to neural network interpretability by introducing techniques for understanding the structure of autoencoders.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuze Jiang, Beijun Shen, Xiaodong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: For predicting software defects at an early stage, researchers have proposed just-in-time defect prediction (JIT-DP) to identify potential defects in code commits. The prevailing approaches train models to represent code changes in history commits and utilize the learned representations to predict the presence of defects in the latest commit. However, existing models merely learn editions in source code, without considering the natural language intentions behind the changes. This limitation hinders their ability to capture deeper semantics. To address this, we introduce a novel bi-modal change pre-training model called BiCC-BERT. BiCC-BERT is pre-trained on a code change corpus to learn bi-modal semantic representations. To incorporate commit messages from the corpus, we design a novel pre-training objective called Replaced Message Identification (RMI), which learns the semantic association between commit messages and code changes. Subsequently, we integrate BiCC-BERT into JIT-DP and propose a new defect prediction approach -- JIT-BiCC. By leveraging the bi-modal representations from BiCC-BERT, JIT-BiCC captures more profound change semantics. We train JIT-BiCC using 27,391 code changes and compare its performance with 8 state-of-the-art JIT-DP approaches. The results demonstrate that JIT-BiCC outperforms all baselines, achieving a 10.8% improvement in F1-score. This highlights its effectiveness in learning the bi-modal semantics for JIT-DP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krishan Rana, Jad Abou-Chakra, Sourav Garg, Robert Lee, Ian Reid, Niko Suenderhauf</p>
<p>Abstract: Affordances are central to robotic manipulation, where most tasks can be simplified to interactions with task-specific regions on objects. By focusing on these key regions, we can abstract away task-irrelevant information, simplifying the learning process, and enhancing generalisation. In this paper, we propose an affordance-centric policy-learning approach that centres and appropriately \textit{orients} a \textit{task frame} on these affordance regions allowing us to achieve both \textbf{intra-category invariance} -- where policies can generalise across different instances within the same object category -- and \textbf{spatial invariance} -- which enables consistent performance regardless of object placement in the environment. We propose a method to leverage existing generalist large vision models to extract and track these affordance frames, and demonstrate that our approach can learn manipulation tasks using behaviour cloning from as little as 10 demonstrations, with equivalent generalisation to an image-based policy trained on 305 demonstrations. We provide video demonstrations on our project site: https://affordance-policy.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huiwen Wu, Xiaohan Li, Xiaogang Xu, Jiafei Wu, Deyi Zhang, Zhe Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced various AI applications in commercial and scientific research fields, such as scientific literature summarization, writing assistance, and knowledge graph construction. However, a significant challenge is the high risk of hallucination during LLM inference, which can lead to security concerns like factual inaccuracies, inconsistent information, and fabricated content. To tackle this issue, it is essential to develop effective methods for reducing hallucination while maintaining the original capabilities of the LLM. This paper introduces a novel approach called Iterative Model-level Contrastive Learning (Iter-AHMCL) to address hallucination. This method modifies the representation layers of pre-trained LLMs by using contrastive `positive' and `negative' models, trained on data with and without hallucinations. By leveraging the differences between these two models, we create a more straightforward pathway to eliminate hallucinations, and the iterative nature of contrastive learning further enhances performance. Experimental validation on four pre-trained foundation LLMs (LLaMA2, Alpaca, LLaMA3, and Qwen) finetuning with a specially designed dataset shows that our approach achieves an average improvement of 10.1 points on the TruthfulQA benchmark. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Iter-AHMCL in reducing hallucination while maintaining the general capabilities of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiannis Kantaros, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning optimal control policies for systems with uncertain dynamics and high-level control objectives specified as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. Uncertainty is considered in the workspace structure and the outcomes of control decisions giving rise to an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP). Existing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for LTL tasks typically rely on exploring a product MDP state-space uniformly (using e.g., an $\epsilon$-greedy policy) compromising sample-efficiency. This issue becomes more pronounced as the rewards get sparser and the MDP size or the task complexity increase. In this paper, we propose an accelerated RL algorithm that can learn control policies significantly faster than competitive approaches. Its sample-efficiency relies on a novel task-driven exploration strategy that biases exploration towards directions that may contribute to task satisfaction. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive comparative experiments demonstrating the sample-efficiency of the proposed method. The benefit of our method becomes more evident as the task complexity or the MDP size increases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wells Lucas Santo</p>
<p>Abstract: How is identity constructed and performed in the digital via face-based artificial intelligence technologies? While questions of identity on the textual Internet have been thoroughly explored, the Internet has progressed to a multimedia form that not only centers the visual, but specifically the face. At the same time, a wealth of scholarship has and continues to center the topics of surveillance and control through facial recognition technologies (FRTs), which have extended the logics of the racist pseudoscience of physiognomy. Much less work has been devoted to understanding how such face-based artificial intelligence technologies have influenced the formation and performance of identity. This literature review considers how such technologies interact with faciality, which entails the construction of what a face may represent or signify, along axes of identity such as race, gender, and sexuality. In grappling with recent advances in AI such as image generation and deepfakes, I propose that we are now in an era of "post-facial" technologies that build off our existing culture of facility while eschewing the analog face, complicating our relationship with identity vis-a-vis the face. Drawing from previous frameworks of identity play in the digital, as well as trans practices that have historically played with or transgressed the boundaries of identity classification, we can develop concepts adequate for analyzing digital faciality and identity given the current landscape of post-facial artificial intelligence technologies that allow users to interface with the digital in an entirely novel manner. To ground this framework of transgression, I conclude by proposing an interview study with VTubers -- online streamers who perform using motion-captured avatars instead of their real-life faces -- to gain qualitative insight on how these sociotechnical experiences.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach termed Layer-of-Thoughts Prompting (LoT), which utilizes constraint hierarchies to filter and refine candidate responses to a given query. By integrating these constraints, our method enables a structured retrieval process that enhances explainability and automation. Existing methods have explored various prompting techniques but often present overly generalized frameworks without delving into the nuances of prompts in multi-turn interactions. Our work addresses this gap by focusing on the hierarchical relationships among prompts. We demonstrate that the efficacy of thought hierarchy plays a critical role in developing efficient and interpretable retrieval algorithms. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), LoT significantly improves the accuracy and comprehensibility of information retrieval tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statutory law retrieval is a typical problem in legal language processing, that has various practical applications in law engineering. Modern deep learning-based retrieval methods have achieved significant results for this problem. However, retrieval systems relying on semantic and lexical correlations often exhibit limitations, particularly when handling queries that involve real-life scenarios, or use the vocabulary that is not specific to the legal domain. In this work, we focus on overcoming this weaknesses by utilizing the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to identify relevant legal terms and facts related to the situation mentioned in the query. The proposed retrieval system integrates additional information from the term--based expansion and query reformulation to improve the retrieval accuracy. The experiments on COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 datasets show that extra knowledge from LLMs helps to improve the retrieval result of both lexical and semantic ranking models. The final ensemble retrieval system outperformed the highest results among all participating teams in the COLIEE 2022 and 2023 competitions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial step in many modern-day scientific applications including drug discovery and energy storage material design. Despite the availability of numerous machine learning models for this task, we are lacking in models that provide both high accuracies and interpretability of the predictions. We introduce the FragNet architecture, a graph neural network not only capable of achieving prediction accuracies comparable to the current state-of-the-art models, but also able to provide insight on four levels of molecular substructures. This model enables understanding of which atoms, bonds, molecular fragments, and molecular fragment connections are critical in the prediction of a given molecular property. The ability to interpret the importance of connections between fragments is of particular interest for molecules which have substructures that are not connected with regular covalent bonds. The interpretable capabilities of FragNet are key to gaining scientific insights from the model's learned patterns between molecular structure and molecular properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Liang, Weishan Ye, Qile Liu, Li Zhang, Gan Huang, Yongjie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious threat to the physical and mental health of adolescents, significantly increasing the risk of suicide and attracting widespread public concern. Electroencephalography (EEG), as an objective tool for identifying brain disorders, holds great promise. However, extracting meaningful and reliable features from high-dimensional EEG data, especially by integrating spatiotemporal brain dynamics into informative representations, remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce an advanced semi-supervised adversarial network, NSSI-Net, to effectively model EEG features related to NSSI. NSSI-Net consists of two key modules: a spatial-temporal feature extraction module and a multi-concept discriminator. In the spatial-temporal feature extraction module, an integrated 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) and a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) are used to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics in EEG data. In the multi-concept discriminator, signal, gender, domain, and disease levels are fully explored to extract meaningful EEG features, considering individual, demographic, disease variations across a diverse population. Based on self-collected NSSI data (n=114), the model's effectiveness and reliability are demonstrated, with a 7.44% improvement in performance compared to existing machine learning and deep learning methods. This study advances the understanding and early diagnosis of NSSI in adolescents with depression, enabling timely intervention.

<p>Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence models, such as Large Video-Language models (VLMs), grow in size, their deployment in real-world applications becomes increasingly challenging due to hardware limitations and computational costs. To address this, we design a hybrid edge-cloud solution that leverages the efficiency of smaller models for local processing while deferring to larger, more accurate cloud-based models when necessary. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised data generation method, Dual-Model Distillation (DMD), to train a lightweight switcher model that can predict when the edge model's output is uncertain and selectively offload inference to the large model in the cloud. Experimental results on the action classification task show that our framework not only requires less computational overhead, but also improves accuracy compared to using a large model alone. Our framework provides a scalable and adaptable solution for action classification in resource-constrained environments, with potential applications beyond healthcare. Noteworthy, while DMD-generated data is used for optimizing performance and resource usage in our pipeline, we expect the concept of DMD to further support future research on knowledge alignment across multiple models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tales H. Carvalho, Kenneth Tjhia, Levi H. S. Lelis</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have introduced LEAPS and HPRL, systems that learn latent spaces of domain-specific languages, which are used to define programmatic policies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). These systems induce a latent space while optimizing losses such as the behavior loss, which aim to achieve locality in program behavior, meaning that vectors close in the latent space should correspond to similarly behaving programs. In this paper, we show that the programmatic space, induced by the domain-specific language and requiring no training, presents values for the behavior loss similar to those observed in latent spaces presented in previous work. Moreover, algorithms searching in the programmatic space significantly outperform those in LEAPS and HPRL. To explain our results, we measured the "friendliness" of the two spaces to local search algorithms. We discovered that algorithms are more likely to stop at local maxima when searching in the latent space than when searching in the programmatic space. This implies that the optimization topology of the programmatic space, induced by the reward function in conjunction with the neighborhood function, is more conducive to search than that of the latent space. This result provides an explanation for the superior performance in the programmatic space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) and, more generally, $\omega$-regular objectives are alternatives to the traditional discount sum and average reward objectives in reinforcement learning (RL), offering the advantage of greater comprehensibility and hence explainability. In this work, we study the relationship between these objectives. Our main result is that each RL problem for $\omega$-regular objectives can be reduced to a limit-average reward problem in an optimality-preserving fashion, via (finite-memory) reward machines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by showing that optimal policies for limit-average problems can be found asymptotically by solving a sequence of discount-sum problems approximately. Consequently, we resolve an open problem: optimal policies for LTL and $\omega$-regular objectives can be learned asymptotically.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but face deployment challenges due to hardware constraints. We propose density-aware post-training weight-only quantization (DAQ), which has two stages: 1) density-centric alignment, which identifies the center of high-density weights and centers the dynamic range on this point to align high-density weight regions with floating-point high-precision regions; 2) learnable dynamic range adjustment, which adjusts the dynamic range by optimizing quantization parameters (i.e., scale and zero-point) based on the impact of weights on the model output. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 show that DAQ consistently outperforms the best baseline method, reducing perplexity loss by an average of 22.8% on LLaMA and 19.6% on LLaMA-2.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreya Shankar, Aditya G. Parameswaran, Eugene Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Analyzing unstructured data, such as complex documents, has been a persistent challenge in data processing. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in this regard, leading to recent proposals for declarative frameworks for LLM-powered unstructured data processing. However, these frameworks focus on reducing cost when executing user-specified operations using LLMs, rather than improving accuracy, executing most operations as-is. This is problematic for complex tasks and data, where LLM outputs for user-defined operations are often inaccurate, even with optimized prompts.
  We present DocETL, a system that optimizes complex document processing pipelines, while accounting for LLM shortcomings. DocETL offers a declarative interface for users to define such pipelines and uses an agent-based framework to automatically optimize them, leveraging novel agent-based rewrites (that we call {\em rewrite directives}) and an optimization and evaluation framework that we introduce. We introduce {\em (i)} logical rewriting of pipelines, tailored for LLM-based tasks, {\em (ii)} an agent-guided plan evaluation mechanism that synthesizes and orchestrates task-specific validation prompts, and {\em (iii)} an optimization algorithm that efficiently finds promising plans, considering the time constraints of LLM-based plan generation and evaluation. Our evaluation on three different unstructured document analysis tasks demonstrates that DocETL finds plans with outputs that are $1.34$ to $4.6\times$ higher quality (e.g., more accurate, comprehensive) than well-engineered baselines, addressing a critical gap in existing declarative frameworks for unstructured data analysis. DocETL is open-source at \ttt{docetl.org}, and as of October 2024, has amassed over 800 GitHub Stars, with users spanning a variety of domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghyeon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Fast kinodynamic motion planning is crucial for systems to effectively adapt to dynamically changing environments. Despite some efforts, existing approaches still struggle with rapid planning in high-dimensional, complex problems. Not surprisingly, the primary challenge arises from the high-dimensionality of the search space, specifically the trajectory space. We address this issue with a two-step method: initially, we identify a lower-dimensional trajectory manifold {\it offline}, comprising diverse trajectories specifically relevant to the task at hand while meeting kinodynamic constraints. Subsequently, we search for solutions within this manifold {\it online}, significantly enhancing the planning speed. To encode and generate a manifold of continuous-time, differentiable trajectories, we propose a novel neural network model, {\it Differentiable Motion Manifold Primitives (DMMP)}, along with a practical training strategy. Experiments with a 7-DoF robot arm tasked with dynamic throwing to arbitrary target positions demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in planning speed, task success, and constraint satisfaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Feng, Alexander Carballo, Kazuya Takeda</p>
<p>Abstract: Predicting pedestrian behavior is challenging yet crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and smart city. Recent deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in making accurate predictions, but they fail to provide explanations of their inner workings. One reason for this problem is the multi-modal inputs. To bridge this gap, we present Sparse Prototype Network (SPN), an explainable method designed to simultaneously predict a pedestrian's future action, trajectory, and pose. SPN leverages an intermediate prototype bottleneck layer to provide sample-based explanations for its predictions. The prototypes are modality-independent, meaning that they can correspond to any modality from the input. Therefore, SPN can extend to arbitrary combinations of modalities. Regularized by mono-semanticity and clustering constraints, the prototypes learn consistent and human-understandable features and achieve state-of-the-art performance on action, trajectory and pose prediction on TITAN and PIE. Finally, we propose a metric named Top-K Mono-semanticity Scale to quantitatively evaluate the explainability. Qualitative results show the positive correlation between sparsity and explainability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sinong Zhao, Wenrui Wang, Hongzuo Xu, Zhaoyang Yu, Qingsong Wen, Gang Wang, xiaoguang Liu, Guansong Pang</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying anomalies from time series data plays an important role in various fields such as infrastructure security, intelligent operation and maintenance, and space exploration. Current research focuses on detecting the anomalies after they occur, which can lead to significant financial/reputation loss or infrastructure damage. In this work we instead study a more practical yet very challenging problem, time series anomaly prediction, aiming at providing early warnings for abnormal events before their occurrence. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel principled approach, namely future context modeling (FCM). Its key insight is that the future abnormal events in a target window can be accurately predicted if their preceding observation window exhibits any subtle difference to normal data. To effectively capture such differences, FCM first leverages long-term forecasting models to generate a discriminative future context based on the observation data, aiming to amplify those subtle but unusual difference. It then models a normality correlation of the observation data with the forecasting future context to complement the normality modeling of the observation data in foreseeing possible abnormality in the target window. A joint variate-time attention learning is also introduced in FCM to leverage both temporal signals and features of the time series data for more discriminative normality modeling in the aforementioned two views. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that FCM gains good recall rate (70\%+) on multiple datasets and significantly outperforms all baselines in F1 score.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bin Wang, Anwesa Choudhuri, Meng Zheng, Zhongpai Gao, Benjamin Planche, Andong Deng, Qin Liu, Terrence Chen, Ulas Bagci, Ziyan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Interactive segmentation aims to accurately segment target objects with minimal user interactions. However, current methods often fail to accurately separate target objects from the background, due to a limited understanding of order, the relative depth between objects in a scene. To address this issue, we propose OIS: order-aware interactive segmentation, where we explicitly encode the relative depth between objects into order maps. We introduce a novel order-aware attention, where the order maps seamlessly guide the user interactions (in the form of clicks) to attend to the image features. We further present an object-aware attention module to incorporate a strong object-level understanding to better differentiate objects with similar order. Our approach allows both dense and sparse integration of user clicks, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency as compared to prior works. Experimental results demonstrate that OIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU after one click by 7.61 on the HQSeg44K dataset and 1.32 on the DAVIS dataset as compared to the previous state-of-the-art SegNext, while also doubling inference speed compared to current leading methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaonan Jing, Srinivas Billa, Danny Godbout</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination has been a popular topic in natural language generation (NLG). In real-world applications, unfaithful content can result in bad data quality or loss of trust from end users. Thus, it is crucial to fact-check before adopting NLG for production usage, which can be expensive if done manually. In this paper, we investigate automated faithfulness evaluation in guided NLG. We developed a rubrics template and use large language models (LLMs) to score the generation into quantifiable scales. We compared popular LLMs as well as the widely adopted natural language inference (NLI) models in scoring quality and sensitivity. In addition, we developed methods to generation synthetic unfaithful data, as well as a heuristics to quantify the percentage of hallucination. Our results on 4 travel-domain industry dataset show that GPT-4 can provide accurate judgement and explanation on whether a source and a generation are factually consistent. Furthermore, we found that tuning NLI models on synthetic data can improve performance. Lastly, we present insights on latency and cost for deploying such system.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyi Ma, Xiaohan Li, Zezhong Fan, Jianpeng Xu, Jason Cho, Praveen Kanumala, Kaushiki Nag, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing the performance of personalized recommendation systems. Traditional models, which often rely on singular data sources, lack the depth needed to accurately capture the multifaceted nature of item features and user behaviors. This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-behavior recommendations, leveraging the fusion of triple-modality, which is visual, textual, and graph data through alignment with large language models (LLMs). By incorporating visual information, we capture contextual and aesthetic item characteristics; textual data provides insights into user interests and item features in detail; and graph data elucidates relationships within the item-behavior heterogeneous graphs. Our proposed model called Triple Modality Fusion (TMF) utilizes the power of LLMs to align and integrate these three modalities, achieving a comprehensive representation of user behaviors. The LLM models the user's interactions including behaviors and item features in natural languages. Initially, the LLM is warmed up using only natural language-based prompts. We then devise the modality fusion module based on cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms to integrate different modalities from other models into the same embedding space and incorporate them into an LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving recommendation accuracy. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of the TMF.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12229">Comprehending Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models for Recommender Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqiang Cui, Yunpeng Weng, Xing Tang, Fuyuan Lyu, Dugang Liu, Xiuqiang He, Chen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, the introduction of knowledge graphs (KGs) has significantly advanced recommender systems by facilitating the discovery of potential associations between items. However, existing methods still face several limitations. First, most KGs suffer from missing facts or limited scopes. This can lead to biased knowledge representations, thereby constraining the model's performance. Second, existing methods typically convert textual information into IDs, resulting in the loss of natural semantic connections between different items. Third, existing methods struggle to capture high-order relationships in global KGs due to their inefficient layer-by-layer information propagation mechanisms, which are prone to introducing significant noise. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called CoLaKG, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for knowledge-aware recommendation. The extensive world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities of LLMs enable them to supplement KGs. Additionally, the strong text comprehension abilities of LLMs allow for a better understanding of semantic information. Based on this, we first extract subgraphs centered on each item from the KG and convert them into textual inputs for the LLM. The LLM then outputs its comprehension of these item-centered subgraphs, which are subsequently transformed into semantic embeddings. Furthermore, to utilize the global information of the KG, we construct an item-item graph using these semantic embeddings, which can directly capture higher-order associations between items. Both the semantic embeddings and the structural information from the item-item graph are effectively integrated into the recommendation model through our designed representation alignment and neighbor augmentation modules. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wen Zheng Terence Ng, Jianda Chen, Sinno Jialin Pan, Tianwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying a safe mobile robot policy in scenarios with human pedestrians is challenging due to their unpredictable movements. Current Reinforcement Learning-based motion planners rely on a single policy to simulate pedestrian movements and could suffer from the over-fitting issue. Alternatively, framing the collision avoidance problem as a multi-agent framework, where agents generate dynamic movements while learning to reach their goals, can lead to conflicts with human pedestrians due to their homogeneity.
  To tackle this problem, we introduce an efficient method that enhances agent diversity within a single policy by maximizing an information-theoretic objective. This diversity enriches each agent's experiences, improving its adaptability to unseen crowd behaviors. In assessing an agent's robustness against unseen crowds, we propose diverse scenarios inspired by pedestrian crowd behaviors. Our behavior-conditioned policies outperform existing works in these challenging scenes, reducing potential collisions without additional time or travel.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Chen, Kaiyan Zhao, Yiming Wang, Ming Yang, Jian Zhang, Xiaoguang Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Nowadays transformer-based Large Language Models (LLM) for code generation tasks usually apply sampling and filtering pipelines. Due to the sparse reward problem in code generation tasks caused by one-token incorrectness, transformer-based models will sample redundant programs till they find a correct one, leading to low efficiency. To overcome the challenge, we incorporate Experience Replay (ER) in the fine-tuning phase, where codes and programs produced are stored and will be replayed to give the LLM agent a chance to learn from past experiences. Based on the spirit of ER, we introduce a novel approach called BTP pipeline which consists of three phases: beam search sampling, testing phase, and prioritized experience replay phase. The approach makes use of failed programs collected by code models and replays programs with high Possibility and Pass-rate Prioritized value (P2Value) from the replay buffer to improve efficiency. P2Value comprehensively considers the possibility of transformers' output and pass rate and can make use of the redundant resources caused by the problem that most programs collected by LLMs fail to pass any tests. We empirically apply our approach in several LLMs, demonstrating that it enhances their performance in code generation tasks and surpasses existing baselines.</p>

DAP uses a single policy to predict two sets of actions: one for maximizing task rewards in simulation and another specifically for domain adaptation via reward adjustments. This decoupling makes it easier to maximize the overall reward in the source domain during training. Additionally, DAP incorporates uncertainty-based exploration during training to enhance agent robustness. Experimental results demonstrate DAP's effectiveness in bridging the sim-to-real gap, outperforming baselines on challenging tasks in simulation, and further improvement is achieved by incorporating uncertainty estimation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We conduct the convergence analysis of parameter estimation in the contaminated mixture of experts. This model is motivated from the prompt learning problem where ones utilize prompts, which can be formulated as experts, to fine-tune a large-scaled pre-trained model for learning downstream tasks. There are two fundamental challenges emerging from the analysis: (i) the proportion in the mixture of the pre-trained model and the prompt may converge to zero where the prompt vanishes during the training; (ii) the algebraic interaction among parameters of the pre-trained model and the prompt can occur via some partial differential equation and decelerate the prompt learning. In response, we introduce a distinguishability condition to control the previous parameter interaction. Additionally, we also consider various types of expert structures to understand their effects on the parameter estimation. In each scenario, we provide comprehensive convergence rates of parameter estimation along with the corresponding minimax lower bounds.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning nomral patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising resutls, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim Hunter</p>
<p>Abstract: A central goal of linguistic theory is to find a precise characterization of the notion "possible human language", in the form of a computational device that is capable of describing all and only the languages that can be acquired by a typically developing human child. The success of recent large language models (LLMs) in NLP applications arguably raises the possibility that LLMs might be computational devices that meet this goal. This would only be the case if, in addition to succeeding in learning human languages, LLMs struggle to learn "impossible" human languages. Kallini et al. (2024; "Mission: Impossible Language Models", Proc. ACL) conducted experiments aiming to test this by training GPT-2 on a variety of synthetic languages, and found that it learns some more successfully than others. They present these asymmetries as support for the idea that LLMs' inductive biases align with what is regarded as "possible" for human languages, but the most significant comparison has a confound that makes this conclusion unwarranted. In this paper I explain the confound and suggest some ways forward towards constructing a comparison that appropriately tests the underlying issue.</p>

Our approach features a two-step generation-selection pipeline, using hallucination pattern guidance and a language style alignment during generation. Hallucination pattern guidance leverages the most important task-specific hallucination patterns while language style alignment aligns the style of the synthetic dataset with benchmark text. To obtain robust supervised detectors from synthetic datasets, we also adopt a data mixture strategy to improve performance robustness and generalization. Our results on three datasets show that our generated hallucination text is more closely aligned with non-hallucinated text versus baselines, to train hallucination detectors with better generalization. Our hallucination detectors trained on synthetic datasets outperform in-context-learning (ICL)-based detectors by a large margin of 32%. Our extensive experiments confirm the benefits of our approach with cross-task and cross-generator generalization. Our data-mixture-based training further improves the generalization and robustness of hallucination detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Synthetically generated speech has rapidly approached human levels of naturalness. However, the paradox remains that ASR systems, when trained on TTS output that is judged as natural by humans, continue to perform badly on real speech. In this work, we explore whether this phenomenon is due to the oversmoothing behaviour of models commonly used in TTS, with a particular focus on the behaviour of TTS-for-ASR as the amount of TTS training data is scaled up. We systematically compare Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to Mean Squared Error (MSE) based models for TTS, when used for ASR model training. We test the scalability of the two approaches, varying both the number hours, and the number of different speakers. We find that for a given model size, DDPM can make better use of more data, and a more diverse set of speakers, than MSE models. We achieve the best reported ratio between real and synthetic speech WER to date (1.46), but also find that a large gap remains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linwei Tao, Haolan Guo, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Calibration is crucial in deep learning applications, especially in fields like healthcare and autonomous driving, where accurate confidence estimates are vital for decision-making. However, deep neural networks often suffer from miscalibration, with reliability diagrams and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) being the only standard perspective for evaluating calibration performance. In this paper, we introduce the concept of consistency as an alternative perspective on model calibration, inspired by uncertainty estimation literature in large language models (LLMs). We highlight its advantages over the traditional reliability-based view. Building on this concept, we propose a post-hoc calibration method called Consistency Calibration (CC), which adjusts confidence based on the model's consistency across perturbed inputs. CC is particularly effective in locally uncertainty estimation, as it requires no additional data samples or label information, instead generating input perturbations directly from the source data. Moreover, we show that performing perturbations at the logit level significantly improves computational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of CC through extensive comparisons with various post-hoc and training-time calibration methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, as well as on long-tailed datasets like ImageNet-LT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Sun, Xinchen Wang, Youdi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess impressive reasoning abilities but are prone to generating incorrect information, often referred to as hallucinations. While incorporating external Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can partially mitigate this issue, existing methods primarily treat KGs as static knowledge repositories, overlooking the critical disparity between KG and LLM knowledge, and failing to fully exploit the reasoning capabilities inherent in KGs. To address these limitations, we propose Pyramid-Driven Alignment (PDA), a novel framework for seamlessly integrating LLMs with KGs. PDA utilizes Pyramid Principle analysis to construct a hierarchical pyramid structure. This structure is designed to reflect the input question and generate more validated deductive knowledge, thereby enhancing the alignment of LLMs and KGs and ensuring more cohesive integration. Furthermore, PDA employs a recursive mechanism to harness the underlying reasoning abilities of KGs, resulting in more accurate knowledge retrieval for question-answering tasks. Our experimental results reveal a substantial performance advantage of PDA over state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements reaching 26.70% and 26.78%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Cao, Tong Wu, Zhiyong Chen, Yin Xu, Meixia Tao, Wenjun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task, multi-link relay semantic communications (MTML-RSC) scheme that enables the destination node to simultaneously perform image reconstruction and classification with one transmission from the source node. In the MTML-RSC scheme, the source node broadcasts a signal using semantic communications, and the relay node forwards the signal to the destination. We analyze the coupling relationship between the two tasks and the two links (source-to-relay and source-to-destination) and design a semantic-focused forward method for the relay node, where it selectively forwards only the semantics of the relevant class while ignoring others. At the destination, the node combines signals from both the source node and the relay node to perform classification, and then uses the classification result to assist in decoding the signal from the relay node for image reconstructing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MTML-RSC scheme achieves significant performance gains, e.g., $1.73$ dB improvement in peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for image reconstruction and increasing the accuracy from $64.89\%$ to $70.31\%$ for classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open domain question answering systems frequently rely on information retrieved from large collections of text (such as the Web) to answer questions. However, such collections of text often contain conflicting information, and indiscriminately depending on this information may result in untruthful and inaccurate answers. To understand the gravity of this problem, we collect a human-annotated dataset, Question Answering with Conflicting Contexts (QACC), and find that as much as 25% of unambiguous, open domain questions can lead to conflicting contexts when retrieved using Google Search. We evaluate and benchmark three powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with our dataset QACC and demonstrate their limitations in effectively addressing questions with conflicting information. To explore how humans reason through conflicting contexts, we request our annotators to provide explanations for their selections of correct answers. We demonstrate that by finetuning LLMs to explain their answers, we can introduce richer information into their training that guide them through the process of reasoning with conflicting contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Yu, Haoyu Xie, Lei Shang, Yang Liu, Jun Dan, Baigui Sun, Liefeng Bo</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of human-centric personalized image generation, the adapter-based method obtains the ability to customize and generate portraits by text-to-image training on facial data. This allows for identity-preserved personalization without additional fine-tuning in inference. Although there are improvements in efficiency and fidelity, there is often a significant performance decrease in test following ability, controllability, and diversity of generated faces compared to the base model. In this paper, we analyze that the performance degradation is attributed to the failure to decouple identity features from other attributes during extraction, as well as the failure to decouple the portrait generation training from the overall generation task. To address these issues, we propose the Face Adapter with deCoupled Training (FACT) framework, focusing on both model architecture and training strategy. To decouple identity features from others, we leverage a transformer-based face-export encoder and harness fine-grained identity features. To decouple the portrait generation training, we propose Face Adapting Increment Regularization~(FAIR), which effectively constrains the effect of face adapters on the facial region, preserving the generative ability of the base model. Additionally, we incorporate a face condition drop and shuffle mechanism, combined with curriculum learning, to enhance facial controllability and diversity. As a result, FACT solely learns identity preservation from training data, thereby minimizing the impact on the original text-to-image capabilities of the base model. Extensive experiments show that FACT has both controllability and fidelity in both text-to-image generation and inpainting solutions for portrait generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Cai, Jiahao Yu, Yangguang Shao, Yuhang Wu, Xinyu Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Fingerprinting large language models (LLMs) is essential for verifying model ownership, ensuring authenticity, and preventing misuse. Traditional fingerprinting methods often require significant computational overhead or white-box verification access. In this paper, we introduce UTF, a novel and efficient approach to fingerprinting LLMs by leveraging under-trained tokens. Under-trained tokens are tokens that the model has not fully learned during its training phase. By utilizing these tokens, we perform supervised fine-tuning to embed specific input-output pairs into the model. This process allows the LLM to produce predetermined outputs when presented with certain inputs, effectively embedding a unique fingerprint. Our method has minimal overhead and impact on model's performance, and does not require white-box access to target model's ownership identification. Compared to existing fingerprinting methods, UTF is also more effective and robust to fine-tuning and random guess.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Yuan, Dehui Du, Hao Zhang, Zixiang Di, Usman Naseem</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in reasoning tasks but face limitations in mathematical and complex logical reasoning. Existing methods to improve LLMs' logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a novel framework aimed at enhancing the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Through reverse reasoning, we ultilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botian Jiang, Lei Li, Xiaonan Li, Zhaowei Li, Xiachong Feng, Lingpeng Kong, Qi Liu, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has been accompanied by the development of various benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, the true nature of these evaluations and the extent to which they assess multimodal reasoning versus merely leveraging the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) backbone remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the role of LLM backbones in MLLM evaluation, focusing on two critical aspects: the degree to which current benchmarks truly assess multimodal reasoning and the influence of LLM prior knowledge on performance. Specifically, we introduce a modified evaluation protocol to disentangle the contributions of the LLM backbone from multimodal integration, and an automatic knowledge identification technique for diagnosing whether LLMs equip the necessary knowledge for corresponding multimodal questions. Our study encompasses four diverse MLLM benchmarks and eight state-of-the-art MLLMs. Key findings reveal that some benchmarks allow high performance even without visual inputs and up to 50\% of error rates can be attributed to insufficient world knowledge in the LLM backbone, indicating a heavy reliance on language capabilities. To address knowledge deficiencies, we propose a knowledge augmentation pipeline that achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to 60\% on certain datasets, resulting in a approximately 4x increase in performance. Our work provides crucial insights into the role of the LLM backbone in MLLMs, and highlights the need for more nuanced benchmarking approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Gambetta, Gizem Gezici, Fosca Giannotti, Dino Pedreschi, Alistair Knott, Luca Pappalardo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has focused on the medium and long-term impacts of generative AI, posing scientific and societal challenges mainly due to the detection and reliability of machine-generated information, which is projected to form the major content on the Web soon. Prior studies show that LLMs exhibit a lower performance in generation tasks (model collapse) as they undergo a fine-tuning process across multiple generations on their own generated content (self-consuming loop). In this paper, we present a comprehensive simulation framework built upon the chat version of LLama2, focusing particularly on the linguistic aspects of the generated content, which has not been fully examined in existing studies. Our results show that the model produces less lexical rich content across generations, reducing diversity. The lexical richness has been measured using the linguistic measures of entropy and TTR as well as calculating the POSTags frequency. The generated content has also been examined with an $n$-gram analysis, which takes into account the word order, and semantic networks, which consider the relation between different words. These findings suggest that the model collapse occurs not only by decreasing the content diversity but also by distorting the underlying linguistic patterns of the generated text, which both highlight the critical importance of carefully choosing and curating the initial input text, which can alleviate the model collapse problem. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the fine-tuned models of the pipeline to compare their performances on generic NLP tasks to the original model. We find that autophagy transforms the initial model into a more creative, doubtful and confused one, which might provide inaccurate answers and include conspiracy theories in the model responses, spreading false and biased information on the Web.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guopeng Li, Qiang Wang, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding, Yuan Gao, Gui-Song Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Most knowledge distillation (KD) methodologies predominantly focus on teacher-student pairs with similar architectures, such as both being convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the potential and flexibility of KD can be greatly improved by expanding it to novel Cross-Architecture KD (CAKD), where the knowledge of homogeneous and heterogeneous teachers can be transferred flexibly to a given student. The primary challenge in CAKD lies in the substantial feature gaps between heterogeneous models, originating from the distinction of their inherent inductive biases and module functions. To this end, we introduce an assistant model as a bridge to facilitate smooth feature knowledge transfer between heterogeneous teachers and students. More importantly, within our proposed design principle, the assistant model combines the advantages of cross-architecture inductive biases and module functions by merging convolution and attention modules derived from both student and teacher module functions. Furthermore, we observe that heterogeneous features exhibit diverse spatial distributions in CAKD, hindering the effectiveness of conventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. Therefore, we leverage a spatial-agnostic InfoNCE loss to align features after spatial smoothing, thereby improving the feature alignments in CAKD. Our proposed method is evaluated across some homogeneous model pairs and arbitrary heterogeneous combinations of CNNs, ViTs, and MLPs, achieving state-of-the-art performance for distilled models with a maximum gain of 11.47% on CIFAR-100 and 3.67% on ImageNet-1K. Our code and models will be released.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Gebe\c{s}\c{c}e, G\"ozde G\"ul \c{S}ahin</p>
<p>Abstract: Sophisticated grammatical error detection/correction tools are available for a small set of languages such as English and Chinese. However, it is not straightforward -- if not impossible -- to adapt them to morphologically rich languages with complex writing rules like Turkish which has more than 80 million speakers. Even though several tools exist for Turkish, they primarily focus on spelling errors rather than grammatical errors and lack features such as web interfaces, error explanations and feedback mechanisms. To fill this gap, we introduce GECTurk WEB, a light, open-source, and flexible web-based system that can detect and correct the most common forms of Turkish writing errors, such as the misuse of diacritics, compound and foreign words, pronouns, light verbs along with spelling mistakes. Our system provides native speakers and second language learners an easily accessible tool to detect/correct such mistakes and also to learn from their mistakes by showing the explanation for the violated rule(s). The proposed system achieves 88,3 system usability score, and is shown to help learn/remember a grammatical rule (confirmed by 80% of the participants). The GECTurk WEB is available both as an offline tool at https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/gecturkweb or online at www.gecturk.net.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingren Yao, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Renhe Jiang, Yuxuan Liang, Ming Jin, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fengji Zhang, Linquan Wu, Huiyu Bai, Guancheng Lin, Xiao Li, Xiao Yu, Yue Wang, Bei Chen, Jacky Keung</p>
<p>Abstract: Coding tasks have been valuable for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), as they demand the comprehension of high-level instructions, complex reasoning, and the implementation of functional programs -- core capabilities for advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which extend LLMs with visual perception and understanding capabilities, there remains a notable lack of coding benchmarks that rigorously assess these models, particularly in tasks that emphasize visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce HumanEval-V, a novel and lightweight benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' visual understanding and reasoning capabilities through code generation. HumanEval-V includes 108 carefully crafted, entry-level Python coding tasks derived from platforms like CodeForces and Stack Overflow. Each task is adapted by modifying the context and algorithmic patterns of the original problems, with visual elements redrawn to ensure distinction from the source, preventing potential data leakage. LMMs are required to complete the code solution based on the provided visual context and a predefined Python function signature outlining the task requirements. Every task is equipped with meticulously handcrafted test cases to ensure a thorough and reliable evaluation of model-generated solutions. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LMMs using HumanEval-V, uncovering significant challenges. Proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve only 13% pass@1 and 36.4% pass@10, while open-weight models with 70B parameters score below 4% pass@1. Ablation studies further reveal the limitations of current LMMs in vision reasoning and coding capabilities. These results underscore key areas for future research to enhance LMMs' capabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonghwan Hyeon, Yung-Hwan Oh, Ho-Jin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) analyzes human emotions expressed through speech. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising approach to SER by learning meaningful representations from a large amount of unlabeled audio data. However, existing SSL-based methods rely on Global Average Pooling (GAP) to represent audio signals, treating speech and non-speech segments equally. This can lead to dilution of informative speech features by irrelevant non-speech information. To address this, the paper proposes Segmental Average Pooling (SAP), which selectively focuses on informative speech segments while ignoring non-speech segments. By applying both GAP and SAP to SSL features, our approach utilizes overall speech signal information from GAP and specific information from SAP, leading to improved SER performance. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP for English and superior performance on KEMDy19 for Korean datasets in both unweighted and weighted accuracies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luigi Bellomarini, Costanza Catalano, Andrea Coletta, Michela Iezzi, Pierangela Samarati</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have recently gained relevant attention in many application domains, from healthcare to biotechnology, from logistics to finance. Financial organisations, central banks, economic research entities, and national supervision authorities apply ontological reasoning on KGs to address crucial business tasks, such as economic policymaking, banking supervision, anti-money laundering, and economic research. Reasoning allows for the generation of derived knowledge capturing complex business semantics and the set up of effective business processes. A major obstacle in KGs sharing is represented by privacy considerations since the identity of the data subjects and their sensitive or company-confidential information may be improperly exposed.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework to enable KGs sharing while ensuring that information that should remain private is not directly released nor indirectly exposed via derived knowledge, while maintaining the embedded knowledge of the KGs to support business downstream tasks. Our approach produces a privacy-preserving synthetic KG as an augmentation of the input one via the introduction of structural anonymisation. We introduce a novel privacy measure for KGs, which considers derived knowledge and a new utility metric that captures the business semantics we want to preserve, and propose two novel anonymization algorithms. Our extensive experimental evaluation, with both synthetic graphs and real-world datasets, confirms the effectiveness of our approach achieving up to a 70% improvement in the privacy of entities compared to existing methods not specifically designed for KGs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The conformity effect describes the tendency of individuals to align their responses with the majority. Studying this bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, as LLMs are increasingly used in various information-seeking and decision-making tasks as conversation partners to improve productivity. Thus, conformity to incorrect responses can compromise their effectiveness. In this paper, we adapt psychological experiments to examine the extent of conformity in state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal that all models tested exhibit varying levels of conformity toward the majority, regardless of their initial choice or correctness, across different knowledge domains. Notably, we are the first to show that LLMs are more likely to conform when they are more uncertain in their own prediction. We further explore factors that influence conformity, such as training paradigms and input characteristics, finding that instruction-tuned models are less susceptible to conformity, while increasing the naturalness of majority tones amplifies conformity. Finally, we propose two interventions--Devil's Advocate and Question Distillation--to mitigate conformity, providing insights into building more robust language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchao Pang, Zhigang Lu, Haichen Wang, Peng Fu, Yongbin Zhou, Minhui Xue, Bo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto privacy standard against privacy leakage attacks, including many recently discovered ones against large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that LLMs could reconstruct the altered/removed privacy from given DP-sanitized prompts. We propose two attacks (black-box and white-box) based on the accessibility to LLMs and show that LLMs could connect the pair of DP-sanitized text and the corresponding private training data of LLMs by giving sample text pairs as instructions (in the black-box attacks) or fine-tuning data (in the white-box attacks). To illustrate our findings, we conduct comprehensive experiments on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3, Claude-3.5, OPT, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, Gemma-2, and Pythia) using commonly used datasets (such as WikiMIA, Pile-CC, and Pile-Wiki) against both word-level and sentence-level DP. The experimental results show promising recovery rates, e.g., the black-box attacks against the word-level DP over WikiMIA dataset gave 72.18% on LLaMA-2 (70B), 82.39% on LLaMA-3 (70B), 75.35% on Gemma-2, 91.2% on ChatGPT-4o, and 94.01% on Claude-3.5 (Sonnet). More urgently, this study indicates that these well-known LLMs have emerged as a new security risk for existing DP text sanitization approaches in the current environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Black-box optimization algorithms have been widely used in various machine learning problems, including reinforcement learning and prompt fine-tuning. However, directly optimizing the training loss value, as commonly done in existing black-box optimization methods, could lead to suboptimal model quality and generalization performance. To address those problems in black-box optimization, we propose a novel Sharpness-Aware Black-box Optimization (SABO) algorithm, which applies a sharpness-aware minimization strategy to improve the model generalization. Specifically, the proposed SABO method first reparameterizes the objective function by its expectation over a Gaussian distribution. Then it iteratively updates the parameterized distribution by approximated stochastic gradients of the maximum objective value within a small neighborhood around the current solution in the Gaussian distribution space. Theoretically, we prove the convergence rate and generalization bound of the proposed SABO algorithm. Empirically, extensive experiments on the black-box prompt fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SABO method in improving model generalization performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, AI-based software engineering has progressed from pre-trained models to advanced agentic workflows, with Software Development Agents representing the next major leap. These agents, capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with external environments, offer promising solutions to complex software engineering tasks. However, while much research has evaluated code generated by large language models (LLMs), comprehensive studies on agent-generated patches, particularly in real-world settings, are lacking. This study addresses that gap by evaluating 4,892 patches from 10 top-ranked agents on 500 real-world GitHub issues from SWE-Bench Verified, focusing on their impact on code quality. Our analysis shows no single agent dominated, with 170 issues unresolved, indicating room for improvement. Even for patches that passed unit tests and resolved issues, agents made different file and function modifications compared to the gold patches from repository developers, revealing limitations in the benchmark's test case coverage. Most agents maintained code reliability and security, avoiding new bugs or vulnerabilities; while some agents increased code complexity, many reduced code duplication and minimized code smells. Finally, agents performed better on simpler codebases, suggesting that breaking complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks could improve effectiveness. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of agent-generated patches on real-world GitHub issues, offering insights to advance AI-driven software development.</p>

<p>Abstract: Crude oil, a critical component of the global economy, has its prices influenced by various factors such as economic trends, political events, and natural disasters. Traditional prediction methods based on historical data have their limits in forecasting, but recent advancements in natural language processing bring new possibilities for event-based analysis. In particular, Language Models (LM) and their advancement, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), have shown potential in classifying vast amounts of natural language. However, these LMs often have difficulty with domain-specific terminology, limiting their effectiveness in the crude oil sector. Addressing this gap, we introduce CrudeBERT, a fine-tuned LM specifically for the crude oil market. The results indicate that CrudeBERT's sentiment scores align more closely with the WTI Futures curve and significantly enhance price predictions, underscoring the crucial role of integrating economic principles into LMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqin Xu, Huan Li, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou</p>
<p>Abstract: Schema and entity matching tasks are crucial for data integration and management. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in these tasks, they suffer from hallucinations and confusion about task instructions. In this paper, we present the Knowledge-Compliant Matching Framework (KcMF), an LLM-based approach that addresses these issues without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. KcMF employs a pseudo-code-based task decomposition strategy to adopt task-specific natural language statements that guide LLM reasoning and reduce confusion. We also propose two mechanisms, Dataset as Knowledge (DaK) and Example as Knowledge (EaK), to build domain knowledge sets when unstructured domain knowledge is lacking. Additionally, we introduce a result-ensembling strategy to leverage multiple knowledge sources and suppress poorly formatted outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on schema and entity matching tasks demonstrate that KcMF outperforms previous non-LLM state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average F1 score of 22.9% and competes effectively with SOTA fine-tuned LLMs. Moreover, KcMF generalizes well across different LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Loris Gaven, Clement Romac, Thomas Carta, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</p>
<p>Abstract: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philippe Nadeau, Jonathan Kelly</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a planner designed to guide robot manipulators in stably placing objects within intricate scenes. Our proposed method reverses the traditional approach to object placement: our planner selects contact points first and then determines a placement pose that solicits the selected points. This is instead of sampling poses, identifying contact points, and evaluating pose quality. Our algorithm facilitates stability-aware object placement planning, imposing no restrictions on object shape, convexity, or mass density homogeneity, while avoiding combinatorial computational complexity. Our proposed stability heuristic enables our planner to find a solution about 20 times faster when compared to the same algorithm not making use of the heuristic and eight times faster than a state-of-the-art method that uses the traditional sample-and-evaluate approach. Our proposed planner is also more successful in finding stable placements than the five other benchmarked algorithms. Derived from first principles and validated in ten real robot experiments, our planner offers a general and scalable method to tackle the problem of object placement planning with rigid objects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Zhu, Bocheng Li, Hang Zhang, Xin Li, Linli Xu, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Latent-based image generative models, such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and Mask Image Models (MIMs), have achieved notable success in image generation tasks. These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiabao Wei, Zhiyuan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) aims to synthesis specific person images dressed in given garments, which recently receives numerous attention in online shopping scenarios. Currently, the core challenges of the VTON task mainly lie in the fine-grained semantic extraction (i.e.,deep semantics) of the given reference garments during depth estimation and effective texture preservation when the garments are synthesized and warped onto human body. To cope with these issues, we propose DH-VTON, a deep text-driven virtual try-on model featuring a special hybrid attention learning strategy and deep garment semantic preservation module. By standing on the shoulder of a well-built pre-trained paint-by-example (abbr. PBE) approach, we present our DH-VTON pipeline in this work. Specifically, to extract the deep semantics of the garments, we first introduce InternViT-6B as fine-grained feature learner, which can be trained to align with the large-scale intrinsic knowledge with deep text semantics (e.g.,"neckline" or "girdle") to make up for the deficiency of the commonly adopted CLIP encoder. Based on this, to enhance the customized dressing abilities, we further introduce Garment-Feature ControlNet Plus (abbr. GFC+) module and propose to leverage a fresh hybrid attention strategy for training, which can adaptively integrate fine-grained characteristics of the garments into the different layers of the VTON model, so as to achieve multi-scale features preservation effects. Extensive experiments on several representative datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous diffusion-based and GAN-based approaches, showing competitive performance in preserving garment details and generating authentic human images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hudson M. S. Bruno, Esther L. Colombini, Sidney N. Givigi Jr</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) is a fundamental technology for robotics applications. While VSLAM research has achieved significant advancements, its robustness under challenging situations, such as poor lighting, dynamic environments, motion blur, and sensor failures, remains a challenging issue. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel RGB-D dataset designed for evaluating the robustness of VSLAM systems. The dataset comprises real-world indoor scenes with dynamic objects, motion blur, and varying illumination, as well as emulated camera failures, including lens dirt, condensation, underexposure, and overexposure. Additionally, we offer open-source scripts for injecting camera failures into any images, enabling further customization by the research community. Our experiments demonstrate that ORB-SLAM2, a traditional VSLAM algorithm, and TartanVO, a Deep Learning-based VO algorithm, can experience performance degradation under these challenging conditions. Therefore, this dataset and the camera failure open-source tools provide a valuable resource for developing more robust VSLAM systems capable of handling real-world challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riya Dinesh Deshpande, Faheem A. Khan, Qasim Zeeshan Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: As the number of devices getting connected to the vehicular network grows exponentially, addressing the numerous challenges of effectively allocating spectrum in dynamic vehicular environment becomes increasingly difficult. Traditional methods may not suffice to tackle this issue. In vehicular networks safety critical messages are involved and it is important to implement an efficient spectrum allocation paradigm for hassle free communication as well as manage the congestion in the network. To tackle this, a Deep Q Network (DQN) model is proposed as a solution, leveraging its ability to learn optimal strategies over time and make decisions. The paper presents a few results and analyses, demonstrating the efficacy of the DQN model in enhancing spectrum sharing efficiency. Deep Reinforcement Learning methods for sharing spectrum in vehicular networks have shown promising outcomes, demonstrating the system's ability to adjust to dynamic communication environments. Both SARL and MARL models have exhibited successful rates of V2V communication, with the cumulative reward of the RL model reaching its maximum as training progresses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cosimo Gregucci, Bo Xiong, Daniel Hernandez, Lorenzo Loconte, Pasquale Minervini, Steffen Staab, Antonio Vergari</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) on knowledge graphs (KGs) is gaining momentum as a challenging reasoning task. In this paper, we show that the current benchmarks for CQA are not really complex, and the way they are built distorts our perception of progress in this field. For example, we find that in these benchmarks, most queries (up to 98% for some query types) can be reduced to simpler problems, e.g., link prediction, where only one link needs to be predicted. The performance of state-of-the-art CQA models drops significantly when such models are evaluated on queries that cannot be reduced to easier types. Thus, we propose a set of more challenging benchmarks, composed of queries that require models to reason over multiple hops and better reflect the construction of real-world KGs. In a systematic empirical investigation, the new benchmarks show that current methods leave much to be desired from current CQA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Rahmani (Gavin),  Zhenlin (Gavin),  Xu, Simeon C. Calvert, Bart van Arem</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance road safety and efficiency. However, understanding the interactions between AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) at intersections remains an open research question. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining behavioral differences and adaptations of AVs and HVs at unsignalized intersections by utilizing two comprehensive AV datasets from Waymo and Lyft. Using a systematic methodology, the research identifies and analyzes merging and crossing conflicts by calculating key safety and efficiency metrics, including time to collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET), maximum required deceleration (MRD), time advantage (TA), and speed and acceleration profiles. The findings reveal a paradox in mixed traffic flow: while AVs maintain larger safety margins, their conservative behavior can lead to unexpected situations for human drivers, potentially causing unsafe conditions. From a performance point of view, human drivers exhibit more consistent behavior when interacting with AVs versus other HVs, suggesting AVs may contribute to harmonizing traffic flow patterns. Moreover, notable differences were observed between Waymo and Lyft vehicles, which highlights the importance of considering manufacturer-specific AV behaviors in traffic modeling and management strategies for the safe integration of AVs. The processed dataset utilized in this study is openly published to foster the research on AV-HV interactions.</p>

<p>Abstract: The remarkable understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved translation performance. However, incorrect understanding of the sentence to be translated can degrade translation quality. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Iterative Bilingual Understanding Translation (IBUT) method based on the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs and the dual characteristics of translation tasks. The cross-lingual capability of LLMs enables the generation of contextual understanding for both the source and target languages separately. Furthermore, the dual characteristics allow IBUT to generate effective cross-lingual feedback, iteratively refining contextual understanding, thereby reducing errors and improving translation performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed IBUT outperforms several strong comparison methods, especially being generalized to multiple domains (e.g., news, commonsense, and cultural translation benchmarks).</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of LLMs has significantly boosted the performance of complex long-form question answering tasks. However, one prominent issue of LLMs is the generated "hallucination" responses that are not factual. Consequently, attribution for each claim in responses becomes a common solution to improve the factuality and verifiability. Existing researches mainly focus on how to provide accurate citations for the response, which largely overlook the importance of identifying the claims or statements for each response. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new claim decomposition benchmark, which requires building system that can identify atomic and checkworthy claims for LLM responses. Specifically, we present the Chinese Atomic Claim Decomposition Dataset (CACDD), which builds on the WebCPM dataset with additional expert annotations to ensure high data quality. The CACDD encompasses a collection of 500 human-annotated question-answer pairs, including a total of 4956 atomic claims. We further propose a new pipeline for human annotation and describe the challenges of this task. In addition, we provide experiment results on zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuned LLMs as baselines. The results show that the claim decomposition is highly challenging and requires further explorations. All code and data are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/FBzzh/CACDD}.</p>

<p>Abstract: As we enter the era of big data, collecting high-quality data is very important. However, collecting data by humans is not only very time-consuming but also expensive. Therefore, many scientists have devised various methods to collect data using computers. Among them, there is a method called web crawling, but the authors found that the crawling method has a problem in that unintended data is collected along with the user. The authors found that this can be filtered using the object recognition model YOLOv10. However, there are cases where data that is not properly filtered remains. Here, image reclassification was performed by additionally utilizing the distance output from the Siamese network, and higher performance was recorded than other classification models. (average \_f1 score YOLO+MobileNet 0.678->YOLO+SiameseNet 0.772)) The user can specify a distance threshold to adjust the balance between data deficiency and noise-robustness. The authors also found that the Siamese network can achieve higher performance with fewer resources because the cropped images are used for object recognition when processing images in the Siamese network. (Class 20 mean-based f1 score, non-crop+Siamese(MobileNetV3-Small) 80.94 -> crop preprocessing+Siamese(MobileNetV3-Small) 82.31) In this way, the image retrieval system that utilizes two consecutive models to reduce errors can save users' time and effort, and build better quality data faster and with fewer resources than before.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems demonstrates strong common sense and reasoning abilities, effectively addressing the pitfalls of purely data-driven methods. Current LLM-based agents require lengthy inference times and face challenges in interacting with real-time autonomous driving environments. A key open question is whether we can effectively leverage the knowledge from LLMs to train an efficient and robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This paper introduces RAPID, a novel \underline{\textbf{R}}obust \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \underline{\textbf{P}}olicy \underline{\textbf{I}}nfusion and \underline{\textbf{D}}istillation framework, which trains specialized mix-of-policy RL agents using data synthesized by an LLM-based driving agent and online adaptation. RAPID features three key designs: 1) utilization of offline data collected from an LLM agent to distil expert knowledge into RL policies for faster real-time inference; 2) introduction of robust distillation in RL to inherit both performance and robustness from LLM-based teacher; and 3) employment of a mix-of-policy approach for joint decision decoding with a policy adapter. Through fine-tuning via online environment interaction, RAPID reduces the forgetting of LLM knowledge while maintaining adaptability to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate RAPID's capability to effectively integrate LLM knowledge into scaled-down RL policies in an efficient, adaptable, and robust way. Code and checkpoints will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Countless decisions shape our daily lives, and it is paramount to understand the how and why behind these choices. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM decision-making framework called STRUX, which enhances LLM decision-making by providing structured explanations. These include favorable and adverse facts related to the decision, along with their respective strengths. STRUX begins by distilling lengthy information into a concise table of key facts. It then employs a series of self-reflection steps to determine which of these facts are pivotal, categorizing them as either favorable or adverse in relation to a specific decision. Lastly, we fine-tune an LLM to identify and prioritize these key facts to optimize decision-making. STRUX has been evaluated on the challenging task of forecasting stock investment decisions based on earnings call transcripts and demonstrated superior performance against strong baselines. It enhances decision transparency by allowing users to understand the impact of different factors, representing a meaningful step towards practical decision-making with LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bartlomiej Sobieski, Jakub Grzywaczewski, Bartlomiej Sadlej, Matthew Tivnan, Przemyslaw Biecek</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs) have recently gained immense popularity as a tool for clarifying the decision-making process of image classifiers. This trend is largely motivated by what these explanations promise to deliver -- indicate semantically meaningful factors that change the classifier's decision. However, we argue that current state-of-the-art approaches lack a crucial component -- the region constraint -- whose absence prevents from drawing explicit conclusions, and may even lead to faulty reasoning due to phenomenons like confirmation bias. To address the issue of previous methods, which modify images in a very entangled and widely dispersed manner, we propose region-constrained VCEs (RVCEs), which assume that only a predefined image region can be modified to influence the model's prediction. To effectively sample from this subclass of VCEs, we propose Region-Constrained Counterfactual Schr\"odinger Bridges (RCSB), an adaptation of a tractable subclass of Schr\"odinger Bridges to the problem of conditional inpainting, where the conditioning signal originates from the classifier of interest. In addition to setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, we extend RCSB to allow for exact counterfactual reasoning, where the predefined region contains only the factor of interest, and incorporating the user to actively interact with the RVCE by predefining the regions manually.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Chen, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of sensing devices leads to a surge in data for spatio-temporal forecasting applications such as traffic flow, air quality, and wind energy. Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p>

To address these challenges, we introduce TimeDRL, a framework for multivariate time-series representation learning with dual-level disentangled embeddings. TimeDRL features: (i) disentangled timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for representation learning; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases. Experiments on forecasting and classification datasets show TimeDRL outperforms existing methods, with further validation in semi-supervised settings with limited labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dayana Savostianova, Emanuele Zangrando, Francesco Tudisco</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks on deep neural network models have seen rapid development and are extensively used to study the stability of these networks. Among various adversarial strategies, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a widely adopted method in computer vision due to its effectiveness and quick implementation, making it suitable for adversarial training. In this work, we observe that in many cases, the perturbations computed using PGD predominantly affect only a portion of the singular value spectrum of the original image, suggesting that these perturbations are approximately low-rank. Motivated by this observation, we propose a variation of PGD that efficiently computes a low-rank attack. We extensively validate our method on a range of standard models as well as robust models that have undergone adversarial training. Our analysis indicates that the proposed low-rank PGD can be effectively used in adversarial training due to its straightforward and fast implementation coupled with competitive performance. Notably, we find that low-rank PGD often performs comparably to, and sometimes even outperforms, the traditional full-rank PGD attack, while using significantly less memory.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the success of artificial general intelligence, there is a trend towards developing Graph Foundation Models that excel in generalization across various graph tasks and domains. However, current models often require extensive training or fine-tuning to capture structural and semantic insights on new graphs, which limits their versatility. In this work, we explore graph foundation models from the perspective of zero-shot reasoning on Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our focus is on utilizing KGs as a unified topological structure to tackle diverse tasks, while addressing semantic isolation challenges in KG reasoning to effectively integrate diverse semantic and structural features. This brings us new methodological insights into KG reasoning, as well as high generalizability towards foundation models in practice. Methodologically, we introduce SCORE, a unified graph reasoning framework that effectively generalizes diverse graph tasks using zero-shot learning. At the core of SCORE is semantic conditional message passing, a technique designed to capture both structural and semantic invariances in graphs, with theoretical backing for its expressive power. Practically, we evaluate the zero-shot reasoning capability of SCORE using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance improvement over prior foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yedi Hu, Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging has become one of the key technologies for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, our understanding of the expected performance gains and principles when merging any two models remains limited. In this work, we introduce model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs, analogous to biological evolution. With comprehensive empirical analysis, we find that there is a certain relationship between model kinship and the performance gains after model merging, which can help guide our selection of candidate models. Inspired by this, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can yield better performance on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we discover that using model kinship as a criterion can assist us in continuously performing model merging, alleviating the degradation (local optima) in model evolution, whereas model kinship can serve as a guide to escape these traps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Marsilio, Davide Marzorati, Matteo Rossi, Andrea Moglia, Luca Mainardi, Alfonso Manzotti, Pietro Cerveri</p>
<p>Abstract: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition affecting bones and cartilage, often leading to osteophyte formation, bone density loss, and joint space narrowing. Treatment options to restore normal joint function vary depending on the severity of the condition. This work introduces an innovative deep-learning framework processing shoulder CT scans. It features the semantic segmentation of the proximal humerus and scapula, the 3D reconstruction of bone surfaces, the identification of the glenohumeral (GH) joint region, and the staging of three common osteoarthritic-related pathologies: osteophyte formation (OS), GH space reduction (JS), and humeroscapular alignment (HSA). The pipeline comprises two cascaded CNN architectures: 3D CEL-UNet for segmentation and 3D Arthro-Net for threefold classification. A retrospective dataset of 571 CT scans featuring patients with various degrees of GH osteoarthritic-related pathologies was used to train, validate, and test the pipeline. Root mean squared error and Hausdorff distance median values for 3D reconstruction were 0.22mm and 1.48mm for the humerus and 0.24mm and 1.48mm for the scapula, outperforming state-of-the-art architectures and making it potentially suitable for a PSI-based shoulder arthroplasty preoperative plan context. The classification accuracy for OS, JS, and HSA consistently reached around 90% across all three categories. The computational time for the inference pipeline was less than 15s, showcasing the framework's efficiency and compatibility with orthopedic radiology practice. The outcomes represent a promising advancement toward the medical translation of artificial intelligence tools. This progress aims to streamline the preoperative planning pipeline delivering high-quality bone surfaces and supporting surgeons in selecting the most suitable surgical approach according to the unique patient joint conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sai Shankar Narasimhan, Shubhankar Agarwal, Litu Rout, Sanjay Shakkottai, Sandeep P. Chinchali</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints (~100) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 10% and 42%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various natural language generation and understanding tasks. However, their linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Yunchang Zhu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language alignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) successfully enables LLMs to understand visual input. However, we find that existing vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety mechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic image. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation of where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative analysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the specific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of safety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in current methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input images compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety mechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language Alignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input vision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states space in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the safety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment for LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also maintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vishaal Krishnan, Sumit Sinha, L. Mahadevan</p>
<p>Abstract: Patterns arise spontaneously in a range of systems spanning the sciences, and their study typically focuses on mechanisms to understand their evolution in space-time. Increasingly, there has been a transition towards controlling these patterns in various functional settings, with implications for engineering. Here, we combine our knowledge of a general class of dynamical laws for pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems, and the power of stochastic optimal control approaches to present a framework that allows us to control patterns at multiple scales, which we dub the "Hamiltonian bridge". We use a mapping between stochastic many-body Lagrangian physics and deterministic Eulerian pattern forming PDEs to leverage our recent approach utilizing the Feynman-Kac-based adjoint path integral formulation for the control of interacting particles and generalize this to the active control of patterning fields. We demonstrate the applicability of our computational framework via numerical experiments on the control of phase separation with and without a conserved order parameter, self-assembly of fluid droplets, coupled reaction-diffusion equations and finally a phenomenological model for spatio-temporal tissue differentiation. We interpret our numerical experiments in terms of a theoretical understanding of how the underlying physics shapes the geometry of the pattern manifold, altering the transport paths of patterns and the nature of pattern interpolation. We finally conclude by showing how optimal control can be utilized to generate complex patterns via an iterative control protocol over pattern forming pdes which can be casted as gradient flows. All together, our study shows how we can systematically build in physical priors into a generative framework for pattern control in non-equilibrium systems across multiple length and time scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sameep Chattopadhyay, Pulkit Paliwal, Sai Shankar Narasimhan, Shubhankar Agarwal, Sandeep P. Chinchali</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partial-differential-equation (PDE)-constrained optimization is a well-worn technique for acquiring optimal parameters of systems governed by PDEs. However, this approach is limited to providing a single set of optimal parameters per optimization. Given a differentiable PDE solver, if the free parameters are reparameterized as the output of a neural network, that neural network can be trained to learn a map from a probability distribution to the distribution of optimal parameters. This proves useful in the case where there are many well performing local minima for the PDE. We apply this technique to train a neural network that generates optimal parameters that minimize laser-plasma instabilities relevant to laser fusion and show that the neural network generates many well performing and diverse minima.</p>

<p>Abstract: Anatomical landmarks are vital in medical imaging for navigation and anomaly detection. Modern large language models (LLMs), like Llama-2, offer promise for automating the mapping of these landmarks in free-text radiology reports to corresponding positions in image data. Recent studies propose LLMs may develop coherent representations of generative processes. Motivated by these insights, we investigated whether LLMs accurately represent the spatial positions of anatomical landmarks. Through experiments with Llama-2 models, we found that they can linearly represent anatomical landmarks in space with considerable robustness to different prompts. These results underscore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingqi Wang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie, Jia Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models trained on large-scale data have enabled the generation of indistinguishable human-level images, yet they often produce harmful content misaligned with human values, e.g., social bias, and offensive content. Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image, value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.</p>

<p>Abstract: To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a decentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using geo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices. Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.
  To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is a promising cost-effective downscaling methodology for producing high-resolution climate information from coarser counterparts. A particular application is downscaling regional reanalysis outputs (predictand) from the driving global counterparts (predictor). This study conducts an intercomparison of various SR downscaling methods focusing on temperature and using the CERRA reanalysis (5.5 km resolution, produced with a regional atmospheric model driven by ERA5) as example. The method proposed in this work is the Swin transformer and two alternative methods are used as benchmark (fully convolutional U-Net and convolutional and dense DeepESD) as well as the simple bicubic interpolation. We compare two approaches, the standard one using the full domain as input and a more scalable tiling approach, dividing the full domain into tiles that are used as input. The methods are trained to downscale CERRA surface temperature, based on temperature information from the driving ERA5; in addition, the tiling approach includes static orographic information. We show that the tiling approach, which requires spatial transferability, comes at the cost of a lower performance (although it outperforms some full-domain benchmarks), but provides an efficient scalable solution that allows SR reduction on a pan-European scale and is valuable for real-time applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its high-dimensional observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage latent disentanglement that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent developments in adversarial attacks on deep learning leave many mission-critical natural language processing (NLP) systems at risk of exploitation. To address the lack of computationally efficient adversarial defense methods, this paper reports a novel, universal technique that drastically improves the robustness of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) by combining the unitary weights with the multi-margin loss. We discover that the marriage of these two simple ideas amplifies the protection against malicious interference. Our model, the unitary multi-margin BERT (UniBERT), boosts post-attack classification accuracies significantly by 5.3% to 73.8% while maintaining competitive pre-attack accuracies. Furthermore, the pre-attack and post-attack accuracy tradeoff can be adjusted via a single scalar parameter to best fit the design requirements for the target applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehong Yoon, Shoubin Yu, Vaidehi Patil, Huaxiu Yao, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, but they have also increased the risk of producing unsafe content. Existing unlearning/editing-based methods for safe generation remove harmful concepts from models but face several challenges: (1) They cannot instantly remove harmful concepts without training. (2) Their safe generation capabilities depend on collected training data. (3) They alter model weights, risking degradation in quality for content unrelated to toxic concepts. To address these, we propose SAFREE, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I and T2V, that does not alter the model's weights. Specifically, we detect a subspace corresponding to a set of toxic concepts in the text embedding space and steer prompt embeddings away from this subspace, thereby filtering out harmful content while preserving intended semantics. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving safe concepts, SAFREE incorporates a novel self-validating filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the denoising steps when applying the filtered embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate adaptive re-attention mechanisms within the diffusion latent space to selectively diminish the influence of features related to toxic concepts at the pixel level. In the end, SAFREE ensures coherent safety checking, preserving the fidelity, quality, and safety of the output. SAFREE achieves SOTA performance in suppressing unsafe content in T2I generation compared to training-free baselines and effectively filters targeted concepts while maintaining high-quality images. It also shows competitive results against training-based methods. We extend SAFREE to various T2I backbones and T2V tasks, showcasing its flexibility and generalization. SAFREE provides a robust and adaptable safeguard for ensuring safe visual generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to discover new materials with desirable properties is critical for numerous applications from helping mitigate climate change to advances in next generation computing hardware. AI has the potential to accelerate materials discovery and design by more effectively exploring the chemical space compared to other computational methods or by trial-and-error. While substantial progress has been made on AI for materials data, benchmarks, and models, a barrier that has emerged is the lack of publicly available training data and open pre-trained models. To address this, we present a Meta FAIR release of the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) large-scale open dataset and an accompanying set of pre-trained models. OMat24 contains over 110 million density functional theory (DFT) calculations focused on structural and compositional diversity. Our EquiformerV2 models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Matbench Discovery leaderboard and are capable of predicting ground-state stability and formation energies to an F1 score above 0.9 and an accuracy of 20 meV/atom, respectively. We explore the impact of model size, auxiliary denoising objectives, and fine-tuning on performance across a range of datasets including OMat24, MPtraj, and Alexandria. The open release of the OMat24 dataset and models enables the research community to build upon our efforts and drive further advancements in AI-assisted materials science.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hunmin Lee, Hongju Seong, Wonbin Kim, Hyeokchan Kwon, Daehee Seo</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) serves a vital role in ensuring efficient and reliable communication services within distributed wireless networks. Recent developments have seen a surge in interest in deep neural network (DNN)-based AMC models, with Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising framework. Despite these advancements, the presence of various noises within the signal exerts significant challenges while optimizing models to capture salient features. Furthermore, existing FL-based AMC models commonly rely on linear aggregation strategies, which face notable difficulties in integrating locally fine-tuned parameters within practical non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) environments, thereby hindering optimal learning convergence. To address these challenges, we propose FedVaccine, a novel FL model aimed at improving generalizability across signals with varying noise levels by deliberately introducing a balanced level of noise. This is accomplished through our proposed harmonic noise resilience approach, which identifies an optimal noise tolerance for DNN models, thereby regulating the training process and mitigating overfitting. Additionally, FedVaccine overcomes the limitations of existing FL-based AMC models' linear aggregation by employing a split-learning strategy using structural clustering topology and local queue data structure, enabling adaptive and cumulative updates to local models. Our experimental results, including IID and non-IID datasets as well as ablation studies, confirm FedVaccine's robust performance and superiority over existing FL-based AMC approaches across different noise levels. These findings highlight FedVaccine's potential to enhance the reliability and performance of AMC systems in practical wireless network environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Jiang, Yuqi Xie, Jinhan Li, Ye Yuan, Yifeng Zhu, Yuke Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like embodiment, have the potential to integrate seamlessly into human environments. Critical to their coexistence and cooperation with humans is the ability to understand natural language communications and exhibit human-like behaviors. This work focuses on generating diverse whole-body motions for humanoid robots from language descriptions. We leverage human motion priors from extensive human motion datasets to initialize humanoid motions and employ the commonsense reasoning capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to edit and refine these motions. Our approach demonstrates the capability to produce natural, expressive, and text-aligned humanoid motions, validated through both simulated and real-world experiments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingya Li, Timothy Miller, Steven Bethard, Guergana Savova</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of multi-task learning can depend heavily on which tasks are grouped together. Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Rong, Tobias Leemann, Thai-trang Nguyen, Lisa Fiedler, Peizhu Qian, Vaibhav Unhelkar, Tina Seidel, Gjergji Kasneci, Enkelejda Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is widely viewed as a sine qua non for ever-expanding AI research. A better understanding of the needs of XAI users, as well as human-centered evaluations of explainable models are both a necessity and a challenge. In this paper, we explore how HCI and AI researchers conduct user studies in XAI applications based on a systematic literature review. After identifying and thoroughly analyzing 97core papers with human-based XAI evaluations over the past five years, we categorize them along the measured characteristics of explanatory methods, namely trust, understanding, usability, and human-AI collaboration performance. Our research shows that XAI is spreading more rapidly in certain application domains, such as recommender systems than in others, but that user evaluations are still rather sparse and incorporate hardly any insights from cognitive or social sciences. Based on a comprehensive discussion of best practices, i.e., common models, design choices, and measures in user studies, we propose practical guidelines on designing and conducting user studies for XAI researchers and practitioners. Lastly, this survey also highlights several open research directions, particularly linking psychological science and human-centered XAI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubin Xiao, Di Wang, Boyang Li, Huanhuan Chen, Wei Pang, Xuan Wu, Hao Li, Dong Xu, Yanchun Liang, You Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recently, neural networks have gained popularity in this research area because as shown in the literature, they provide strong heuristic solutions to TSPs. Compared to autoregressive neural approaches, non-autoregressive (NAR) networks exploit the inference parallelism to elevate inference speed but suffer from comparatively low solution quality. In this paper, we propose a novel NAR model named NAR4TSP, which incorporates a specially designed architecture and an enhanced reinforcement learning strategy. To the best of our knowledge, NAR4TSP is the first TSP solver that successfully combines RL and NAR networks. The key lies in the incorporation of NAR network output decoding into the training process. NAR4TSP efficiently represents TSP encoded information as rewards and seamlessly integrates it into reinforcement learning strategies, while maintaining consistent TSP sequence constraints during both training and testing phases. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world TSPs demonstrate that NAR4TSP outperforms five state-of-the-art models in terms of solution quality, inference speed, and generalization to unseen scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Talfan Evans, Shreya Pathak, Hamza Merzic, Jonathan Schwarz, Ryutaro Tanno, Olivier J. Henaff</p>
<p>Abstract: Power-law scaling indicates that large-scale training with uniform sampling is prohibitively slow. Active learning methods aim to increase data efficiency by prioritizing learning on the most relevant examples. Despite their appeal, these methods have yet to be widely adopted since no one algorithm has been shown to a) generalize across models and tasks b) scale to large datasets and c) yield overall FLOP savings when accounting for the overhead of data selection. In this work we propose a method which satisfies these three properties, leveraging small, cheap proxy models to estimate "learnability" scores for datapoints, which are used to prioritize data for the training of much larger models. As a result, our models require 46% and 51% fewer training updates and up to 25% less total computation to reach the same performance as uniformly trained visual classifiers on JFT and multimodal models on ALIGN. Finally, we find our data-prioritization scheme to be complementary with recent data-curation and learning objectives, yielding a new state-of-the-art in several multimodal transfer tasks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15198">Do LLM Agents Exhibit Social Behavior?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Leng, Yuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLMs increasingly take on roles in human-AI interactions and autonomous AI systems, understanding their social behavior becomes important for informed use and continuous improvement. However, their behaviors in social interactions with humans and other agents, as well as the mechanisms shaping their responses, remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework, State-Understanding-Value-Action (SUVA), to systematically analyze LLM responses in social contexts based on their textual outputs (i.e., utterances). Using canonical behavioral economics games and social preference concepts relatable to LLM users, SUVA assesses LLMs' social behavior through both their final decisions and the response generation processes leading to those decisions. Our analysis of eight LLMs -- including two GPT, four LLaMA, and two Mistral models -- suggests that most models do not generate decisions aligned solely with self-interest; instead, they often produce responses that reflect social welfare considerations and display patterns consistent with direct and indirect reciprocity. Additionally, higher-capacity models more frequently display group identity effects. The SUVA framework also provides explainable tools -- including tree-based visualizations and probabilistic dependency analysis -- to elucidate how factors in LLMs' utterance-based reasoning influence their decisions. We demonstrate that utterance-based reasoning reliably predicts LLMs' final actions; references to altruism, fairness, and cooperation in the reasoning increase the likelihood of prosocial actions, while mentions of self-interest and competition reduce them. Overall, our framework enables practitioners to assess LLMs for applications involving social interactions, and provides researchers with a structured method to interpret how LLM behavior arises from utterance-based reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Baolong Bi, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Wenjie Feng, Lizhe Chen, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Citywalk, a recently popular form of urban travel, requires genuine personalization and understanding of fine-grained requests compared to traditional itinerary planning. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), which generates personalized urban itineraries from user requests in natural language. We then present ITINERA, an OUIP system that integrates spatial optimization with large language models to provide customized urban itineraries based on user needs. This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary. Experiments on real-world datasets and the performance of the deployed system demonstrate our system's capacity to deliver personalized and spatially coherent itineraries compared to current solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Li, Xuzheng He, Haozhe Wang, Linlin Wang, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Program-of-Thought (PoT) replaces natural language-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as the most popular method in Large Language Models (LLMs) mathematical reasoning tasks by utilizing external tool calls to circumvent computational errors. However, our evaluation of the GPT-4 and Llama series reveals that using PoT introduces more reasoning errors, such as incorrect formulas or flawed logic, compared to CoT. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems. Our method achieves an average improvement of 6.5% on the Llama-Base model and 4.3% on the Mistral-Base model across 8 mathematical calculation datasets. It also shows significant effectiveness on five out-of-domain datasets by controlling the model's information flow, exhibiting strong transferability. Additionally, HTL shows the most significant improvement in non-mathematical natural language inference task, contributing to a unified reasoning task framework</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11891">Large Language Models Can Solve Real-World Planning Rigorously with Formal Verification Tools</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yilun Hao, Yongchao Chen, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their recent advancements, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to directly generate correct plans for complex multi-constraint planning problems, even with self-verification and self-critique. For example, a U.S. domestic travel planning benchmark TravelPlanner was proposed in Xie et al. (2024), where the best LLM OpenAI o1-preview can only find travel plans that satisfy user requirements with a 10% success rate given all needed information. In this work, we tackle this difficult problem by proposing an LLM-based planning framework that formalizes and solves complex multi-constraint planning problems as constrained satisfiability problems, which are further consumed by sound and complete satisfiability solvers. We start with TravelPlanner as the primary use case and achieve a success rate of 93.9%. We demonstrate our framework's robustness by showing its effectiveness in diverse paraphrased prompts. More importantly, our framework has strong zero-shot generalizability: It can successfully handle unseen constraints in a completely unseen international travel dataset we created, and it can even generalize well to new domains such as routing and task allocation problems in a zero-shot manner. Moreover, when user input queries are infeasible, our framework can identify the unsatisfiable core, provide failure reasons, and offers personalized modification suggestions to users according to diverse human preferences. We show that our framework can modify and solve for an average of 81.6% and 91.7% unsatisfiable queries from two datasets and prove with ablations that all key components of our framework are effective and necessary.</p>

<p>Abstract: One strategy in response to pluralistic values in a user population is to personalize an AI system: if the AI can adapt to the specific values of each individual, then we can potentially avoid many of the challenges of pluralism. Unfortunately, this approach creates a significant ethical issue: if there is an external measure of success for the human-AI team, then the adaptive AI system may develop strategies (sometimes deceptive) to compensate for its human teammate. This phenomenon can be viewed as a form of social compensation, where the AI makes decisions based not on predefined goals but on its human partner's deficiencies in relation to the team's performance objectives. We provide a practical ethical analysis of the conditions in which such compensation may nonetheless be justifiable.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rationality is the quality of being guided by reason, characterized by decision-making that aligns with evidence and logical principles. It plays a crucial role in reliable problem-solving by ensuring well-grounded and consistent solutions. While large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in generating human-like text, they still exhibit limitations such as bounded knowledge space and inconsistent outputs. In response, recent efforts have shifted toward developing multimodal and multi-agent systems, as well as integrating modules like external tools, programming codes, symbolic reasoners, utility function, and conformal risk controls rather than relying solely on a single LLM for decision-making. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art advancements in language and multimodal agents, evaluates how they contribute to make intelligent agents more rational, and identifies open challenges and future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaowen Sun, Xufeng Zhao, Jae Hee Lee, Wenhao Lu, Matthias Kerzel, Stefan Wermter</p>
<p>Abstract: The state of an object reflects its current status or condition and is important for a robot's task planning and manipulation. However, detecting an object's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i) a modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense captioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii) a monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for object state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the modular approach. The code for OSSA is available at https://github.com/Xiao-wen-Sun/OSSA</p>

<p>Abstract: The effective alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with precise instructions is essential for their application in diverse real-world scenarios. Current methods focus on enhancing the diversity and complexity of training and evaluation samples, yet they fall short in accurately assessing LLMs' ability to follow similar instruction variants. We introduce an effective data augmentation technique DeMoRecon that decomposes complex instructions into simpler sub-components, modifies these, and reconstructs them into new variants, thereby preserves the original instruction's context and complexity while introducing variability, which is critical for training and evaluating LLMs' instruction-following precision. Based on DeMoRecon, we developed the FGIV dataset which contains fine-grained instruction variants of 1,773 seed instructions to both fine-tune and evaluate LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs fine-tuned with FGIV will gain significant performance boost on both ours and commonly used instructions-following benchmarks.</p>

As a sibling project to SafeRLHF and BeaverTails, we separate annotations of helpfulness and harmlessness for question-answering pairs, providing distinct perspectives on these coupled attributes. Overall, we provide 44.6k refined prompts and 265k question-answer pairs with safety meta-labels for 19 harm categories and three severity levels ranging from minor to severe, with answers generated by Llama-family models. Based on this, we collected 166.8k preference data, including dual-preference (helpfulness and harmlessness decoupled) and single-preference data (trade-off the helpfulness and harmlessness from scratch), respectively. Using the large-scale annotation data, we further train severity-sensitive moderation for the risk control of LLMs and safety-centric RLHF algorithms for the safety alignment of LLMs. We believe this dataset will be a valuable resource for the community, aiding in the safe deployment of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xusen Guo, Xinxi Yang, Mingxing Peng, Hongliang Lu, Meixin Zhu, Hai Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing efficient traffic models is essential for optimizing transportation systems, yet current approaches remain time-intensive and susceptible to human errors due to their reliance on manual processes. Traditional workflows involve exhaustive literature reviews, formula optimization, and iterative testing, leading to inefficiencies in research. In response, we introduce the Traffic Research Agent (TR-Agent), an AI-driven system designed to autonomously develop and refine traffic models through an iterative, closed-loop process. Specifically, we divide the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation, theory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization; and construct TR-Agent with four corresponding modules: Idea Generator, Code Generator, Evaluator, and Analyzer. Working in synergy, these modules retrieve knowledge from external resources, generate novel ideas, implement and debug models, and finally assess them on the evaluation datasets. Furthermore, the system continuously refines these models based on iterative feedback, enhancing research efficiency and model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that TR-Agent achieves significant performance improvements across multiple traffic models, including the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for car following, the MOBIL lane-changing model, and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) traffic flow model. Additionally, TR-Agent provides detailed explanations for its optimizations, allowing researchers to verify and build upon its improvements easily. This flexibility makes the framework a powerful tool for researchers in transportation and beyond. To further support research and collaboration, we have open-sourced both the code and data used in our experiments, facilitating broader access and enabling continued advancements in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing benchmarks like NLGraph and GraphQA evaluate LLMs on graphs by focusing mainly on pairwise relationships, overlooking the high-order correlations found in real-world data. Hypergraphs, which can model complex beyond-pairwise relationships, offer a more robust framework but are still underexplored in the context of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce LLM4Hypergraph, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 21,500 problems across eight low-order, five high-order, and two isomorphism tasks, utilizing both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs from citation networks and protein structures. We evaluate six prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, demonstrating our benchmark's effectiveness in identifying model strengths and weaknesses. Our specialized prompting framework incorporates seven hypergraph languages and introduces two novel techniques, Hyper-BAG and Hyper-COT, which enhance high-order reasoning and achieve an average 4% (up to 9%) performance improvement on structure classification tasks. This work establishes a foundational testbed for integrating hypergraph computational capabilities into LLMs, advancing their comprehension.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanying Wang, Zeyu Ma, Pengfei Liu, Mingang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been developed, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across different domains remains significant. Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, aimless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this issue, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two concepts: Benchmark+, which extends traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible "strategy-criterion" format; and Assessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper exploration and supporting both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights. These concepts capture the nuanced behaviors of LLMs through richer, multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called TestAgent, which implements these concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing vertical domain evaluation to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TestAgent across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarek Naous, Michael J. Ryan, Anton Lavrouk, Mohit Chandra, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of large language models for multilingual readability assessment. Existing evaluation resources lack domain and language diversity, limiting the ability for cross-domain and cross-lingual analyses. This paper introduces ReadMe++, a multilingual multi-domain dataset with human annotations of 9757 sentences in Arabic, English, French, Hindi, and Russian, collected from 112 different data sources. This benchmark will encourage research on developing robust multilingual readability assessment methods. Using ReadMe++, we benchmark multilingual and monolingual language models in the supervised, unsupervised, and few-shot prompting settings. The domain and language diversity in ReadMe++ enable us to test more effective few-shot prompting, and identify shortcomings in state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. Our experiments also reveal exciting results of superior domain generalization and enhanced cross-lingual transfer capabilities by models trained on ReadMe++. We will make our data publicly available and release a python package tool for multilingual sentence readability prediction using our trained models at: https://github.com/tareknaous/readme</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqing Xu, Finale Doshi-Velez, David Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms often rely on (forward) reinforcement learning or planning over a given time horizon to compute an approximately optimal policy for a hypothesized reward function and then match this policy with expert demonstrations. The time horizon plays a critical role in determining both the accuracy of reward estimates and the computational efficiency of IRL algorithms. Interestingly, an \emph{effective time horizon} shorter than the ground-truth value often produces better results faster. This work formally analyzes this phenomenon and provides an explanation: the time horizon controls the complexity of an induced policy class and mitigates overfitting with limited data. This analysis serves as a guide for the principled choice of the effective horizon for IRL. It also prompts us to re-examine the classic IRL formulation: it is more natural to learn jointly the reward and the effective horizon rather than the reward alone with a given horizon. To validate our findings, we implement a cross-validation extension and the experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Liu, Liangxi Liu, Feiyang Ye, Yunheng Shen, Xia Li, Linshan Jiang, Jialin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficiently aggregating trained neural networks from local clients into a global model on a server is a widely researched topic in federated learning. Recently, motivated by diminishing privacy concerns, mitigating potential attacks, and reducing communication overhead, one-shot federated learning (i.e., limiting client-server communication into a single round) has gained popularity among researchers. However, the one-shot aggregation performances are sensitively affected by the non-identical training data distribution, which exhibits high statistical heterogeneity in some real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel one-shot aggregation method with layer-wise posterior aggregation, named FedLPA. FedLPA aggregates local models to obtain a more accurate global model without requiring extra auxiliary datasets or exposing any private label information, e.g., label distributions. To effectively capture the statistics maintained in the biased local datasets in the practical non-IID scenario, we efficiently infer the posteriors of each layer in each local model using layer-wise Laplace approximation and aggregate them to train the global parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedLPA significantly improves learning performance over state-of-the-art methods across several metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arvind Renganathan, Rahul Ghosh, Ankush Khandelwal, Vipin Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce TAM-RL (Task Aware Modulation using Representation Learning), a novel multimodal meta-learning framework for few-shot learning in heterogeneous systems, designed for science and engineering problems where entities share a common underlying forward model but exhibit heterogeneity due to entity-specific characteristics. TAM-RL leverages an amortized training process with a modulation network and a base network to learn task-specific modulation parameters, enabling efficient adaptation to new tasks with limited data. We evaluate TAM-RL on two real-world environmental datasets: Gross Primary Product (GPP) prediction and streamflow forecasting, demonstrating significant improvements over existing meta-learning methods. On the FLUXNET dataset, TAM-RL improves RMSE by 18.9\% over MMAML with just one month of few-shot data, while for streamflow prediction, it achieves an 8.21\% improvement with one year of data. Synthetic data experiments further validate TAM-RL's superior performance in heterogeneous task distributions, outperforming the baselines in the most heterogeneous setting. Notably, TAM-RL offers substantial computational efficiency, with at least 3x faster training times compared to gradient-based meta-learning approaches while being much simpler to train due to reduced complexity. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretraining and adaptation mechanisms in TAM-RL's performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mufei Li, Eleonora Krea\v{c}i\'c, Vamsi K. Potluru, Pan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale graphs with node attributes are increasingly common in various real-world applications. Creating synthetic, attribute-rich graphs that mirror real-world examples is crucial, especially for sharing graph data for analysis and developing learning models when original data is restricted to be shared. Traditional graph generation methods are limited in their capacity to handle these complex structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown potential in generating graph structures without attributes and smaller molecular graphs. However, these models face challenges in generating large attributed graphs due to the complex attribute-structure correlations and the large size of these graphs. This paper introduces a novel diffusion model, GraphMaker, specifically designed for generating large attributed graphs. We explore various combinations of node attribute and graph structure generation processes, finding that an asynchronous approach more effectively captures the intricate attribute-structure correlations. We also address scalability issues through edge mini-batching generation. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach in graph data dissemination, we introduce a new evaluation pipeline. The evaluation demonstrates that synthetic graphs generated by GraphMaker can be used to develop competitive graph machine learning models for the tasks defined over the original graphs without actually accessing these graphs, while many leading graph generation methods fall short in this evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nuo Chen, Zinan Zheng, Ning Wu, Ming Gong, Dongmei Zhang, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing research predominantly focuses on developing powerful language learning models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning within monolingual languages, with few explorations in preserving efficacy in a multilingual context. To bridge this gap, this paper pioneers exploring and training powerful Multilingual Math Reasoning (xMR) LLMs. Firstly, by utilizing translation, we construct the first multilingual math reasoning instruction dataset, MGSM8KInstruct, encompassing ten distinct languages, thus addressing the issue of training data scarcity in xMR tasks. Based on the collected dataset, we propose different training strategies to build powerful xMR LLMs, named MathOctopus, notably outperform conventional open-source LLMs and exhibit superiority over ChatGPT in few-shot scenarios. Notably, MathOctopus-13B reaches 47.6% accuracy which exceeds ChatGPT 46.3% on MGSM testset. Beyond remarkable results, we unearth several pivotal observations and insights from extensive experiments: (1) When extending the rejection sampling strategy to the multilingual context, it proves effective for model performances, albeit limited. (2) Employing parallel corpora for math Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) across multiple languages not only significantly enhances model performance multilingually but also elevates their monolingual performance. This indicates that crafting multilingual corpora can be regarded as a vital strategy for enhancing model performance in a specific language, especially in mathematical reasoning tasks. For instance, MathOctopus-7B improves its counterparts that trained on English from 42.2% to 50.8% on GSM8K testset. Codes are available at https://github.com/microsoft/MathOctopus.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaodan Du, Nicholas Kolkin, Greg Shakhnarovich, Anand Bhattad</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative models excel at mimicking real scenes, suggesting they might inherently encode important intrinsic scene properties. In this paper, we aim to explore the following key questions: (1) What intrinsic knowledge do generative models like GANs, Autoregressive models, and Diffusion models encode? (2) Can we establish a general framework to recover intrinsic representations from these models, regardless of their architecture or model type? (3) How minimal can the required learnable parameters and labeled data be to successfully recover this knowledge? (4) Is there a direct link between the quality of a generative model and the accuracy of the recovered scene intrinsics?
  Our findings indicate that a small Low-Rank Adaptators (LoRA) can recover intrinsic images-depth, normals, albedo and shading-across different generators (Autoregressive, GANs and Diffusion) while using the same decoder head that generates the image. As LoRA is lightweight, we introduce very few learnable parameters (as few as 0.04% of Stable Diffusion model weights for a rank of 2), and we find that as few as 250 labeled images are enough to generate intrinsic images with these LoRA modules. Finally, we also show a positive correlation between the generative model's quality and the accuracy of the recovered intrinsics through control experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunjae Lee, Junyoung Choi, Jungjae Lee, Munim Hasan Wasi, Hojun Choi, Steven Y. Ko, Sangeun Oh, Insik Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the field of mobile task automation. Their superior language understanding and reasoning capabilities allow users to automate complex and repetitive tasks. However, due to the inherent unreliability and high operational cost of LLMs, their practical applicability is quite limited. To address these issues, this paper introduces MobileGPT, an innovative LLM-based mobile task automator equipped with a human-like app memory. MobileGPT emulates the cognitive process of humans interacting with a mobile app -- explore, select, derive, and recall. This approach allows for a more precise and efficient learning of a task's procedure by breaking it down into smaller, modular sub-tasks that can be re-used, re-arranged, and adapted for various objectives. We implement MobileGPT using online LLMs services (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and evaluate its performance on a dataset of 185 tasks across 18 mobile apps. The results indicate that MobileGPT can automate and learn new tasks with 82.7% accuracy, and is able to adapt them to different contexts with near perfect (98.75%) accuracy while reducing both latency and cost by 62.5% and 68.8%, respectively, compared to the GPT-4 powered baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yatong Bai, Mo Zhou, Vishal M. Patel, Somayeh Sojoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial robustness often comes at the cost of degraded accuracy, impeding real-life applications of robust classification models. Training-based solutions for better trade-offs are limited by incompatibilities with already-trained high-performance large models, necessitating the exploration of training-free ensemble approaches. Observing that robust models are more confident in correct predictions than in incorrect ones on clean and adversarial data alike, we speculate amplifying this "benign confidence property" can reconcile accuracy and robustness in an ensemble setting. To achieve so, we propose "MixedNUTS", a training-free method where the output logits of a robust classifier and a standard non-robust classifier are processed by nonlinear transformations with only three parameters, which are optimized through an efficient algorithm. MixedNUTS then converts the transformed logits into probabilities and mixes them as the overall output. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, experimental results with custom strong adaptive attacks demonstrate MixedNUTS's vastly improved accuracy and near-SOTA robustness -- it boosts CIFAR-100 clean accuracy by 7.86 points, sacrificing merely 0.87 points in robust accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiafei Lyu, Le Wan, Xiu Li, Zongqing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there are many efforts attempting to learn useful policies for continuous control in visual reinforcement learning (RL). In this scenario, it is important to learn a generalizable policy, as the testing environment may differ from the training environment, e.g., there exist distractors during deployment. Many practical algorithms are proposed to handle this problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide a theoretical understanding of what affects the generalization gap and why their proposed methods work. In this paper, we bridge this issue by theoretically answering the key factors that contribute to the generalization gap when the testing environment has distractors. Our theories indicate that minimizing the representation distance between training and testing environments, which aligns with human intuition, is the most critical for the benefit of reducing the generalization gap. Our theoretical results are supported by the empirical evidence in the DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Ding, Amy Zhang, Yuandong Tian, Qinqing Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Diffusion World Model (DWM), a conditional diffusion model capable of predicting multistep future states and rewards concurrently. As opposed to traditional one-step dynamics models, DWM offers long-horizon predictions in a single forward pass, eliminating the need for recursive queries. We integrate DWM into model-based value estimation, where the short-term return is simulated by future trajectories sampled from DWM. In the context of offline reinforcement learning, DWM can be viewed as a conservative value regularization through generative modeling. Alternatively, it can be seen as a data source that enables offline Q-learning with synthetic data. Our experiments on the D4RL dataset confirm the robustness of DWM to long-horizon simulation. In terms of absolute performance, DWM significantly surpasses one-step dynamics models with a $44\%$ performance gain, and is comparable to or slightly surpassing their model-free counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiang River Dong, Hongzhou Lin, Mikhail Belkin, Ramon Huerta, Ivan Vuli\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Mitigating the retention of sensitive or private information in large language models is essential for enhancing privacy and safety. Existing unlearning methods, like Gradient Ascent and Negative Preference Optimization, directly tune models to remove unwanted information. However, these methods often become unstable because they fine-tune by maximizing cross-entropy loss, which is the opposite of traditional loss minimization in learning. This reversal creates instability, especially on larger datasets, as the model struggles to balance unlearning with maintaining language capacity, leading to over-unlearning. In this paper, we introduce UnDIAL (Unlearning via Self-Distillation on Adjusted Logits), a novel and robust unlearning method. Our approach leverages self-distillation to adjust logits and selectively reduce the influence of targeted tokens. This technique ensures smooth convergence and avoids catastrophic forgetting, even in challenging unlearning tasks with large datasets and sequential unlearning requests. Extensive experiments show that UnDIAL can achieve both robustness in unlearning and scalability while maintaining stable training dynamics and resilience to hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: The robustness of AI-content detection models against sophisticated adversarial strategies, such as paraphrasing or word switching, is a rising concern in natural language generation (NLG) applications. This study proposes ToBlend, a novel token-level ensemble text generation method to challenge the robustness of current AI-content detection approaches by utilizing multiple sets of candidate generative large language models (LLMs). By randomly sampling token(s) from candidate LLMs sets, we find ToBlend significantly drops the performance of most mainstream AI-content detection methods. We evaluate the text quality produced under different ToBlend settings based on annotations from experienced human experts. We proposed a fine-tuned Llama3.1 model to distinguish the ToBlend generated text more accurately. Our findings underscore our proposed text generation approach's great potential in deceiving and improving detection models. Our datasets, codes, and annotations are open-sourced.</p>

<p>Abstract: The therapeutic working alliance is a critical factor in predicting the success of psychotherapy treatment. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach utilizes advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze transcripts of psychotherapy sessions and compare them with distributed representations of statements in the working alliance inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions covering diverse psychiatric conditions including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal tendencies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories and offering interpretability for clinical psychiatry and in identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and their evolution at a turn-level resolution. This combined framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enabling timely feedback for therapists regarding the quality of therapeutic relationships and providing interpretable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangming Huang, Yingya Li, Shoaib Jameel, Yunfei Long, Giorgos Papanastasiou</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has substantially enhanced natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare research. However, the increasing complexity of DL-based NLP necessitates transparent model interpretability, or at least explainability, for reliable decision-making. This work presents a thorough scoping review of explainable and interpretable DL in healthcare NLP. The term "eXplainable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence" (XIAI) is introduced to distinguish XAI from IAI. Different models are further categorized based on their functionality (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global). Our analysis shows that attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging IAI technique. The use of IAI is growing, distinguishing it from XAI. The major challenges identified are that most XIAI does not explore "global" modelling processes, the lack of best practices, and the lack of systematic evaluation and benchmarks. One important opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine. Additionally, combining DL with causal logic holds promise. Our discussion encourages the integration of XIAI in Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-specific smaller models. In conclusion, XIAI adoption in healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise. Collaboration with domain experts, end-users, and policymakers can lead to ready-to-use XIAI methods across NLP and medical tasks. While challenges exist, XIAI techniques offer a valuable foundation for interpretable NLP algorithms in healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Canadian air travel sector has seen a significant increase in flight delays, cancellations, and other issues concerning passenger rights. Recognizing this demand, we present a chatbot to assist passengers and educate them about their rights. Our system breaks a complex user input into simple queries which are used to retrieve information from a collection of documents detailing air travel regulations. The most relevant passages from these documents are presented along with links to the original documents and the generated queries, enabling users to dissect and leverage the information for their unique circumstances. The system successfully overcomes two predominant challenges: understanding complex user inputs, and delivering accurate answers, free of hallucinations, that passengers can rely on for making informed decisions. A user study comparing the chatbot to a Google search demonstrated the chatbot's usefulness and ease of use. Beyond the primary goal of providing accurate and timely information to air passengers regarding their rights, we hope that this system will also enable further research exploring the tradeoff between the user-friendly conversational interface of chatbots and the accuracy of retrieval systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadi Alijani, Jamil Fayyad, Homayoun Najjaran</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are often evaluated in scenarios where the data distribution is different from those used in the training and validation phases. The discrepancy presents a challenge for accurately predicting the performance of models once deployed on the target distribution. Domain adaptation and generalization are widely recognized as effective strategies for addressing such shifts, thereby ensuring reliable performance. The recent promising results in applying vision transformers in computer vision tasks, coupled with advancements in self-attention mechanisms, have demonstrated their significant potential for robustness and generalization in handling distribution shifts. Motivated by the increased interest from the research community, our paper investigates the deployment of vision transformers in domain adaptation and domain generalization scenarios. For domain adaptation methods, we categorize research into feature-level, instance-level, model-level adaptations, and hybrid approaches, along with other categorizations with respect to diverse strategies for enhancing domain adaptation. Similarly, for domain generalization, we categorize research into multi-domain learning, meta-learning, regularization techniques, and data augmentation strategies. We further classify diverse strategies in research, underscoring the various approaches researchers have taken to address distribution shifts by integrating vision transformers. The inclusion of comprehensive tables summarizing these categories is a distinct feature of our work, offering valuable insights for researchers. These findings highlight the versatility of vision transformers in managing distribution shifts, crucial for real-world applications, especially in critical safety and decision-making scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Broadcast sports field registration is traditionally addressed as a homography estimation task, mapping the visible image area to a planar field model, predominantly focusing on the main camera shot. Addressing the shortcomings of previous approaches, we propose a novel calibration pipeline enabling camera calibration using a 3D soccer field model and extending the process to assess the multiple-view nature of broadcast videos. Our approach begins with a keypoint generation pipeline derived from SoccerNet dataset annotations, leveraging the geometric properties of the court. Subsequently, we execute classical camera calibration through DLT algorithm in a minimalist fashion, without further refinement. Through extensive experimentation on real-world soccer broadcast datasets such as SoccerNet-Calibration, WorldCup 2014 and TS- WorldCup, our method demonstrates superior performance in both multiple- and single-view 3D camera calibration while maintaining competitive results in homography estimation compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians has attracted remarkable attention. Existing works mainly adopt the close-ended question-answering (QA) task with answer options for evaluation. However, many clinical decisions involve answering open-ended questions without pre-set options. To better understand LLMs in the clinic, we construct a benchmark ClinicBench. We first collect eleven existing datasets covering diverse clinical language generation, understanding, and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we construct six novel datasets and clinical tasks that are complex but common in real-world practice, e.g., open-ended decision-making, long document processing, and emerging drug analysis. We conduct an extensive evaluation of twenty-two LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Finally, we invite medical experts to evaluate the clinical usefulness of LLMs. The benchmark data is available at https://github.com/AI-in-Health/ClinicBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arkadiy Saakyan, Shreyas Kulkarni, Tuhin Chakrabarty, Smaranda Muresan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks requiring a fine-grained understanding of literal meaning in images and text, such as visual question-answering or visual entailment. However, there has been little exploration of these models' capabilities when presented with images and captions containing figurative meaning, such as metaphors or humor. To close this gap, we propose a new task framing the figurative meaning understanding problem as an explainable visual entailment task, where the model has to predict whether the image (premise) entails a caption (hypothesis) and justify the predicted label with a textual explanation. The figurative phenomena can be present either in the image, the caption, or both. Utilizing a human-AI collaboration approach, we build the accompanying expert-verified dataset V-FLUTE, containing 6,027 {image, caption, label, explanation} instances spanning five diverse figurative phenomena: metaphors, similes, idioms, sarcasm, and humor. Through automatic evaluation, we find that VLMs struggle to generalize from literal to figurative meaning, particularly when it is present in images. Further, we identify common types of errors in VLM reasoning via human evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyu Liang, Heshan Liu, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Zhuoyan Xu, Junze Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The self-attention mechanism is the key to the success of transformers in recent Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the quadratic computational cost $O(n^2)$ in the input sequence length $n$ is a notorious obstacle for further improvement and scalability in longer contexts. In this work, we leverage the convolution-like structure of attention matrices to develop an efficient approximation method for attention computation using convolution matrices. We propose a $\mathsf{conv}$ basis system, analogous to the rank basis, and show that any lower triangular matrix can always be decomposed as a sum of structured convolution matrices in this basis. We then design a fast algorithm to approximate the attention matrix via a sum of such $k$ convolution matrices. This allows us to compute the attention {\it inference} via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in $O(knd \log n)$ time, where $d$ is the hidden dimension, and thus achieve almost linear time $n^{1+o(1)}$ in the practical scenario where $kd = n^{o(1)}$. Furthermore, the attention {\it training forward} and {\it backward gradient} can be computed in $n^{1+o(1)}$ as well. We provide theoretical guarantees on the run time and approximation error and conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. We hope our new paradigm for accelerating attention computation in transformer models can help their application to longer contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have distinguished themselves with outstanding performance in complex language modeling tasks, yet they come with significant computational and storage challenges. This paper explores the potential of quantization to mitigate these challenges. We systematically study the combined application of three well-known post-training techniques, SmoothQuant, AWQ, and GPTQ, and provide a comprehensive analysis of their interactions and implications for advancing LLM quantization. We enhance the versatility of these methods by enabling quantization to microscaling (MX) formats, extending the applicability of these PTQ algorithms beyond their original fixed-point format targets. We show that combining different PTQ methods enables us to quantize models to 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations using the MXINT format with negligible accuracy loss compared to the uncompressed baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiqing Xu, Jiayuan Mao, Yilun Du, Tomas Loz\'ano-P\'erez, Leslie Pack Kaebling, David Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the challenge of developing robots capable of understanding under-specified instructions for creating functional object arrangements, such as "set up a dining table for two"; previous arrangement approaches have focused on much more explicit instructions, such as "put object A on the table." We introduce a framework, SetItUp, for learning to interpret under-specified instructions. SetItUp takes a small number of training examples and a human-crafted program sketch to uncover arrangement rules for specific scene types. By leveraging an intermediate graph-like representation of abstract spatial relationships among objects, SetItUp decomposes the arrangement problem into two subproblems: i) learning the arrangement patterns from limited data and ii) grounding these abstract relationships into object poses. SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose the abstract spatial relationships among objects in novel scenes as the constraints to be satisfied; then, it composes a library of diffusion models associated with these abstract relationships to find object poses that satisfy the constraints. We validate our framework on a dataset comprising study desks, dining tables, and coffee tables, with the results showing superior performance in generating physically plausible, functional, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements compared to existing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Govind Ramesh, Yao Dou, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Research on jailbreaking has been valuable for testing and understanding the safety and security issues of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce Iterative Refinement Induced Self-Jailbreak (IRIS), a novel approach that leverages the reflective capabilities of LLMs for jailbreaking with only black-box access. Unlike previous methods, IRIS simplifies the jailbreaking process by using a single model as both the attacker and target. This method first iteratively refines adversarial prompts through self-explanation, which is crucial for ensuring that even well-aligned LLMs obey adversarial instructions. IRIS then rates and enhances the output given the refined prompt to increase its harmfulness. We find that IRIS achieves jailbreak success rates of 98% on GPT-4, 92% on GPT-4 Turbo, and 94% on Llama-3.1-70B in under 7 queries. It significantly outperforms prior approaches in automatic, black-box, and interpretable jailbreaking, while requiring substantially fewer queries, thereby establishing a new standard for interpretable jailbreaking methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Zekun Xi, Mengru Wang, Ziwen Xu, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinliang Zheng, Jianxiong Li, Sijie Cheng, Yinan Zheng, Jiaming Li, Jihao Liu, Yu Liu, Jingjing Liu, Xianyuan Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction following is crucial in contemporary LLM. However, when extended to multimodal setting, it often suffers from misalignment between specific textual instruction and targeted local region of an image. To achieve more accurate and nuanced multimodal instruction following, we introduce Instruction-guided Visual Masking (IVM), a new versatile visual grounding model that is compatible with diverse multimodal models, such as LMM and robot model. By constructing visual masks for instruction-irrelevant regions, IVM-enhanced multimodal models can effectively focus on task-relevant image regions to better align with complex instructions. Specifically, we design a visual masking data generation pipeline and create an IVM-Mix-1M dataset with 1 million image-instruction pairs. We further introduce a new learning technique, Discriminator Weighted Supervised Learning (DWSL) for preferential IVM training that prioritizes high-quality data samples. Experimental results on generic multimodal tasks such as VQA and embodied robotic control demonstrate the versatility of IVM, which as a plug-and-play tool, significantly boosts the performance of diverse multimodal models, yielding new state-of-the-art results across challenging multimodal benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> John T. Halloran, Manbir Gulati, Paul F. Roysdon</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba state-space models (SSMs) were recently shown to outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer large language models (LLMs) across various tasks. Despite subsequent widespread adaptation, little work has focused on Mamba LLMs' amenability for fine-tuning frameworks ubiquitously used for Transformer-based LLMs, e.g., mixed-precision fine-tuning (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). For the former, it currently remains an open question whether Mamba's recurrent dynamics are robust to small input changes, such as those encountered during MPFT. Using dynamical systems theory (in particular, Lyapunov exponents), we answer this question in the affirmative. We empirically validate this result through several experiments, showing that Mamba SSMs are significantly more stable to changes introduced by mixed-precision than comparable Transformers, even when both MPFT and PEFT are combined. For PEFT, we show how targeting specific memory buffers in Mamba's customized CUDA kernels for low-rank adaptation regularizes SSM parameters, thus providing both parameter efficient learning and computational savings. Finally, with both MPFT and PEFT enabled, we explore the impact of instruction tuning Mamba SSMs for in-context learning (ICL) on natural language tasks. While pretrained Mamba and Mamba-2 models only achieve 38% and 82% (respectively) of the ICL improvements of comparable Transformer-based LLMs, we show that instruction tuning allows Mamba models to narrow this gap to 81% and Mamba-2 models to skyrocket over this gap to 132%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsheng Yuan, Zhuangkun Wei, Weisi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Over-the-Air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed learning mechanism, by aggregating updates in the electromagnetic channel rather than at the server. A critical research gap in existing OTA-FL research is the assumption of homogeneous client computational bit precision. While in real world application, clients with varying hardware resources may exploit approximate computing (AxC) to operate at different bit precisions optimized for energy and computational efficiency. And model updates of various precisions amongst clients poses an open challenge for OTA-FL, as it is incompatible in the wireless modulation superposition. Here, we propose an mixed-precision OTA-FL framework of clients with multiple bit precisions, demonstrating the following innovations: (i) the superior trade-off for both server and clients within the constraints of varying edge computing capabilities, energy efficiency, and learning accuracy requirements comparing to homogeneous client bit precision, and (ii) a multi-precision gradient modulation scheme to ensure compatibility with OTA aggregation and eliminate the overheads of precision conversion. Through case study with real world data, we validate our modulation scheme that enables AxC based mixed-precision OTA-FL. In comparison to homogeneous standard precision of 32-bit and 16-bit, our framework presents more than 10% in 4-bit ultra low precision client performance and over 65%and 13% of energy savings respectively. This demonstrates the great potential of our mixed-precision OTA-FL approach in heterogeneous edge computing environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuyan Xiong, Chengyu Shen, Xiaoqi Li, Kaichen Zhou, Jiaming Liu, Ruiping Wang, Hao Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: The ability to reflect on and correct failures is crucial for robotic systems to interact stably with real-life objects. Observing the generalization and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), previous approaches have aimed to utilize these models to enhance robotic systems accordingly. However, these methods typically focus on high-level planning corrections using an additional MLLM, with limited utilization of failed samples to correct low-level contact poses which is particularly prone to occur during articulated object manipulation. To address this gap, we propose an Autonomous Interactive Correction (AIC) MLLM, which makes use of previous low-level interaction experiences to correct SE(3) pose predictions for articulated object. Specifically, AIC MLLM is initially fine-tuned to acquire both pose prediction and feedback prompt comprehension abilities. We design two types of prompt instructions for interactions with objects: 1) visual masks to highlight unmovable parts for position correction, and 2) textual descriptions to indicate potential directions for rotation correction. During inference, a Feedback Information Extraction module is introduced to recognize the failure cause, allowing AIC MLLM to adaptively correct the pose prediction using the corresponding prompts. To further enhance manipulation stability, we devise a Test Time Adaptation strategy that enables AIC MLLM to better adapt to the current scene configuration. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted in both simulated and real-world environments to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our AIC MLLM can efficiently correct failure samples by leveraging interaction experience prompts. Our project website is https://sites.google.com/view/aic-mllm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boxuan Lyu, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Kotaro Funakoshi, Manabu Okumura</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximum a posteriori decoding, a commonly used method for neural machine translation (NMT), aims to maximize the estimated posterior probability. However, high estimated probability does not always lead to high translation quality. Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding (\citealp{kumar2004minimum}) offers an alternative by seeking hypotheses with the highest expected utility. In this paper, we show that Quality Estimation (QE) reranking (\citealp{fernandes-etal-2022-quality}), which uses a QE model as a reranker, can be viewed as a variant of MBR. Inspired by this, we propose source-based MBR (sMBR) decoding, a novel approach that utilizes synthetic sources (generated via back-translation or paraphrasing) as ``support hypotheses'' and a reference-free quality estimation metric as the utility function, marking the first work to solely use sources in MBR decoding. Experiments show that sMBR outperforms QE reranking and the standard MBR decoding. Our findings suggest that sMBR is a promising approach for NMT decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronny Luss, Erik Miehling, Amit Dhurandhar</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of black-box deep neural network classification models has sparked the need to explain their decisions. However, in the case of generative AI, such as large language models (LLMs), there is no class prediction to explain. Rather, one can ask why an LLM output a particular response to a given prompt. In this paper, we answer this question by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first contrastive explanation methods requiring simply black-box/query access. Our explanations suggest that an LLM outputs a reply to a given prompt because if the prompt was slightly modified, the LLM would have given a different response that is either less preferable or contradicts the original response. The key insight is that contrastive explanations simply require a scoring function that has meaning to the user and not necessarily a specific real valued quantity (viz. class label). We offer two algorithms for finding contrastive explanations: i) A myopic algorithm, which although effective in creating contrasts, requires many model calls and ii) A budgeted algorithm, our main algorithmic contribution, which intelligently creates contrasts adhering to a query budget, necessary for longer contexts. We show the efficacy of these methods on diverse natural language tasks such as open-text generation, automated red teaming, and explaining conversational degradation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for efficient document retrieval without relying on external indexes. However, DSI needs full re-training to handle updates in dynamic corpora, causing significant computational inefficiencies. We introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based rehearsal-free approach for instance-wise incremental learning document retrieval. PromptDSI attaches prompts to the frozen PLM's encoder of DSI, leveraging its powerful representation to efficiently index new corpora while maintaining a balance between stability and plasticity. We eliminate the initial forward pass of prompt-based continual learning methods that doubles training and inference time. Moreover, we propose a topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys. This strategy ensures diverse and effective prompt usage, addressing the challenge of parameter underutilization caused by the collapse of the query-key matching mechanism. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that BERT-based PromptDSI matches IncDSI in managing forgetting while improving new corpora performance by more than 4% Hits@10 on NQ320k and upto 3% MRR@10 on MS MARCO 300k.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optimal experimental design is a well studied field in applied science and engineering. Techniques for estimating such a design are commonly used within the framework of parameter estimation. Nonetheless, in recent years parameter estimation techniques are changing rapidly with the introduction of deep learning techniques to replace traditional estimation methods. This in turn requires the adaptation of optimal experimental design that is associated with these new techniques. In this paper we investigate a new experimental design methodology that uses deep learning. We show that the training of a network as a Likelihood Free Estimator can be used to significantly simplify the design process and circumvent the need for the computationally expensive bi-level optimization problem that is inherent in optimal experimental design for non-linear systems. Furthermore, deep design improves the quality of the recovery process for parameter estimation problems. As proof of concept we apply our methodology to two different systems of Ordinary Differential Equations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Chiwun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompting and context-based fine-tuning methods, which we call Prefix Learning, have been proposed to enhance the performance of language models on various downstream tasks. They are empirically efficient and effective, matching the performance of full parameter fine-tuning, but the theoretical understandings are limited. In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by studying their ability from the perspective of prefix length. In particular, we provide a convergence guarantee for training an ultra-long prefix in a stylized setting using the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework. Based on this strong theoretical guarantee, we design and implement an algorithm that only needs to introduce and fine-tune a few extra trainable parameters instead of an infinite-long prefix in each layer of a transformer, and can approximate the prefix attention to a guaranteed polynomial-small error. Preliminary experimental results on vision, natural language, and math data show that our method achieves superior or competitive performance compared to existing methods like full parameters fine-tuning, P-Tuning V2, and LoRA. This demonstrates our method is promising for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/ChristianYang37/chiwun/tree/main/src/NTK-Attention}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingwei Ni, Tobias Schimanski, Meihong Lin, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyle Wong, Alfonso Amayuelas, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on code generation tasks. A recent use case is iterative code repair, where an LLM fixes an incorrect program by rationalizing about errors and generating new code. Recent works augment the code repair process by integrating modern techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning or distillation, but only study their benefits on high-resource languages like Python, and ignore low-resource languages like Perl. To address this gap of knowledge, we investigate the benefits of distilling code repair for both high and low resource languages to determine if the techniques that are effective in a high resource setting are also applicable in a low resource setting. Our evaluation shows that distilling the ability to repair code has language dependent benefits. To explain this behavior, we perform a further analysis and find that contrary to preexisting beliefs, the correlation between reasoning ability and code correction ability is weak. We hypothesize this weak correlation is magnified in low-resource settings where base models lack deep knowledge of a programming language, leading to wavering benefits of code repair.</p>

<p>Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) typically utilizes classification criteria from output probabilities of manually selected label tokens. However, we argue that such token-based classification criteria lead to suboptimal decision boundaries, despite delicate calibrations through translation and constrained rotation applied. To address this problem, we propose Hidden Calibration, which renounces token probabilities and uses the nearest centroid classifier on the LM's last hidden states. In detail, we assign the label of the nearest centroid previously estimated from a calibration set to the test sample as the predicted label. Our experiments on 6 models and 10 classification datasets indicate that Hidden Calibration consistently outperforms current token-based baselines by about 20%~50%, achieving a strong state-of-the-art in ICL. Our further analysis demonstrates that Hidden Calibration finds better classification criteria with less inter-class overlap, and LMs provide linearly separable intra-class clusters with the help of demonstrations, which supports Hidden Calibration and gives new insights into the principle of ICL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amalie Brogaard Pauli, Isabelle Augenstein, Ira Assent</p>
<p>Abstract: We are exposed to much information trying to influence us, such as teaser messages, debates, politically framed news, and propaganda - all of which use persuasive language. With the recent interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study the ability of LLMs to produce persuasive text. As opposed to prior work which focuses on particular domains or types of persuasion, we conduct a general study across various domains to measure and benchmark to what degree LLMs produce persuasive language - both when explicitly instructed to rewrite text to be more or less persuasive and when only instructed to paraphrase. We construct the new dataset Persuasive-Pairs of pairs of a short text and its rewrite by an LLM to amplify or diminish persuasive language. We multi-annotate the pairs on a relative scale for persuasive language: a valuable resource in itself, and for training a regression model to score and benchmark persuasive language, including for new LLMs across domains. In our analysis, we find that different 'personas' in LLaMA3's system prompt change persuasive language substantially, even when only instructed to paraphrase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqi Yan, Yanzheng Xiang, Guangyi Chen, Yifei Wang, Lin Gui, Yulan He</p>
<p>Abstract: To better interpret the intrinsic mechanism of large language models (LLMs), recent studies focus on monosemanticity on its basic units. A monosemantic neuron is dedicated to a single and specific concept, which forms a one-to-one correlation between neurons and concepts. Despite extensive research in monosemanticity probing, it remains unclear whether monosemanticity is beneficial or harmful to model capacity. To explore this question, we revisit monosemanticity from the feature decorrelation perspective and advocate for its encouragement. We experimentally observe that the current conclusion by wang2024learning, which suggests that decreasing monosemanticity enhances model performance, does not hold when the model changes. Instead, we demonstrate that monosemanticity consistently exhibits a positive correlation with model capacity, in the preference alignment process. Consequently, we apply feature correlation as a proxy for monosemanticity and incorporate a feature decorrelation regularizer into the dynamic preference optimization process. The experiments show that our method not only enhances representation diversity and activation sparsity but also improves preference alignment performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Venditti, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Giancarlo A. Xompero, Cristina Giannone, Andrea Favalli, Raniero Romagnoli, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require a significant redesign in solutions to preserve privacy in data-intensive applications due to their text-generation capabilities. Indeed, LLMs tend to memorize and emit private information when maliciously prompted. In this paper, we introduce Private Association Editing (PAE) as a novel defense approach for private data leakage. PAE is designed to effectively remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without retraining the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE with respect to alternative baseline methods. We believe PAE will serve as a critical tool in the ongoing effort to protect data privacy in LLMs, encouraging the development of safer models for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaru Zou, Mengyu Zhou, Tao Li, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their usage in domain-specific tasks. Despite the success, fine-tuning continues to rely on repeated and lengthy prompts, which escalate computational expenses, require more resources, and lead to slower inference. In this paper, we present a novel approach, PromptIntern, which internalizes prompt knowledge during model fine-tuning to achieve efficient inference and save costs. Instead of compressing the prompts for a vanilla model, PromptIntern aims to embed the recurrent prompt directly into the model parameters. We design a fine-tuning pipeline that includes instruction template compression, few-shot example absorption, and a progressive internalization strategy, effectively diminishing the need for intricate prompts during inference. Comprehensive experiments on challenging NL2Code tasks demonstrate that our method reduces input tokens by more than 90%, accelerates inference by 4.2 times, and reduces monetary inference costs by 88.3%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangtao Sun, Chenxiang Zhang, XueYou Zhang, Xuanqing Yu, Ziyang Huang, Pei Chen, Haotian Xu, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong ability, they are further supposed to be controlled and guided by in real-world scenarios to be safe, accurate, and intelligent. This demands the possession of capability of LLMs. However, no prior work has made a clear evaluation of the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the inferential rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios. Therefore, this paper first clarifies the concept of inferential rule-following and proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified range of inferential rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a variety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our analysis based on the evaluation results provides insights into the improvements for LLMs toward a better inferential rule-following intelligent agent. We further propose Inferential Rule-Following Tuning (IRFT). The experimental results show that through IRFT, LLMs can learn abstract rule-following abilities from purely synthetic data and then generalize to RuleBench.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashkan Golgoon, Khashayar Filom, Arjun Ravi Kannan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models such as GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a broad spectrum of applications. Nevertheless, due to their intrinsic complexity, these models present substantial challenges in interpreting their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency poses critical challenges when it comes to their adaptation by financial institutions, where concerns and accountability regarding bias, fairness, and reliability are of paramount importance. Mechanistic interpretability aims at reverse engineering complex AI models such as transformers. In this paper, we are pioneering the use of mechanistic interpretability to shed some light on the inner workings of large language models for use in financial services applications. We offer several examples of how algorithmic tasks can be designed for compliance monitoring purposes. In particular, we investigate GPT-2 Small's attention pattern when prompted to identify potential violation of Fair Lending laws. Using direct logit attribution, we study the contributions of each layer and its corresponding attention heads to the logit difference in the residual stream. Finally, we design clean and corrupted prompts and use activation patching as a causal intervention method to localize our task completion components further. We observe that the (positive) heads $10.2$ (head $2$, layer $10$), $10.7$, and $11.3$, as well as the (negative) heads $9.6$ and $10.6$ play a significant role in the task completion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghoon Han, Eunhwan Park, Gisang Lee, Adam Lee, Nojun Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of multimedia content has made accurately retrieving relevant videos from large collections increasingly challenging. Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process. Experimental results on datasets like MSR-VTT, MSVD, and ActivityNet demonstrate that MERLIN substantially improves Recall@1, outperforming existing systems and confirming the benefits of integrating LLMs into multimodal retrieval systems for more responsive and context-aware multimedia retrieval.</p>

<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition in speech is a challenging multimodal task that requires understanding both verbal content and vocal nuances. This paper introduces a novel approach to emotion detection using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding. To overcome the inherent limitation of LLMs in processing audio inputs, we propose SpeechCueLLM, a method that translates speech characteristics into natural language descriptions, allowing LLMs to perform multimodal emotion analysis via text prompts without any architectural changes. Our method is minimal yet impactful, outperforming baseline models that require structural modifications. We evaluate SpeechCueLLM on two datasets: IEMOCAP and MELD, showing significant improvements in emotion recognition accuracy, particularly for high-quality audio data. We also explore the effectiveness of various feature representations and fine-tuning strategies for different LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating speech descriptions yields a more than 2% increase in the average weighted F1 score on IEMOCAP (from 70.111% to 72.596%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Xie, Qian Qiao, Jun Gao, Tianxiang Wu, Jiaqing Fan, Yue Zhang, Jielei Zhang, Huyang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: More and more end-to-end text spotting methods based on Transformer architecture have demonstrated superior performance. These methods utilize a bipartite graph matching algorithm to perform one-to-one optimal matching between predicted objects and actual objects. However, the instability of bipartite graph matching can lead to inconsistent optimization targets, thereby affecting the training performance of the model. Existing literature applies denoising training to solve the problem of bipartite graph matching instability in object detection tasks. Unfortunately, this denoising training method cannot be directly applied to text spotting tasks, as these tasks need to perform irregular shape detection tasks and more complex text recognition tasks than classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel denoising training method (DNTextSpotter) for arbitrary-shaped text spotting. Specifically, we decompose the queries of the denoising part into noised positional queries and noised content queries. We use the four Bezier control points of the Bezier center curve to generate the noised positional queries. For the noised content queries, considering that the output of the text in a fixed positional order is not conducive to aligning position with content, we employ a masked character sliding method to initialize noised content queries, thereby assisting in the alignment of text content and position. To improve the model's perception of the background, we further utilize an additional loss function for background characters classification in the denoising training part.Although DNTextSpotter is conceptually simple, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks (Total-Text, SCUT-CTW1500, ICDAR15, and Inverse-Text), especially yielding an improvement of 11.3% against the best approach in Inverse-Text dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vincent Jeanselme, Chang Ho Yoon, Fabian Falck, Brian Tom, Jessica Barrett</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying patient subgroups with different treatment responses is an important task to inform medical recommendations, guidelines, and the design of future clinical trials. Existing approaches for subgroup analysis primarily rely on Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), in which treatment assignment is randomised. RCTs' patient cohorts are often constrained by cost, rendering them not representative of the heterogeneity of patients likely to receive treatment in real-world clinical practice. When applied to observational studies, subgroup analysis approaches suffer from significant statistical biases particularly because of the non-randomisation of treatment. Our work introduces a novel, outcome-guided method for identifying treatment response subgroups in observational studies. Our approach assigns each patient to a subgroup associated with two time-to-event distributions: one under treatment and one under control regime. It hence positions itself in between individualised and average treatment effect estimation. The assumptions of our model result in a simple correction of the statistical bias from treatment non-randomisation through inverse propensity weighting. In experiments, our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method for outcome-guided subgroup analysis in both randomised and observational treatment regimes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samee Arif, Sualeha Farid, Abdul Hameed Azeemi, Awais Athar, Agha Ali Raza</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-agent workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the response generation module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in general translation tasks. However, the increasing demand for high-quality translations that are not only adequate but also fluent and elegant. To assess the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands, we introduce a suitable benchmark for translating classical Chinese poetry into English. This task requires not only adequacy in translating culturally and historically significant content but also a strict adherence to linguistic fluency and poetic elegance. Our study reveals that existing LLMs fall short of this task. To address these issues, we propose RAT, a \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented machine \textbf{T}ranslation method that enhances the translation process by incorporating knowledge related to classical poetry. Additionally, we propose an automatic evaluation metric based on GPT-4, which better assesses translation quality in terms of adequacy, fluency, and elegance, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics.

<p>Abstract: Recently, a diverse set of decoding and reranking procedures have been shown effective for LLM-based code generation. However, a comprehensive framework that links and experimentally compares these methods is missing. We address this by proposing Decoding Objectives for Code Execution, a comprehensive framework that includes candidate generation, $n$-best reranking, minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, and self-debugging as the core components. We then study the contributions of these components through execution-based evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of execution-based methods and the difference gap between execution-based and execution-free methods. Furthermore, we assess the impact of filtering based on trial unit tests, a simple and effective strategy that has been often overlooked in prior works. We also propose self-debugging on multiple candidates, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on reranking for code generation. We expect our framework to provide a solid guideline for future research on code generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fact-checking techniques can mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), a prominent issue in specialized domains. As parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can overcome substantial computational overhead, some studies have explored the integration of multiple LoRAs. While previous studies focus on parallel integration, this paper investigates methods to establish connections among multiple LoRAs. We create three reasoning datasets tailored to fact-checking and fine-tune individual LoRAs, allowing them to view and reason from diverse perspectives. Then, we explore strategies for allocating these reasoning LoRAs and introduce LoraMap, an approach to map connections between them. The results of the fact-checking task demonstrate that the performance of LoraMap is superior to LoraHub, an existing method for integrating LoRAs. LoraMap also outperforms with significantly fewer trainable parameters than LoraConcat, which concatenates LoRAs and further fine-tunes them.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data valuation seeks to answer the important question, "How much is this data worth?" Existing data valuation methods have largely focused on discriminative models, primarily examining data value through the lens of its utility in training. However, with the push for ever-larger language models, relying on valuation methods that require training becomes increasingly expensive and dependent on specific techniques. We propose an alternative perspective on the data value problem for language models, centering around the plausibility of the data. We posit that data holds lesser value if it can be plausibly generated by the model itself. Starting from some intuitive criteria that align with our notions of valuable data, we develop a novel value function that is computationally tractable and derived from first principles with provable properties. We conduct a theoretical analysis of our value function and evaluate it across multiple scenarios and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushal Kedia, Prithwish Dan, Angela Chao, Maximus Adrian Pace, Sanjiban Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Human demonstrations as prompts are a powerful way to program robots to do long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, translating these demonstrations into robot-executable actions presents significant challenges due to execution mismatches in movement styles and physical capabilities. Existing methods either depend on human-robot paired data, which is infeasible to scale, or rely heavily on frame-level visual similarities that often break down in practice. To address these challenges, we propose RHyME, a novel framework that automatically aligns human and robot task executions using optimal transport costs. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes semantically equivalent human videos by retrieving and composing short-horizon human clips. This approach facilitates effective policy training without the need for paired data. RHyME successfully imitates a range of cross-embodiment demonstrators, both in simulation and with a real human hand, achieving over 50\% increase in task success compared to previous methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeno Kujawa, John Poole, Dobrik Georgiev, Danilo Numeroso, Pietro Li\`o</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) aims to optimize classical algorithms. However, canonical implementations of NAR train neural networks to return only a single solution, even when there are multiple correct solutions to a problem, such as single-source shortest paths. For some applications, it is desirable to recover more than one correct solution. To that end, we give the first method for NAR with multiple solutions. We demonstrate our method on two classical algorithms: Bellman-Ford (BF) and Depth-First Search (DFS), favouring deeper insight into two algorithms over a broader survey of algorithms. This method involves generating appropriate training data as well as sampling and validating solutions from model output. Each step of our method, which can serve as a framework for neural algorithmic reasoning beyond the tasks presented in this paper, might be of independent interest to the field and our results represent the first attempt at this task in the NAR literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Lee, Ian Chuang, Ling-Yuan Chen, Iman Soltani</p>
<p>Abstract: Bimanual manipulation presents unique challenges compared to unimanual tasks due to the complexity of coordinating two robotic arms. In this paper, we introduce InterACT: Inter-dependency aware Action Chunking with Hierarchical Attention Transformers, a novel imitation learning framework designed specifically for bimanual manipulation. InterACT leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to effectively capture inter-dependencies between dual-arm joint states and visual inputs. The framework comprises a Hierarchical Attention Encoder, which processes multi-modal inputs through segment-wise and cross-segment attention mechanisms, and a Multi-arm Decoder that generates each arm's action predictions in parallel, while sharing information between the arms through synchronization blocks by providing the other arm's intermediate output as context. Our experiments, conducted on various simulated and real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrate that InterACT outperforms existing methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph machine learning (GML) has been successfully applied across a wide range of tasks. Nonetheless, GML faces significant challenges in generalizing over out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which raises concerns about its wider applicability. Recent advancements have underscored the crucial role of causality-driven approaches in overcoming these generalization challenges. Distinct from traditional GML methods that primarily rely on statistical dependencies, causality-focused strategies delve into the underlying causal mechanisms of data generation and model prediction, thus significantly improving the generalization of GML across different environments. This paper offers a thorough review of recent progress in causality-involved GML generalization. We elucidate the fundamental concepts of employing causality to enhance graph model generalization and categorize the various approaches, providing detailed descriptions of their methodologies and the connections among them. Furthermore, we explore the incorporation of causality in other related important areas of trustworthy GML, such as explanation, fairness, and robustness. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions, this review seeks to articulate the continuing development and future potential of causality in enhancing the trustworthiness of graph machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esteve Valls Mascaro, Dongheui Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As humanoid robots transition from labs to real-world environments, it is essential to democratize robot control for non-expert users. Recent human-robot imitation algorithms focus on following a reference human motion with high precision, but they are susceptible to the quality of the reference motion and require the human operator to simplify its movements to match the robot's capabilities. Instead, we consider that the robot should understand and adapt the reference motion to its own abilities, facilitating the operator's task. For that, we introduce a deep-learning model that anticipates the robot's performance when imitating a given reference. Then, our system can generate multiple references given a high-level task command, assign a score to each of them, and select the best reference to achieve the desired robot behavior. Our Self-AWare model (SAW) ranks potential robot behaviors based on various criteria, such as fall likelihood, adherence to the reference motion, and smoothness. We integrate advanced motion generation, robot control, and SAW in one unique system, ensuring optimal robot behavior for any task command. For instance, SAW can anticipate falls with 99.29% accuracy. For more information check our project page: https://evm7.github.io/Self-AWare</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiuqi Wang, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, abbreviated as linear TD, is a classic and powerful prediction algorithm in reinforcement learning. While it is well understood that linear TD converges almost surely to a unique point, this convergence traditionally requires the assumption that the features used by the approximator are linearly independent. However, this linear independence assumption does not hold in many practical scenarios. This work is the first to establish the almost sure convergence of linear TD without requiring linearly independent features. In fact, we do not make any assumptions on the features. We prove that the approximated value function converges to a unique point and the weight iterates converge to a set. We also establish a notion of local stability of the weight iterates. Importantly, we do not need to introduce any other additional assumptions and do not need to make any modification to the linear TD algorithm. Key to our analysis is a novel characterization of bounded invariant sets of the mean ODE of linear TD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mercy Nyamewaa Asiedu, Iskandar Haykel, Awa Dieng, Kerrie Kauer, Tousif Ahmed, Florence Ofori, Charisma Chan, Stephen Pfohl, Negar Rostamzadeh, Katherine Heller</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has the potential to significantly change and improve healthcare. However in most African countries, identifying culturally and contextually attuned approaches for deploying these solutions is not well understood. To bridge this gap, we conduct a qualitative study to investigate the best practices, fairness indicators, and potential biases to mitigate when deploying AI for health in African countries, as well as explore opportunities where artificial intelligence could make a positive impact in health. We used a mixed methods approach combining in-depth interviews (IDIs) and surveys. We conduct 1.5-2 hour long IDIs with 50 experts in health, policy, and AI across 17 countries, and through an inductive approach we conduct a qualitative thematic analysis on expert IDI responses. We administer a blinded 30-minute survey with case studies to 672 general population participants across 5 countries in Africa and analyze responses on quantitative scales, statistically comparing responses by country, age, gender, and level of familiarity with AI. We thematically summarize open-ended responses from surveys. Our results find generally positive attitudes, high levels of trust, accompanied by moderate levels of concern among general population participants for AI usage for health in Africa. This contrasts with expert responses, where major themes revolved around trust/mistrust, ethical concerns, and systemic barriers to integration, among others. This work presents the first-of-its-kind qualitative research study of the potential of AI for health in Africa from an algorithmic fairness angle, with perspectives from both experts and the general population. We hope that this work guides policymakers and drives home the need for further research and the inclusion of general population perspectives in decision-making around AI usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexis Vieloszynski, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Jean-Fr\'ed\'eric Laprade, Oliver Nahman-L\'evesque, Abdallah Aaraba, Shengrui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning consists in taking advantage of quantum computations to generate classical data. A potential application of quantum machine learning is to harness the power of quantum computers for generating classical data, a process essential to a multitude of applications such as enriching training datasets, anomaly detection, and risk management in finance. Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in classical image generation, the development of its quantum versions has been actively conducted. However, existing implementations on quantum computers often face significant challenges, such as scalability and training convergence issues. To address these issues, we propose LatentQGAN, a novel quantum model that uses a hybrid quantum-classical GAN coupled with an autoencoder. Although it was initially designed for image generation, the LatentQGAN approach holds potential for broader application across various practical data generation tasks. Experimental outcomes on both classical simulators and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers have demonstrated significant performance enhancements over existing quantum methods, alongside a significant reduction in quantum resources overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzi Yan, Xingzhou Lou, Jialian Li, Yiping Zhang, Jian Xie, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Dong Yan, Yuan Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sikai Yang, Gang Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Losing track of reading progress during line switching can be frustrating. Eye gaze tracking technology offers a potential solution by highlighting read paragraphs, aiding users in avoiding wrong line switches. However, the gap between gaze tracking accuracy (2-3 cm) and text line spacing (3-5 mm) makes direct application impractical. Existing methods leverage the linear reading pattern but fail during jump reading. This paper presents a reading tracking and highlighting system that supports both linear and jump reading. Based on experimental insights from the gaze nature study of 16 users, two gaze error models are designed to enable both jump reading detection and relocation. The system further leverages the large language model's contextual perception capability in aiding reading tracking. A reading tracking domain-specific line-gaze alignment opportunity is also exploited to enable dynamic and frequent calibration of the gaze results. Controlled experiments demonstrate reliable linear reading tracking, as well as 84% accuracy in tracking jump reading. Furthermore, real field tests with 18 volunteers demonstrated the system's effectiveness in tracking and highlighting read paragraphs, improving reading efficiency, and enhancing user experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohaifa Khaldi, Domingo Alcaraz-Segura, Ignacio S\'anchez-Herrera, Javier Martinez-Lopez, Carlos Javier Navarro, Siham Tabik</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media images have proven to be a valuable source of information for understanding human interactions with important subjects such as cultural heritage, biodiversity, and nature, among others. The task of grouping such images into a number of semantically meaningful clusters without labels is challenging due to the high diversity and complex nature of the visual content in addition to their large volume. On the other hand, recent advances in Large Visual Models (LVMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) provide an important opportunity to explore new productive and scalable solutions. This work proposes, analyzes, and compares various approaches based on one or more state-of-the-art LVM, LLM, and LVLM, for mapping social media images into a number of predefined classes. As a case study, we consider the problem of understanding the interactions between humans and nature, also known as Nature's Contribution to People or Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). Our experiments show that the highest-performing approaches, with accuracy above 95%, still require the creation of a small labeled dataset. These include the fine-tuned LVM DINOv2 and the LVLM LLaVA-1.5 combined with a fine-tuned LLM. The top fully unsupervised approaches, achieving accuracy above 84%, are the LVLMs, specifically the proprietary GPT-4 model and the public LLaVA-1.5 model. Additionally, the LVM DINOv2, when applied in a 10-shot learning setup, delivered competitive results with an accuracy of 83.99%, closely matching the performance of the LVLM LLaVA-1.5.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Pan, Rongyu Cao, Yongchang Cao, Yingwei Ma, Binhua Li, Fei Huang, Han Liu, Yongbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code completion, a key downstream task in code generation, is one of the most frequent and impactful methods for enhancing developer productivity in software development. As intelligent completion tools evolve, we need a robust evaluation benchmark that enables meaningful comparisons between products and guides future advancements. However, existing benchmarks focus more on coarse-grained tasks without industrial analysis resembling general code generation rather than the real-world scenarios developers encounter. Moreover, these benchmarks often rely on costly and time-consuming human annotation, and the standalone test cases fail to leverage minimal tests for maximum repository-level understanding and code coverage. To address these limitations, we first analyze business data from an industrial code completion tool and redefine the evaluation criteria to better align with the developer's intent and desired completion behavior throughout the coding process. Based on these insights, we introduce Codev-Agent, an agent-based system that automates repository crawling, constructs execution environments, extracts dynamic calling chains from existing unit tests, and generates new test samples to avoid data leakage, ensuring fair and effective comparisons. Using Codev-Agent, we present the Code-Development Benchmark (Codev-Bench), a fine-grained, real-world, repository-level, and developer-centric evaluation framework. Codev-Bench assesses whether a code completion tool can capture a developer's immediate intent and suggest appropriate code across diverse contexts, providing a more realistic benchmark for code completion in modern software development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nirmalya Thakur</p>
<p>Abstract: The work presented in this paper makes three scientific contributions with a specific focus on mining and analysis of COVID-19-related posts on Instagram. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 500,153 Instagram posts about COVID-19 published between January 2020 and September 2024. This dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in 161 different languages as well as 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the development of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed, which involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this dataset. Second, it presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per year from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related to COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, between 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive sentiment decreasing from 38.35% to 28.69%, while neutral sentiment rising from 44.19% to 58.34%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of language-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and contrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages on Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68% were positive, 14.84% were negative, and 35.48% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts, 4.40% were positive, 57.04% were negative, and 38.56% were neutral, reflecting distinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuochun Li, Yuelyu Ji, Rui Meng, Daqing He</p>
<p>Abstract: While reasoning capabilities typically emerge in large language models (LLMs) with tens of billions of parameters, recent research focuses on improving smaller open-source models through knowledge distillation (KD) from commercial LLMs. However, many of these studies rely solely on responses from a single LLM as the gold rationale, unlike the natural human learning process, which involves understanding both the correct answers and the reasons behind mistakes. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fault-Aware Distillation via Peer-Review (FAIR) approach: 1) Instead of merely obtaining gold rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student's mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data. 2) We design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, which selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold. This reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruizhe Chen, Xiaotian Zhang, Meng Luo, Wenhao Chai, Zuozhu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning with personalized preferences, which vary significantly across cultural, educational, and political differences, poses a significant challenge due to the computational costs and data demands of traditional alignment methods. In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized LLM alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision models excel in image classification but struggle to generalize to unseen data, such as classifying images from unseen domains or discovering novel categories. In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> F{\i}rat \"Oncel, Matthias Bethge, Beyza Ermis, Mirco Ravanelli, Cem Subakan, \c{C}a\u{g}atay Y{\i}ld{\i}z</p>
<p>Abstract: In the last decade, the generalization and adaptation abilities of deep learning models were typically evaluated on fixed training and test distributions. Contrary to traditional deep learning, large language models (LLMs) are (i) even more overparameterized, (ii) trained on unlabeled text corpora curated from the Internet with minimal human intervention, and (iii) trained in an online fashion. These stark contrasts prevent researchers from transferring lessons learned on model generalization and adaptation in deep learning contexts to LLMs. To this end, our short paper introduces empirical observations that aim to shed light on further training of already pretrained language models. Specifically, we demonstrate that training a model on a text domain could degrade its perplexity on the test portion of the same domain. We observe with our subsequent analysis that the performance degradation is positively correlated with the similarity between the additional and the original pretraining dataset of the LLM. Our further token-level perplexity observations reveals that the perplexity degradation is due to a handful of tokens that are not informative about the domain. We hope these findings will guide us in determining when to adapt a model vs when to rely on its foundational capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanitarian organizations can enhance their effectiveness by analyzing data to discover trends, gather aggregated insights, manage their security risks, support decision-making, and inform advocacy and funding proposals. However, data about violent incidents with direct impact and relevance for humanitarian aid operations is not readily available. An automatic data collection and NLP-backed classification framework aligned with humanitarian perspectives can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we present HumVI - a dataset comprising news articles in three languages (English, French, Arabic) containing instances of different types of violent incidents categorized by the humanitarian sector they impact, e.g., aid security, education, food security, health, and protection. Reliable labels were obtained for the dataset by partnering with a data-backed humanitarian organization, Insecurity Insight. We provide multiple benchmarks for the dataset, employing various deep learning architectures and techniques, including data augmentation and mask loss, to address different task-related challenges, e.g., domain expansion.

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback significantly enhances Natural Language Processing by aligning language models with human expectations. A critical factor in this alignment is the strength of reward models used during training. This study explores whether stronger reward models invariably lead to better language models. In this paper, through experiments on relevance, factuality, and completeness tasks using the QA-FEEDBACK dataset and reward models based on Longformer, we uncover a surprising paradox: language models trained with moderately accurate reward models outperform those guided by highly accurate ones. This challenges the widely held belief that stronger reward models always lead to better language models, and opens up new avenues for future research into the key factors driving model performance and how to choose the most suitable reward models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gian Maria Campedelli, Nicol\`o Penzo, Massimo Stefan, Roberto Dess\`i, Marco Guerini, Bruno Lepri, Jacopo Staiano</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gleb Kuzmin, Petr Strepetov, Maksim Stankevich, Artem Shelmanov, Ivan Smirnov</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper compares the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods, encoder-based models, and large language models (LLMs) on the task of detecting depression and anxiety. Five datasets were considered, each differing in format and the method used to define the target pathology class. We tested AutoML models based on linguistic features, several variations of encoder-based Transformers such as BERT, and state-of-the-art LLMs as pathology classification models. The results demonstrated that LLMs outperform traditional methods, particularly on noisy and small datasets where training examples vary significantly in text length and genre. However, psycholinguistic features and encoder-based models can achieve performance comparable to language models when trained on texts from individuals with clinically confirmed depression, highlighting their potential effectiveness in targeted clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Min, Zeyu Qin, Nevin L. Zhang, Li Shen, Minhao Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as they allow attackers to manipulate model predictions with backdoor triggers. To address these security vulnerabilities, various backdoor purification methods have been proposed to purify compromised models. Typically, these purified models exhibit low Attack Success Rates (ASR), rendering them resistant to backdoored inputs. However, Does achieving a low ASR through current safety purification methods truly eliminate learned backdoor features from the pretraining phase? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by thoroughly investigating the Post-Purification Robustness of current backdoor purification methods. We find that current safety purification methods are vulnerable to the rapid re-learning of backdoor behavior, even when further fine-tuning of purified models is performed using a very small number of poisoned samples. Based on this, we further propose the practical Query-based Reactivation Attack (QRA) which could effectively reactivate the backdoor by merely querying purified models. We find the failure to achieve satisfactory post-purification robustness stems from the insufficient deviation of purified models from the backdoored model along the backdoor-connected path. To improve the post-purification robustness, we propose a straightforward tuning defense, Path-Aware Minimization (PAM), which promotes deviation along backdoor-connected paths with extra model updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAM significantly improves post-purification robustness while maintaining a good clean accuracy and low ASR. Our work provides a new perspective on understanding the effectiveness of backdoor safety tuning and highlights the importance of faithfully assessing the model's safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junkang Wu, Xue Wang, Zhengyi Yang, Jiancan Wu, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Xiang Wang, Rong Jin, Xiangnan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions is crucial for their utility, honesty, and safety. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach to achieve this alignment, but it faces challenges in computational efficiency and training stability. Recent methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) have proposed offline alternatives to RLHF, simplifying the process by reparameterizing the reward function. However, DPO depends on a potentially suboptimal reference model, and SimPO's assumption of a fixed target reward margin may lead to suboptimal decisions in diverse data settings. In this work, we propose $\alpha$-DPO, an adaptive preference optimization algorithm designed to address these limitations by introducing a dynamic reward margin. Specifically, $\alpha$-DPO employs an adaptive preference distribution, balancing the policy model and the reference model to achieve personalized reward margins. We provide theoretical guarantees for $\alpha$-DPO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate optimization objective and its ability to balance alignment and diversity through KL divergence control. Empirical evaluations on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that $\alpha$-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and SimPO across various model settings, establishing it as a robust approach for fine-tuning LLMs. Our method achieves significant improvements in win rates, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for LLM alignment.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10394">PIVOT-R: Primitive-Driven Waypoint-Aware World Model for Robotic Manipulation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaidong Zhang, Pengzhen Ren, Bingqian Lin, Junfan Lin, Shikui Ma, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-guided robotic manipulation is a challenging task that requires an embodied agent to follow abstract user instructions to accomplish various complex manipulation tasks. Previous work trivially fitting the data without revealing the relation between instruction and low-level executable actions, these models are prone to memorizing the surficial pattern of the data instead of acquiring the transferable knowledge, and thus are fragile to dynamic environment changes. To address this issue, we propose a PrIrmitive-driVen waypOinT-aware world model for Robotic manipulation (PIVOT-R) that focuses solely on the prediction of task-relevant waypoints. Specifically, PIVOT-R consists of a Waypoint-aware World Model (WAWM) and a lightweight action prediction module. The former performs primitive action parsing and primitive-driven waypoint prediction, while the latter focuses on decoding low-level actions. Additionally, we also design an asynchronous hierarchical executor (AHE), which can use different execution frequencies for different modules of the model, thereby helping the model reduce computational redundancy and improve model execution efficiency. Our PIVOT-R outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) open-source models on the SeaWave benchmark, achieving an average relative improvement of 19.45% across four levels of instruction tasks. Moreover, compared to the synchronously executed PIVOT-R, the execution efficiency of PIVOT-R with AHE is increased by 28-fold, with only a 2.9% drop in performance. These results provide compelling evidence that our PIVOT-R can significantly improve both the performance and efficiency of robotic manipulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Han, Jianyuan Guo, Yehui Tang, Wei He, Enhua Wu, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language large models have achieved remarkable success in various multi-modal tasks, yet applying them to video understanding remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and computational demands of video data. While training-based video-LLMs deliver high performance, they often require substantial resources for training and inference. Conversely, training-free approaches offer a more efficient alternative by adapting pre-trained image-LLMs models for video tasks without additional training, but they face inference efficiency bottlenecks due to the large number of visual tokens generated from video frames. In this work, we present a novel prompt-guided visual perception framework (abbreviated as Free Video-LLM) for efficient inference of training-free video LLMs. The proposed framework decouples spatial-temporal dimension and performs temporal frame sampling and spatial RoI cropping respectively based on task-specific prompts. Our method effectively reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining high performance across multiple video question-answering benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results with significantly fewer tokens, offering an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/contrastive/FreeVideoLLM.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10714">SeedLM: Compressing LLM Weights into Seeds of Pseudo-Random Generators</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rasoul Shafipour, David Harrison, Maxwell Horton, Jeffrey Marker, Houman Bedayat, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Mahyar Najibi, Saman Naderiparizi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, but face significant challenges in widespread deployment due to their high runtime cost. In this paper, we introduce SeedLM, a novel post-training compression method that uses seeds of pseudo-random generators to encode and compress model weights. Specifically, for each block of weights, we find a seed that is fed into a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) during inference to efficiently generate a random matrix. This matrix is then linearly combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct the weight block. SeedLM reduces memory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory accesses. Unlike state-of-the-art compression methods that rely on calibration data, our approach is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Our experiments with Llama 3 70B, which is particularly challenging to compress, show that SeedLM achieves significantly better zero-shot accuracy retention at 4- and 3-bit than state-of-the-art techniques, while maintaining performance comparable to FP16 baselines. Additionally, FPGA-based tests demonstrate that 4-bit SeedLM, as model size increases to 70B, approaches a 4x speed-up over an FP16 Llama 2/3 baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Efimia Panagiotaki, Daniele De Martini, Lars Kunze, Petar Veli\v{c}kovi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: This study explores the intersection of neural networks and classical robotics algorithms through the Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) framework, allowing to train neural networks to effectively reason like classical robotics algorithms by learning to execute them. Algorithms are integral to robotics and safety-critical applications due to their predictable and consistent performance through logical and mathematical principles. In contrast, while neural networks are highly adaptable, handling complex, high-dimensional data and generalising across tasks, they often lack interpretability and transparency in their internal computations. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based learning framework, NAR-*ICP, which learns the intermediate algorithmic steps of classical ICP-based pointcloud registration algorithms, and extend the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark with classical robotics perception algorithms. We evaluate our approach across diverse datasets, from real-world to synthetic, demonstrating its flexibility in handling complex and noisy inputs, along with its potential to be used as part of a larger learning system. Our results indicate that our method achieves superior performance across all benchmarks and datasets, consistently surpassing even the algorithms it has been trained on, further demonstrating its ability to generalise beyond the capabilities of traditional algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhifei Xie, Changqiao Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: GPT-4o, an all-encompassing model, represents a milestone in the development of large multi-modal language models. It can understand visual, auditory, and textual modalities, directly output audio, and support flexible duplex interaction. Models from the open-source community often achieve some functionalities of GPT-4o, such as visual understanding and voice chat. Nevertheless, training a unified model that incorporates all modalities is challenging due to the complexities of multi-modal data, intricate model architectures, and training processes. In this paper, we introduce Mini-Omni2, a visual-audio assistant capable of providing real-time, end-to-end voice responses to visoin and audio queries. By integrating pretrained visual and auditory encoders, Mini-Omni2 maintains performance in individual modalities. We propose a three-stage training process to align modalities, allowing the language model to handle multi-modal inputs and outputs after training on a limited dataset. For interaction, we introduce a command-based interruption mechanism, enabling more flexible interaction with users. To the best of our knowledge, Mini-Omni2 is one of the closest reproductions of GPT-4o, which have similar form of functionality, and we hope it can offer valuable insights for subsequent research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinpeng Wang, Xiaoying Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to train models that can effectively generalize to unseen domains. However, in the context of Federated Learning (FL), where clients collaboratively train a model without directly sharing their data, most existing DG algorithms are not directly applicable to the FL setting due to privacy constraints, as well as the limited data quantity and domain diversity at each client. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCCRL, a novel federated domain generalization method that significantly improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen domains without compromising privacy or incurring excessive computational and communication costs. Specifically, we adapt MixStyle to the federated setting to transfer domain-specific features while AugMix is employed to perturb domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we leverage supervised contrastive loss for representation alignment and utilize Jensen-Shannon divergence to ensure consistent predictions between original and augmented samples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedCCRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances on the PACS, OfficeHome and miniDomainNet datasets across varying numbers of clients.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lev Sorokin, Damir Safin, Shiva Nejati</p>
<p>Abstract: Search-based software testing (SBST) is a widely adopted technique for testing complex systems with large input spaces, such as Deep Learning-enabled (DL-enabled) systems. Many SBST techniques focus on Pareto-based optimization, where multiple objectives are optimized in parallel to reveal failures. However, it is important to ensure that identified failures are spread throughout the entire failure-inducing area of a search domain and not clustered in a sub-region. This ensures that identified failures are semantically diverse and reveal a wide range of underlying causes. In this paper, we present a theoretical argument explaining why testing based on Pareto optimization is inadequate for covering failure-inducing areas within a search domain. We support our argument with empirical results obtained by applying two widely used types of Pareto-based optimization techniques, namely NSGA-II (an evolutionary algorithm) and OMOPSO (a swarm-based Pareto-optimization algorithm), to two DL-enabled systems: an industrial Automated Valet Parking (AVP) system and a system for classifying handwritten digits. We measure the coverage of failure-revealing test inputs in the input space using a metric that we refer to as the Coverage Inverted Distance quality indicator. Our results show that NSGA-II-based search and OMOPSO are not more effective than a na\"ive random search baseline in covering test inputs that reveal failures. The replication package for this study is available in a GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning combined with sim-to-real transfer offers a general framework for developing locomotion controllers for legged robots. To facilitate successful deployment in the real world, smoothing techniques, such as low-pass filters and smoothness rewards, are often employed to develop policies with smooth behaviors. However, because these techniques are non-differentiable and usually require tedious tuning of a large set of hyperparameters, they tend to require extensive manual tuning for each robotic platform. To address this challenge and establish a general technique for enforcing smooth behaviors, we propose a simple and effective method that imposes a Lipschitz constraint on a learned policy, which we refer to as Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP). We show that the Lipschitz constraint can be implemented in the form of a gradient penalty, which provides a differentiable objective that can be easily incorporated with automatic differentiation frameworks. We demonstrate that LCP effectively replaces the need for smoothing rewards or low-pass filters and can be easily integrated into training frameworks for many distinct humanoid robots. We extensively evaluate LCP in both simulation and real-world humanoid robots, producing smooth and robust locomotion controllers. All simulation and deployment code, along with complete checkpoints, is available on our project page: https://lipschitz-constrained-policy.github.io.</p>
