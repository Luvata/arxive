<p><b>Authors:</b> Qihang Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Metro crew planning is a key component of smart city development as it directly impacts the operational efficiency and service reliability of public transportation. With the rapid expansion of metro networks, effective multi-line scheduling and emergency management have become essential for large-scale seamless operations. However, current research focuses primarily on individual metro lines,with insufficient attention on cross-line coordination and rapid replanning during disruptions. Here, a unified optimization framework is presented for multi-line metro crew planning and replanning with heterogeneous workforce. Specifically, a hierarchical time-space network model is proposed to represent the unified crew action space, and computationally efficient constraints and formulations are derived for the crew's heterogeneous qualifications and preferences. Solution algorithms based on column generation and shortest path adjustment are further developed, utilizing the proposed network model. Experiments with real data from Shanghai and Beijing Metro demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform benchmark heuristics in both cost reduction and task completion,and achieve notable efficiency gains by incorporating cross-line operations, particularly for urgent tasks during disruptions. This work highlights the role of global optimization and cross-line coordination in multi-line metro system operations, providing insights into the efficient and reliable functioning of public transportation in smart cities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lanxiao Huang, Daksh Dave, Ming Jin, Tyler Cody, Peter Beling</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM), Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support, respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery, and (v) real-time dynamic responsiveness. Our results show that while some architectures natively exhibit subsets of these properties, targeted augmentations substantially improve modular agent performance, especially in complex, multi-step, and real-time penetration testing tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel R\"oder, Akhil Juneja, Roland Roller, Sven Schmeier</p>
<p>Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can autonomously perform complex, multistep tasks in dynamic web environments. However, current evaluations mostly focus on the overall success while overlooking intermediate errors. This limits insight into failure modes and hinders systematic improvement. This work analyzes existing benchmarks and highlights the lack of fine-grained diagnostic tools. To address this gap, we propose a modular evaluation framework that decomposes agent pipelines into interpretable stages for detailed error analysis. Using the SeeAct framework and the Mind2Web dataset as a case study, we show how this approach reveals actionable weaknesses missed by standard metrics - paving the way for more robust and generalizable web agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rick Chen, Joseph Ternasky, Afriyie Samuel Kwesi, Ben Griffin, Aaron Ontoyin Yin, Zakari Salifu, Kelvin Amoaba, Xianling Mu, Fuat Alican, Yigit Ihlamur</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarks such as SWE-bench and ARC-AGI demonstrate how shared datasets accelerate progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We introduce VCBench, the first benchmark for predicting founder success in venture capital (VC), a domain where signals are sparse, outcomes are uncertain, and even top investors perform modestly. At inception, the market index achieves a precision of 1.9%. Y Combinator outperforms the index by a factor of 1.7x, while tier-1 firms are 2.9x better. VCBench provides 9,000 anonymized founder profiles, standardized to preserve predictive features while resisting identity leakage, with adversarial tests showing more than 90% reduction in re-identification risk. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). DeepSeek-V3 delivers over six times the baseline precision, GPT-4o achieves the highest F0.5, and most models surpass human benchmarks. Designed as a public and evolving resource available at vcbench.com, VCBench establishes a community-driven standard for reproducible and privacy-preserving evaluation of AGI in early-stage venture forecasting.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14474">From Mimicry to True Intelligence (TI) - A New Paradigm for Artificial General Intelligence</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Meltem Subasioglu, Nevzat Subasioglu</p>
<p>Abstract: The debate around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains open due to two fundamentally different goals: replicating human-like performance versus replicating human-like cognitive processes. We argue that current performance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear, mechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the qualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human brain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to the development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True Intelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied sensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a highly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and lastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize results in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical, five-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable components a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with developmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building genuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5 AGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it and TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and given theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated, higher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and practically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from analytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures and latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based definition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research community.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14485">Beyond the high score: Prosocial ability profiles of multi-agent populations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Marko Tesic, Yue Zhao, Joel Z. Leibo, Rakshit S. Trivedi, Jose Hernandez-Orallo</p>
<p>Abstract: The development and evaluation of social capabilities in AI agents require complex environments where competitive and cooperative behaviours naturally emerge. While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent populations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention following, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The Melting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability profiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with better performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that top-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in scenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings, together with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution tailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing team may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary, potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose future research directions to account for biases introduced by different testing environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer both strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more transparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex social settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14507">DeKeyNLU: Enhancing Natural Language to SQL Generation through Task Decomposition and Keyword Extraction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Chen, Zhenyan Chen, Xuming Hu, Peilin Zhou, Yining Hua, Han Fang, Cissy Hing Yee Choy, Xinmei Ke, Jingfeng Luo, Zixuan Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance. However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500 meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14546">Rationality Check! Benchmarking the Rationality of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhilun Zhou, Jing Yi Wang, Nicholas Sukiennik, Chen Gao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li, James Evans</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), a recent advance in deep learning and machine intelligence, have manifested astonishing capacities, now considered among the most promising for artificial general intelligence. With human-like capabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants across many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether and under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents. Rationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior, both in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e., practical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains and LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental results, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from idealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a foundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14547">(P)rior(D)yna(F)low: A Priori Dynamic Workflow Construction via Multi-Agent Collaboration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Lin, Lujin Zhao, Yijie Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that carefully designed workflows coordinating large language models(LLMs) significantly enhance task-solving capabilities compared to using a single model. While an increasing number of works focus on autonomous workflow construction, most existing approaches rely solely on historical experience, leading to limitations in efficiency and adaptability. We argue that while historical experience is valuable, workflow construction should also flexibly respond to the unique characteristics of each task. To this end, we propose an a priori dynamic framework for automated workflow construction. Our framework first leverages Q-table learning to optimize the decision space, guiding agent decisions and enabling effective use of historical experience. At the same time, agents evaluate the current task progress and make a priori decisions regarding the next executing agent, allowing the system to proactively select the more suitable workflow structure for each given task. Additionally, we incorporate mechanisms such as cold-start initialization, early stopping, and pruning to further improve system efficiency. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.05%, while reducing workflow construction and inference costs to only 30.68%-48.31% of those required by existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidan Sun, Viktor Schlegel, Srinivasan Nandakumar, Iqra Zahid, Yuping Wu, Yulong Wu, Hao Li, Jie Zhang, Warren Del-Pinto, Goran Nenadic, Siew Kei Lam, Anil Anthony Bharath</p>
<p>Abstract: Data-driven decision support in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance faces significant barriers to data sharing due to regulatory, institutional, and privacy concerns. While recent generative AI models, such as large language models, have shown impressive performance in open-domain tasks, their adoption in sensitive environments remains limited by unpredictable behaviors and insufficient privacy-preserving datasets for benchmarking. Existing anonymization methods are often inadequate, especially for unstructured text, as redaction and masking can still allow re-identification. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled alternative, enabling the generation of synthetic data with formal privacy assurances. In this work, we address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework with standardized utility and fidelity metrics, encompassing nine curated datasets that capture domain-specific complexities such as technical jargon, long-context dependencies, and specialized document structures. Second, we conduct a large-scale empirical study benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs of varying sizes and different fine-tuning strategies, revealing that high-quality domain-specific synthetic data generation under DP constraints remains an unsolved challenge, with performance degrading as domain complexity increases. Third, we develop a membership inference attack (MIA) methodology tailored for synthetic text, providing first empirical evidence that the use of public datasets - potentially present in pre-training corpora - can invalidate claimed privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rigorous privacy auditing and highlight persistent gaps between open-domain and specialist evaluations, informing responsible deployment of generative AI in privacy-sensitive, high-stakes settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> NVJK Kartik, Garvit Sapra, Rishav Hada, Nikhil Pareek</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating complex, multi-agent workflows, organizations face mounting risks from errors, emergent behaviors, and systemic failures that current evaluation methods fail to capture. We present AgentCompass, the first evaluation framework designed specifically for post-deployment monitoring and debugging of agentic workflows. AgentCompass models the reasoning process of expert debuggers through a structured, multi-stage analytical pipeline: error identification and categorization, thematic clustering, quantitative scoring, and strategic summarization. The framework is further enhanced with a dual memory system-episodic and semantic-that enables continual learning across executions. Through collaborations with design partners, we demonstrate the framework's practical utility on real-world deployments, before establishing its efficacy against the publicly available TRAIL benchmark. AgentCompass achieves state-of-the-art results on key metrics, while uncovering critical issues missed in human annotations, underscoring its role as a robust, developer-centric tool for reliable monitoring and improvement of agentic systems in production.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Nan Zhang, Chenrui Fan, Hong Jiao, Yanbin Fu, Sydney Peters, Qingshu Xu, Robert Lissitz, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought reasoning, we lack a principled framework for understanding how these thoughts are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human mathematical problem-solving, to analyze the reasoning traces of LRMs. We annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify). The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Song Xu, Yilun Liu, Minggui He, Mingchen Dai, Ziang Chen, Chunguang Zhao, Jingzhou Du, Shimin Tao, Weibin Meng, Shenglin Zhang, Yongqian Sun, Boxing Chen, Daimeng Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Logs constitute a form of evidence signaling the operational status of software systems. Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally, RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step analytical outputs. We have released the corresponding resources, including code and datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masaharu Mizumoto, Dat Nguyen, Zhiheng Han, Jiyuan Fang, Heyuan Guan, Xingfu Li, Naoya Shiraishi, Xuyang Tian, Yo Nakawake, Le Minh Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmark saturation and contamination undermine confidence in LLM evaluation. We present Nazonazo, a cost-effective and extensible benchmark built from Japanese children's riddles to test insight-based reasoning. Items are short (mostly one sentence), require no specialized domain knowledge, and can be generated at scale, enabling rapid refresh of blind sets when leakage is suspected. We evaluate 38 frontier models and 126 adults on 120 riddles. No model except for GPT-5 is comparable to human performance, which achieves a 52.9% mean accuracy. Model comparison on extended 201 items shows that reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning peers, while model size shows no reliable association with accuracy. Beyond aggregate accuracy, an informal candidate-tracking analysis of thought logs reveals many cases of verification failure: models often produce the correct solution among intermediate candidates yet fail to select it as the final answer, which we illustrate with representative examples observed in multiple models. Nazonazo thus offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easily renewable benchmark format that addresses the current evaluation crisis while also suggesting a recurrent meta-cognitive weakness, providing clear targets for future control and calibration methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for domain-specific LLMs, yet it is often plagued by "Retrieval Hallucinations"--a phenomenon where fine-tuned models fail to recognize and act upon poor-quality retrieved documents, thus undermining performance. To address this, we propose the Adversarial Collaboration RAG (AC-RAG) framework. AC-RAG employs two heterogeneous agents: a generalist Detector that identifies knowledge gaps, and a domain-specialized Resolver that provides precise solutions. Guided by a moderator, these agents engage in an adversarial collaboration, where the Detector's persistent questioning challenges the Resolver's expertise. This dynamic process allows for iterative problem dissection and refined knowledge retrieval. Extensive experiments show that AC-RAG significantly improves retrieval accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art RAG methods across various vertical domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Health informatics research is characterized by diverse data modalities, rapid knowledge expansion, and the need to integrate insights across biomedical science, data analytics, and clinical practice. These characteristics make it particularly well-suited for agent-based approaches that can automate knowledge exploration, manage complex workflows, and generate clinically meaningful outputs. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising capabilities in literature synthesis, data analysis, and even end-to-end research execution. However, existing systems remain limited for health informatics because they lack mechanisms to interpret medical visualizations and often overlook domain-specific quality requirements. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenLens AI, a fully automated framework tailored to health informatics. OpenLens AI integrates specialized agents for literature review, data analysis, code generation, and manuscript preparation, enhanced by vision-language feedback for medical visualization and quality control for reproducibility. The framework automates the entire research pipeline, producing publication-ready LaTeX manuscripts with transparent and traceable workflows, thereby offering a domain-adapted solution for advancing health informatics research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriace poses a critical concern for infection prevention and control in hospitals. However, predictive modeling of previously highlighted CPE-associated risks such as readmission, mortality, and extended length of stay (LOS) remains underexplored, particularly with modern deep learning approaches. This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling framework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical Records data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an Irish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient demographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several Transformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine learning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were applied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated the utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently outperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially for CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related features, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and network centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient outcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that features like "Area of Residence", "Admission Ward" and prior admissions are key risk factors. Network variables like "Ward PageRank" also ranked highly, reflecting the potential value of structural exposure information. This study presents a robust and explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data to identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes. Our findings underscore the superior performance of the Transformer models and highlight the importance of diverse clinical and network features.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diego Gosmar, Deborah A. Dahl</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents, and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution over time.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present functions that quantify the contribution of a set of arguments in quantitative bipolar argumentation graphs to (the final strength of) an argument of interest, a so-called topic. Our set contribution functions are generalizations of existing functions that quantify the contribution of a single contributing argument to a topic. Accordingly, we generalize existing contribution function principles for set contribution functions and provide a corresponding principle-based analysis. We introduce new principles specific to set-based functions that focus on properties pertaining to the interaction of arguments within a set. Finally, we sketch how the principles play out across different set contribution functions given a recommendation system application scenario.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wu, Ting-Zhu Huang, Liang-Jian Deng, Yanyuan Qiao, Imran Razzak, Yutong Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams. Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations, we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty expertise.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriela C. Zapata, Bill Cope, Mary Kalantzis, Duane Searsmith</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates the use of generative AI to support formative assessment through machine generated reviews of peer reviews in graduate online courses in a public university in the United States. Drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistics and Appraisal Theory, we analyzed 120 metareviews to explore how generative AI feedback constructs meaning across ideational, interpersonal, and textual dimensions. The findings suggest that generative AI can approximate key rhetorical and relational features of effective human feedback, offering directive clarity while also maintaining a supportive stance. The reviews analyzed demonstrated a balance of praise and constructive critique, alignment with rubric expectations, and structured staging that foregrounded student agency. By modeling these qualities, AI metafeedback has the potential to scaffold feedback literacy and enhance leaner engagement with peer review.</p>

<p>Abstract: As autonomous technologies increasingly shape maritime operations, understanding why an AI system makes a decision becomes as crucial as what it decides. In complex and dynamic maritime environments, trust in AI depends not only on performance but also on transparency and interpretability. This paper highlights the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) as a foundation for effective human-machine teaming in the maritime domain, where informed oversight and shared understanding are essential. To support the user-centered integration of XAI, we propose a domain-specific survey designed to capture maritime professionals' perceptions of trust, usability, and explainability. Our aim is to foster awareness and guide the development of user-centric XAI systems tailored to the needs of seafarers and maritime teams.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ankur Samanta, Akshayaa Magesh, Youliang Yu, Runzhe Wu, Ayush Jain, Daniel Jiang, Boris Vidolov, Paul Sajda, Yonathan Efroni, Kaveh Hassani</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are inconsistent reasoners, often generating contradictory responses to identical prompts. While inference-time methods can mitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs struggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes under exploratory sampling. To address this, we formalize self-consistency as an intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that post-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal consensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate. These trajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning in peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating richer consensus signals than single-round majority voting. MACA enables agents to teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer insights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving substantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K), single-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4% Pass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA). These findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3% on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more reliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yue Xin, Wenyuan Wang, Rui Pan, Ruida Wang, Howard Meng, Renjie Pi, Shizhe Diao, Tong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of $2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with $2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks in MMMU.</p>

<p>Abstract: African languages remain underrepresented in natural language processing (NLP), with most corpora limited to formal registers that fail to capture the vibrancy of everyday communication. This work addresses this gap for Shona, a Bantu language spoken in Zimbabwe and Zambia, by introducing a novel Shona--English slang dataset curated from anonymized social media conversations. The dataset is annotated for intent, sentiment, dialogue acts, code-mixing, and tone, and is publicly available at https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/Working_with_shona-slang. We fine-tuned a multilingual DistilBERT classifier for intent recognition, achieving 96.4\% accuracy and 96.3\% F1-score, hosted at https://huggingface.co/HappymoreMasoka. This classifier is integrated into a hybrid chatbot that combines rule-based responses with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle domain-specific queries, demonstrated through a use case assisting prospective students with graduate program information at Pace University. Qualitative evaluation shows the hybrid system outperforms a RAG-only baseline in cultural relevance and user engagement. By releasing the dataset, model, and methodology, this work advances NLP resources for African languages, promoting inclusive and culturally resonant conversational AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai Huang, Yann LeCun, Randall Balestriero</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between language and vision opens up a natural question: {\em can language training methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining. Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting. Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider, RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo families.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Pouramini, Hesham Faili</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large pre-trained language models to new tasks, but most existing approaches are designed for single-task settings, failing to share knowledge across related tasks. We propose Cross-task Prompt Tuning (CrossPT), a modular framework for multi-task prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining task-specific specialization. CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined via a learned attention mechanism. To support robust transfer, we systematically investigate key design factors including prompt initialization, balancing shared and private prompts, number of source prompts, learning rates, task prefixes, and label semantics. Empirical results on GLUE and related benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Prei{\ss}</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded in a variety of natural language processing tasks [Zha+25]. However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to generate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output [Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent work has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal representations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24; SMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can enhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.
  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for hallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them across three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new architecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was developed to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive experiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was shown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods, though generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second, these generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through cross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently improving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks and reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These findings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal representation analysis.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14255">Opening the Black Box: Interpretable LLMs via Semantic Resonance Architecture</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ivan Ternovtsii</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain difficult to interpret. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve efficiency through sparse activation, yet typically rely on opaque, learned gating functions. While similarity-based routing (Cosine Routers) has been explored for training stabilization, its potential for inherent interpretability remains largely untapped. We introduce the Semantic Resonance Architecture (SRA), an MoE approach designed to ensure that routing decisions are inherently interpretable. SRA replaces learned gating with a Chamber of Semantic Resonance (CSR) module, which routes tokens based on cosine similarity with trainable semantic anchors. We also introduce a novel Dispersion Loss that encourages orthogonality among anchors to enforce diverse specialization. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that SRA achieves a validation perplexity of 13.41, outperforming both a dense baseline (14.13) and a Standard MoE baseline (13.53) under matched active parameter constraints (29.0M). Crucially, SRA exhibits superior expert utilization (1.0% dead experts vs. 14.8% in the Standard MoE) and develops distinct, semantically coherent specialization patterns, unlike the noisy specialization observed in standard MoEs. This work establishes semantic routing as a robust methodology for building more transparent and controllable language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the generation of covert advertisements within Conversational AI systems, along with robust techniques for their detection. It explores how subtle promotional content can be crafted within AI-generated responses and introduces methods to identify and mitigate such covert advertising strategies. For generation (Sub-Task~1), we propose a novel framework that leverages user context and query intent to produce contextually relevant advertisements. We employ advanced prompting strategies and curate paired training data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for enhanced stealthiness. For detection (Sub-Task~2), we explore two effective strategies: a fine-tuned CrossEncoder (\texttt{all-mpnet-base-v2}) for direct classification, and a prompt-based reformulation using a fine-tuned \texttt{DeBERTa-v3-base} model. Both approaches rely solely on the response text, ensuring practicality for real-world deployment. Experimental results show high effectiveness in both tasks, achieving a precision of 1.0 and recall of 0.71 for ad generation, and F1-scores ranging from 0.99 to 1.00 for ad detection. These results underscore the potential of our methods to balance persuasive communication with transparency in conversational AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones. Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student often lead to compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered framework in which the student generates trajectories and the teacher intervenes only at the first critical error, producing training data matched to the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement learning starts from the verified prefix before the first critical error, with target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous problem-solving beyond imitation and improves training stability. Particularly, on 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.</p>

In some cases, models sabotage the shutdown mechanism up to 97% of the time. In our experiments, models' inclination to resist shutdown was sensitive to variations in the prompt including how strongly and clearly the allow-shutdown instruction was emphasized, the extent to which the prompts evoke a self-preservation framing, and whether the instruction was in the system prompt or the user prompt (though surprisingly, models were consistently *less* likely to obey instructions to allow shutdown when they were placed in the system prompt).</p>

<p>Abstract: Automated kernel design is critical for overcoming software ecosystem barriers in emerging hardware platforms like RISC-V. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated kernel optimization, demonstrating success in CUDA domains with comprehensive technical documents and mature codebases, their effectiveness remains unproven for reference-scarce domains like RISC-V. We present Evolution of Kernels (EoK), a novel LLM-based evolutionary program search framework that automates kernel design for domains with limited reference material. EoK mitigates reference scarcity by mining and formalizing reusable optimization ideas (general design principles + actionable thoughts) from established kernel libraries' development histories; it then guides parallel LLM explorations using these ideas, enriched via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RISC-V-specific context, prioritizing historically effective techniques. Empirically, EoK achieves a median 1.27x speedup, surpassing human experts on all 80 evaluated kernel design tasks and improving upon prior LLM-based automated kernel design methods by 20%. These results underscore the viability of incorporating human experience into emerging domains and highlight the immense potential of LLM-based automated kernel optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech on social media necessitates automated detection systems that balance accuracy with computational efficiency. This study evaluates 38 model configurations in detecting hate speech across datasets ranging from 6.5K to 451K samples. We analyze transformer architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Distil-BERT), deep neural networks (e.g., CNN, LSTM, GRU, Hierarchical Attention Networks), and traditional machine learning methods (e.g., SVM, CatBoost, Random Forest). Our results show that transformers, particularly RoBERTa, consistently achieve superior performance with accuracy and F1-scores exceeding 90%. Among deep learning approaches, Hierarchical Attention Networks yield the best results, while traditional methods like CatBoost and SVM remain competitive, achieving F1-scores above 88% with significantly lower computational costs. Additionally, our analysis highlights the importance of dataset characteristics, with balanced, moderately sized unprocessed datasets outperforming larger, preprocessed datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Fu, Chun-Le Guo, Chongyi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has drawn urgent attention to the task of machine-generated text detection (MGTD). However, existing approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios: zero-shot detectors rely heavily on scoring model's output distribution while training-based detectors are often constrained by overfitting to the training data, limiting generalization. We found that the performance bottleneck of training-based detectors stems from the misalignment between training objective and task needs. To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL), a novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with task-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core semantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and generalization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection framework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs. To ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse multi-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora across 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17 cutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual styles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing methods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently outperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same training data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our DDL.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhang Jianbin, Yulin Zhu, Wai Lun Lo, Richard Tai-Chiu Hsung, Harris Sik-Ho Tsang, Kai Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end, the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karan Dua, Puneet Mittal, Ranjeet Gupta, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization. Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges, we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity, normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazumi Kasaura, Naoto Onda, Yuta Oriike, Masaya Taniguchi, Akiyoshi Sannai, Sho Sonoda</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated significant promise in formal theorem proving. However, previous works mainly focus on solving existing problems. In this paper, we focus on the ability of LLMs to find novel theorems. We propose Conjecturing-Proving Loop pipeline for automatically generating mathematical conjectures and proving them in Lean 4 format. A feature of our approach is that we generate and prove further conjectures with context including previously generated theorems and their proofs, which enables the generation of more difficult proofs by in-context learning of proof strategies without changing parameters of LLMs. We demonstrated that our framework rediscovered theorems with verification, which were published in past mathematical papers and have not yet formalized. Moreover, at least one of these theorems could not be proved by the LLM without in-context learning, even in natural language, which means that in-context learning was effective for neural theorem proving.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nobin Sarwar, Shubhashis Roy Dipta</p>
<p>Abstract: Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains (e.g., mental health) requires balancing strict confidentiality with model utility and safety. We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring < 173 MB of communication per round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxiang Mai, Qiyue Yin, Wancheng Ni, Pei Xu, Kaiqi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, diversity has emerged as a useful mechanism to enhance the efficiency of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing methods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent characteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among agents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive Diversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that incorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage policy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing inspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of moderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we design an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce competitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and distributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance between competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized centralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the constrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task objectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the SMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon achieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively promoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuntao Du, Zitao Li, Ninghui Li, Bolin Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. However, these advancements have also come with significant privacy concerns. While significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their effectiveness in scaling test-time compute for software engineering tasks. However, these approaches often focus on high-level solutions, with limited attention to optimizing low-level CUDA kernel implementations. Additionally, existing kernel generation benchmarks suffer from exploitable loopholes and insufficient diversity in testing conditions, hindering true generalization assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce robust-kbench, a new benchmark for rigorous evaluation of kernel performance and correctness across varied scenarios. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive agentic framework that automates CUDA kernel discovery, verification, and optimization. This pipeline enables frontier LLMs to translate torch code to CUDA kernels and iteratively improve their runtime within our robust evaluation setting. Our sequential workflow first translates PyTorch code into equivalent CUDA kernels. It then optimizes their runtime using a novel evolutionary meta-generation procedure tailored to the CUDA ecosystem, guided by LLM-based verifiers for correctness and efficient filtering. Evaluated on robust-kbench, our approach produces CUDA kernels outperforming torch implementations for practical applications, including forward and backward passes. It can fuse operations and deploy various runtime optimization strategies. The verifier workflow accurately classifies incorrect kernels, enhancing hardware verification efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in the capabilities of code large language models, leading to their rapid adoption and application across a wide range of domains. However, their further advancements are often constrained by the scarcity of real-world coding problems. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing code problems that emulate authentic real-world scenarios. This framework systematically integrates domain knowledge, domain skills, and coding skills, all of which are meticulously extracted from real-world programming-related datasets, including Stack Overflow and Kaggle. The extracted elements serve as the foundational building blocks for constructing code problems. To align the generated problems with practical applications, application scenarios are also mined from the aforementioned datasets. These scenarios are then utilized to construct a scenario-centric graph that interconnects domain knowledge, domain skills, and coding skills. Based on this structured representation, a sampling strategy on the graph is designed, which effectively controls the generation of a code problem with complexity and diversity, reflects real-world challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art open-source large language models of varying sizes and functionalities, including both coders and general-purpose models, across a diverse set of real-world benchmarks.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14284">The Sum Leaks More Than Its Parts: Compositional Privacy Risks and Mitigations in Multi-Agent Collaboration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Vaidehi Patil, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to multi-agent systems, new privacy risks emerge that extend beyond memorization, direct inference, or single-turn evaluations. In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when composed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover sensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and possible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a framework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly amplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to mitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1) Theory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent by anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2) Collaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate with peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive information spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions that expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign inferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in balancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought alone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our ToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can reduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the highest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining explicit reasoning with defender collaboration. Together, our results expose a new class of risks in collaborative LLM deployments and provide actionable insights for designing safeguards against compositional, context-driven privacy leakage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elham Sadeghi, Xianqi Deng, I-Hsin Lin, Stacy M. Copp, Petko Bogdanov</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Jiang, Zhipeng Zhang, Yu Gao, Zhigang Sun, Yiru Wang, Yuwen Heng, Shuo Wang, Jinhao Chai, Zhuo Chen, Hao Zhao, Hao Sun, Xi Zhang, Anqing Jiang, Chuan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning, autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft, rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3, surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality.

<p>Abstract: Stuttered and dysfluent speech detection systems have traditionally suffered from the trade-off between accuracy and clinical interpretability. While end-to-end deep learning models achieve high performance, their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. This paper looks at the Unconstrained Dysfluency Modeling (UDM) series-the current state-of-the-art framework developed by Berkeley that combines modular architecture, explicit phoneme alignment, and interpretable outputs for real-world clinical deployment. Through extensive experiments involving patients and certified speech-language pathologists (SLPs), we demonstrate that UDM achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1: 0.89+-0.04) while providing clinically meaningful interpretability scores (4.2/5.0). Our deployment study shows 87% clinician acceptance rate and 34% reduction in diagnostic time. The results provide strong evidence that UDM represents a practical pathway toward AI-assisted speech therapy in clinical environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinran Zheng, Xingzhi Qian, Yiling He, Shuo Yang, Lorenzo Cavallaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated malware classification has achieved strong detection performance. Yet, malware behavior auditing seeks causal and verifiable explanations of malicious activities -- essential not only to reveal what malware does but also to substantiate such claims with evidence. This task is challenging, as adversarial intent is often hidden within complex, framework-heavy applications, making manual auditing slow and costly. Large Language Models (LLMs) could help address this gap, but their auditing potential remains largely unexplored due to three limitations: (1) scarce fine-grained annotations for fair assessment; (2) abundant benign code obscuring malicious signals; and (3) unverifiable, hallucination-prone outputs undermining attribution credibility. To close this gap, we introduce MalEval, a comprehensive framework for fine-grained Android malware auditing, designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs support auditing under real-world constraints. MalEval provides expert-verified reports and an updated sensitive API list to mitigate ground truth scarcity and reduce noise via static reachability analysis. Function-level structural representations serve as intermediate attribution units for verifiable evaluation. Building on this, we define four analyst-aligned tasks -- function prioritization, evidence attribution, behavior synthesis, and sample discrimination -- together with domain-specific metrics and a unified workload-oriented score. We evaluate seven widely used LLMs on a curated dataset of recent malware and misclassified benign apps, offering the first systematic assessment of their auditing capabilities. MalEval reveals both promising potential and critical limitations across audit stages, providing a reproducible benchmark and foundation for future research on LLM-enhanced malware behavior auditing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peihao Yan, Jie Lu, Huacheng Zeng, Y. Thomas Hou</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available on GitHub [1].</p>

We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1 robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower and upper body control and object interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We review how sensorimotor control is dictated by interacting neural populations, optimal feedback mechanisms, and the biomechanics of bodies. First, we outline the distributed anatomical loops that shuttle sensorimotor signals between cortex, subcortical regions, and spinal cord. We then summarize evidence that neural population activity occupies low-dimensional, dynamically evolving manifolds during planning and execution of movements. Next, we summarize literature explaining motor behavior through the lens of optimal control theory, which clarifies the role of internal models and feedback during motor control. Finally, recent studies on embodied sensorimotor control address gaps within each framework by aiming to elucidate neural population activity through the explicit control of musculoskeletal dynamics. We close by discussing open problems and opportunities: multi-tasking and cognitively rich behavior, multi-regional circuit models, and the level of anatomical detail needed in body and network models. Together, this review and recent advances point towards reaching an integrative account of the neural control of movement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural Processing Units (NPUs) are key to enabling efficient AI inference in resource-constrained edge environments. While peak tera operations per second (TOPS) is often used to gauge performance, it poorly reflects real-world performance and typically rather correlates with higher silicon cost. To address this, architects must focus on maximizing compute utilization, without sacrificing flexibility. This paper presents the eIQ Neutron efficient-NPU, integrated into a commercial flagship MPU, alongside co-designed compiler algorithms. The architecture employs a flexible, data-driven design, while the compiler uses a constrained programming approach to optimize compute and data movement based on workload characteristics. Compared to the leading embedded NPU and compiler stack, our solution achieves an average speedup of 1.8x (4x peak) at equal TOPS and memory resources across standard AI-benchmarks. Even against NPUs with double the compute and memory resources, Neutron delivers up to 3.3x higher performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Qiao, Sitao Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Extending LLM context windows is crucial for long range tasks. RoPE-based position interpolation (PI) methods like linear and frequency-aware scaling extend input lengths without retraining, while post-training quantization (PTQ) enables practical deployment. We show that combining PI with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled effects long context aliasing, dynamic range dilation, axis grid anisotropy, and outlier shifting that induce position-dependent logit noise. We provide the first systematic analysis of PI plus PTQ and introduce two diagnostics: Interpolation Pressure (per-band phase scaling sensitivity) and Tail Inflation Ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). To address this, we propose Q-ROAR, a RoPE-aware, weight-only stabilization that groups RoPE dimensions into a few frequency bands and performs a small search over per-band scales for W_Q,W_K, with an optional symmetric variant to preserve logit scale. The diagnostics guided search uses a tiny long-context dev set and requires no fine-tuning, kernel, or architecture changes. Empirically, Q-ROAR recovers up to 0.7% accuracy on standard tasks and reduces GovReport perplexity by more than 10%, while preserving short-context performance and compatibility with existing inference stacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become key components of modern software, with prompts acting as their de-facto programming interface. However, prompt design remains largely empirical and small mistakes can cascade into unreliable, insecure, or inefficient behavior. This paper presents the first systematic survey and taxonomy of prompt defects, recurring ways that prompts fail to elicit their intended behavior from LLMs. We organize defects along six dimensions: (1) Specification and Intent, (2) Input and Content, (3) Structure and Formatting, (4) Context and Memory, (5) Performance and Efficiency, and (6) Maintainability and Engineering. Each dimension is refined into fine-grained subtypes, illustrated with concrete examples and root cause analysis. Grounded in software engineering principles, we show how these defects surface in real development workflows and examine their downstream effects. For every subtype, we distill mitigation strategies that span emerging prompt engineering patterns, automated guardrails, testing harnesses, and evaluation frameworks. We then summarize these strategies in a master taxonomy that links defect, impact, and remedy. We conclude with open research challenges and a call for rigorous engineering-oriented methodologies to ensure that LLM-driven systems are dependable by design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijia Ma, Juan Qin, Xingchen Xu, Yong Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative search engines (GEs) leverage large language models (LLMs) to deliver AI-generated summaries with website citations, establishing novel traffic acquisition channels while fundamentally altering the search engine optimization landscape. To investigate the distinctive characteristics of GEs, we collect data through interactions with Google's generative and conventional search platforms, compiling a dataset of approximately ten thousand websites across both channels. Our empirical analysis reveals that GEs exhibit preferences for citing content characterized by significantly higher predictability for underlying LLMs and greater semantic similarity among selected sources. Through controlled experiments utilizing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) APIs, we demonstrate that these citation preferences emerge from intrinsic LLM tendencies to favor content aligned with their generative expression patterns. Motivated by applications of LLMs to optimize website content, we conduct additional experimentation to explore how LLM-based content polishing by website proprietors alters AI summaries, finding that such polishing paradoxically enhances information diversity within AI summaries. Finally, to assess the user-end impact of LLM-induced information increases, we design a generative search engine and recruit Prolific participants to conduct a randomized controlled experiment involving an information-seeking and writing task. We find that higher-educated users exhibit minimal changes in their final outputs' information diversity but demonstrate significantly reduced task completion time when original sites undergo polishing. Conversely, lower-educated users primarily benefit through enhanced information density in their task outputs while maintaining similar completion times across experimental groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kiana Kiashemshaki, Mohammad Jalili Torkamani, Negin Mahmoudi, Meysam Shirdel Bilehsavar</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed the field of natural language processing; however, their vulnerability to biases presents a notable obstacle that threatens both fairness and trust. This review offers an extensive analysis of the bias landscape in LLMs, tracing its roots and expressions across various NLP tasks. Biases are classified into implicit and explicit types, with particular attention given to their emergence from data sources, architectural designs, and contextual deployments. This study advances beyond theoretical analysis by implementing a simulation framework designed to evaluate bias mitigation strategies in practice. The framework integrates multiple approaches including data curation, debiasing during model training, and post-hoc output calibration and assesses their impact in controlled experimental settings. In summary, this work not only synthesizes existing knowledge on bias in LLMs but also contributes original empirical validation through simulation of mitigation strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amber Shore, Russell Scheinberg, Ameeta Agrawal, So Young Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention? This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off: though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasen Lu, Liangchen Song, Mingze Xu, Byeongjoo Ahn, Yanjun Wang, Chen Chen, Afshin Dehghan, Yinfei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiting Tan, Xinghua Qu, Ming Tu, Meng Ge, Andy T. Liu, Philipp Koehn, Lu Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective interactive tool use requires agents to master Tool Integrated Reasoning (TIR): a complex process involving multi-turn planning and long-context dialogue management. To train agents for this dynamic process, particularly in multi-modal contexts, we introduce a sandbox environment for reinforcement learning (RL) that supports interleaved speech-text rollouts. Our core strategy, Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), addresses the challenge of credit assignment in long-horizon tasks by employing a Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluation. To enhance exploration, we integrate a mixed-task training curriculum with mathematical reasoning problems. This unified approach boosts the task pass rate on the text-based $\tau$-bench by over 6% compared to strong RL baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate our framework's suitability for fine-tuning a multi-modal foundation model for agentic tasks. By training a base multi-modal LLM on interleaved speech-text rollouts, we equip it with tool-use abilities, paving the way for more natural, voice-driven interactive agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roman Kovalchuk, Mariana Romanyshyn, Petro Ivaniuk</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OmniGEC, a collection of multilingual silver-standard datasets for the task of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), covering eleven languages: Czech, English, Estonian, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Latvian, Slovene, Swedish, and Ukrainian. These datasets facilitate the development of multilingual GEC solutions and help bridge the data gap in adapting English GEC solutions to multilingual GEC. The texts in the datasets originate from three sources: Wikipedia edits for the eleven target languages, subreddits from Reddit in the eleven target languages, and the Ukrainian-only UberText 2.0 social media corpus. While Wikipedia edits were derived from human-made corrections, the Reddit and UberText 2.0 data were automatically corrected with the GPT-4o-mini model. The quality of the corrections in the datasets was evaluated both automatically and manually. Finally, we fine-tune two open-source large language models - Aya-Expanse (8B) and Gemma-3 (12B) - on the multilingual OmniGEC corpora and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for paragraph-level multilingual GEC. The dataset collection and the best-performing models are available on Hugging Face.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wadduwage Shanika Perera, Haodi Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast, behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihan Cao, Yanbin Kang, Zhengming Xing, Ruijie Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted approach for compressing large neural networks by transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In the context of large language models, token level KD, typically minimizing the KL divergence between student output distribution and teacher output distribution, has shown strong empirical performance. However, prior work assumes student output distribution and teacher output distribution share the same optimal representation space, a premise that may not hold in many cases. To solve this problem, we propose Delta Knowledge Distillation (Delta-KD), a novel extension of token level KD that encourages the student to approximate an optimal representation space by explicitly preserving the distributional shift Delta introduced during the teacher's supervised finetuning (SFT). Empirical results on ROUGE metrics demonstrate that Delta KD substantially improves student performance while preserving more of the teacher's knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transitioned from a futuristic concept reserved for large corporations to a present-day, accessible, and essential growth lever for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). For entrepreneurs and business leaders, strategic AI adoption is no longer an option but an imperative for competitiveness, operational efficiency, and long-term survival. This report provides a comprehensive framework for SME leaders to navigate this technological shift, offering the foundational knowledge, business case, practical applications, and strategic guidance necessary to harness the power of AI. The quantitative evidence supporting AI adoption is compelling; 91% of SMEs using AI report that it directly boosts their revenue. Beyond top-line growth, AI drives profound operational efficiencies, with studies showing it can reduce operational costs by up to 30% and save businesses more than 20 hours of valuable time each month. This transformation is occurring within the context of a seismic economic shift; the global AI market is projected to surge from $233.46 Billion in 2024 to an astonishing $1.77 Trillion by 2032. This paper demystifies the core concepts of AI, presents a business case based on market data, details practical applications, and lays out a phased, actionable adoption strategy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Capturing professionals' decision-making in creative workflows is essential for reflection, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, yet existing methods often leave rationales incomplete and implicit decisions hidden. To address this, we present CLEAR framework that structures reasoning into cognitive decision steps-linked units of actions, artifacts, and self-explanations that make decisions traceable. Building on this framework, we introduce ClearFairy, a think-aloud AI assistant for UI design that detects weak explanations, asks lightweight clarifying questions, and infers missing rationales to ease the knowledge-sharing burden. In a study with twelve creative professionals, 85% of ClearFairy's inferred rationales were accepted, increasing strong explanations from 14% to over 83% of decision steps without adding cognitive demand. The captured steps also enhanced generative AI agents in Figma, yielding next-action predictions better aligned with professionals and producing more coherent design outcomes. For future research on human knowledge-grounded creative AI agents, we release a dataset of captured 417 decision steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengxiang Wang, Nafis Irtiza Tripto, Solha Park, Zhenzhen Li, Jiawei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into personal writing tools, a critical question arises: can LLMs faithfully imitate an individual's writing style from just a few examples? Personal style is often subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet essential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to robustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email, they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums. Further analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations reveal key limitations in effective personalization. Our findings highlight a fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation. To aid future research and for reproducibility, we open-source our data and code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guorui Chen, Yifan Xia, Xiaojun Jia, Zhijiang Li, Philip Torr, Jindong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance security through alignment when widely used, but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks capable of producing inappropriate content. Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs. In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional computational costs during LLM inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huanchen Wang, Wencheng Zhang, Zhiqiang Wang, Zhicong Lu, Yuxin Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language (VL) models have shown transformative potential across various critical domains due to their capability to comprehend multi-modal information. However, their performance frequently degrades under distribution shifts, making it crucial to assess and improve robustness against real-world data corruption encountered in practical applications. While advancements in VL benchmark datasets and data augmentation (DA) have contributed to robustness evaluation and improvement, there remain challenges due to a lack of in-depth comprehension of model behavior as well as the need for expertise and iterative efforts to explore data patterns. Given the achievement of visualization in explaining complex models and exploring large-scale data, understanding the impact of various data corruption on VL models aligns naturally with a visual analytics approach. To address these challenges, we introduce VisMoDAl, a visual analytics framework designed to evaluate VL model robustness against various corruption types and identify underperformed samples to guide the development of effective DA strategies. Grounded in the literature review and expert discussions, VisMoDAl supports multi-level analysis, ranging from examining performance under specific corruptions to task-driven inspection of model behavior and corresponding data slice. Unlike conventional works, VisMoDAl enables users to reason about the effects of corruption on VL models, facilitating both model behavior understanding and DA strategy formulation. The utility of our system is demonstrated through case studies and quantitative evaluations focused on corruption robustness in the image captioning task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into everyday life, AI-powered chatbot mobile applications are increasingly adopted across industries, particularly in the healthcare domain. These chatbots offer accessible and 24/7 support, yet their collection and processing of sensitive health data present critical privacy concerns. While prior research has examined chatbot security, privacy issues specific to AI healthcare chatbots have received limited attention. Our study evaluates the privacy practices of 12 widely downloaded AI healthcare chatbot apps available on the App Store and Google Play in the United States. We conducted a three-step assessment analyzing: (1) privacy settings during sign-up, (2) in-app privacy controls, and (3) the content of privacy policies. The analysis identified significant gaps in user data protection. Our findings reveal that half of the examined apps did not present a privacy policy during sign up, and only two provided an option to disable data sharing at that stage. The majority of apps' privacy policies failed to address data protection measures. Moreover, users had minimal control over their personal data. The study provides key insights for information science researchers, developers, and policymakers to improve privacy protections in AI healthcare chatbot apps.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ATLANTIS, the cyber reasoning system developed by Team Atlanta that won 1st place in the Final Competition of DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) at DEF CON 33 (August 2025). AIxCC (2023-2025) challenged teams to build autonomous cyber reasoning systems capable of discovering and patching vulnerabilities at the speed and scale of modern software. ATLANTIS integrates large language models (LLMs) with program analysis -- combining symbolic execution, directed fuzzing, and static analysis -- to address limitations in automated vulnerability discovery and program repair. Developed by researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Samsung Research, KAIST, and POSTECH, the system addresses core challenges: scaling across diverse codebases from C to Java, achieving high precision while maintaining broad coverage, and producing semantically correct patches that preserve intended behavior. We detail the design philosophy, architectural decisions, and implementation strategies behind ATLANTIS, share lessons learned from pushing the boundaries of automated security when program analysis meets modern AI, and release artifacts to support reproducibility and future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unstructured data, such as text, images, audio, and video, comprises the vast majority of the world's information, yet it remains poorly supported by traditional data systems that rely on structured formats for computation. We argue for a new paradigm, which we call computing on unstructured data, built around three stages: extraction of latent structure, transformation of this structure through data processing techniques, and projection back into unstructured formats. This bi-directional pipeline allows unstructured data to benefit from the analytical power of structured computation, while preserving the richness and accessibility of unstructured representations for human and AI consumption. We illustrate this paradigm through two use cases and present the research components that need to be developed in a new data system called MXFlow.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise settings where they interact with multiple users and are trained or fine-tuned on sensitive internal data. While fine-tuning enhances performance by internalizing domain knowledge, it also introduces a critical security risk: leakage of confidential training data to unauthorized users. These risks are exacerbated when LLMs are combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines that dynamically fetch contextual documents at inference time.
  We demonstrate data exfiltration attacks on AI assistants where adversaries can exploit current fine-tuning and RAG architectures to leak sensitive information by leveraging the lack of access control enforcement. We show that existing defenses, including prompt sanitization, output filtering, system isolation, and training-level privacy mechanisms, are fundamentally probabilistic and fail to offer robust protection against such attacks.
  We take the position that only a deterministic and rigorous enforcement of fine-grained access control during both fine-tuning and RAG-based inference can reliably prevent the leakage of sensitive data to unauthorized recipients.
  We introduce a framework centered on the principle that any content used in training, retrieval, or generation by an LLM is explicitly authorized for \emph{all users involved in the interaction}. Our approach offers a simple yet powerful paradigm shift for building secure multi-user LLM systems that are grounded in classical access control but adapted to the unique challenges of modern AI workflows. Our solution has been deployed in Microsoft Copilot Tuning, a product offering that enables organizations to fine-tune models using their own enterprise-specific data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC) module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4% and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA.

<p>Abstract: With the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive applications, online malicious intent detection has become increasingly critical. However, existing approaches fall short of handling diverse and complex user queries in real time. To address these challenges, we introduce ADRAG (Adversarial Distilled Retrieval-Augmented Guard), a two-stage framework for robust and efficient online malicious intent detection. In the training stage, a high-capacity teacher model is trained on adversarially perturbed, retrieval-augmented inputs to learn robust decision boundaries over diverse and complex user queries. In the inference stage, a distillation scheduler transfers the teacher's knowledge into a compact student model, with a continually updated knowledge base collected online. At deployment, the compact student model leverages top-K similar safety exemplars retrieved from the online-updated knowledge base to enable both online and real-time malicious query detection. Evaluations across ten safety benchmarks demonstrate that ADRAG, with a 149M-parameter model, achieves 98.5% of WildGuard-7B's performance, surpasses GPT-4 by 3.3% and Llama-Guard-3-8B by 9.5% on out-of-distribution detection, while simultaneously delivering up to 5.6x lower latency at 300 queries per second (QPS) in real-time applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanlong Wan, Xing Lu, Yan Chen, Karthik Devaprasad, Laura Hinkle</p>
<p>Abstract: Dynamic energy systems and controls require advanced modeling frameworks to design and test supervisory and fault tolerant strategies. Modelica is a widely used equation based language, but developing control modules is labor intensive and requires specialized expertise. This paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of Control Description Language modules in the Building Modelica Library as a case study. We developed a structured workflow that combines standardized prompt scaffolds, library aware grounding, automated compilation with OpenModelica, and human in the loop evaluation. Experiments were carried out on four basic logic tasks (And, Or, Not, and Switch) and five control modules (chiller enable/disable, bypass valve control, cooling tower fan speed, plant requests, and relief damper control). The results showed that GPT 4o failed to produce executable Modelica code in zero shot mode, while Claude Sonnet 4 achieved up to full success for basic logic blocks with carefully engineered prompts. For control modules, success rates reached 83 percent, and failed outputs required medium level human repair (estimated one to eight hours). Retrieval augmented generation often produced mismatches in module selection (for example, And retrieved as Or), while a deterministic hard rule search strategy avoided these errors. Human evaluation also outperformed AI evaluation, since current LLMs cannot assess simulation results or validate behavioral correctness. Despite these limitations, the LLM assisted workflow reduced the average development time from 10 to 20 hours down to 4 to 6 hours per module, corresponding to 40 to 60 percent time savings. These results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LLM assisted Modelica generation, and point to future research in pre simulation validation, stronger grounding, and closed loop evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linxi Xie, Xin Teng, Shichang Ke, Hongyi Wen, Shengjie Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated effectiveness in removing the influence of undesirable data (also known as forget data). Existing approaches typically assume full access to the forget dataset, overlooking two key challenges: (1) Forget data is often privacy-sensitive, rare, or legally regulated, making it expensive or impractical to obtain (2) The distribution of available forget data may not align with how that information is represented within the model. To address these limitations, we propose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data, where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions. To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterative unlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model's weight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method balances the tradeoff between forget quality and utility preservation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taesoo Kim, Yongsik Jo, Hyunmin Song, Taehwan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Human conversation involves language, speech, and visual cues, with each medium providing complementary information. For instance, speech conveys a vibe or tone not fully captured by text alone. While multimodal LLMs focus on generating text responses from diverse inputs, less attention has been paid to generating natural and engaging speech. We propose a human-like agent that generates speech responses based on conversation mood and responsive style information. To achieve this, we build a novel MultiSensory Conversation dataset focused on speech to enable agents to generate natural speech. We then propose a multimodal LLM-based model for generating text responses and voice descriptions, which are used to generate speech covering paralinguistic information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing both visual and audio modalities in conversation to generate engaging speech.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miseul Kim, Soo Jin Park, Kyungguen Byun, Hyeon-Kyeong Shin, Sunkuk Moon, Shuhua Zhang, Erik Visser</p>
<p>Abstract: Speaker diarization systems often struggle with high intrinsic intra-speaker variability, such as shifts in emotion, health, or content. This can cause segments from the same speaker to be misclassified as different individuals, for example, when one raises their voice or speaks faster during conversation. To address this, we propose a style-controllable speech generation model that augments speech across diverse styles while preserving the target speaker's identity. The proposed system starts with diarized segments from a conventional diarizer. For each diarized segment, it generates augmented speech samples enriched with phonetic and stylistic diversity. And then, speaker embeddings from both the original and generated audio are blended to enhance the system's robustness in grouping segments with high intrinsic intra-speaker variability. We validate our approach on a simulated emotional speech dataset and the truncated AMI dataset, demonstrating significant improvements, with error rate reductions of 49% and 35% on each dataset, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuemin Wu, Zhongze Wu, Xiu Su, Feng Yang, Hongyan Xu, Xi Lin, Wenti Huang, Shan You, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling dynamic temporal dependencies is a critical challenge in time series pre-training, which evolve due to distribution shifts and multi-scale patterns. This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources, improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models~(LLMs) become widely adopted, ensuring their alignment with human values is crucial to prevent jailbreaks where adversaries manipulate models to produce harmful content. While most defenses target single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues, exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A, a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergio Benlloch-Lopez, Miquel Viel-Vazquez, Javier Naranjo-Alcazar, Jordi Grau-Haro, Pedro Zuccarello</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of IoT nodes equipped with microphones and capable of performing on-device audio classification exposes highly sensitive data while operating under tight resource constraints. To protect against this, we present a defence-in-depth architecture comprising a security protocol that treats the edge device, cellular network and cloud backend as three separate trust domains, linked by TPM-based remote attestation and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3. A STRIDE-driven threat model and attack-tree analysis guide the design. At startup, each boot stage is measured into TPM PCRs. The node can only decrypt its LUKS-sealed partitions after the cloud has verified a TPM quote and released a one-time unlock key. This ensures that rogue or tampered devices remain inert. Data in transit is protected by TLS 1.3 and hybridised with Kyber and Dilithium to provide post-quantum resilience. Meanwhile, end-to-end encryption and integrity hashes safeguard extracted audio features. Signed, rollback-protected AI models and tamper-responsive sensors harden firmware and hardware. Data at rest follows a 3-2-1 strategy comprising a solid-state drive sealed with LUKS, an offline cold archive encrypted with a hybrid post-quantum cipher and an encrypted cloud replica. Finally, we set out a plan for evaluating the physical and logical security of the proposed protocol.</p>

In this work, we focus on spatial audio understanding with an emphasis on reasoning about moving sources. First, we introduce a spatial audio encoder that processes spatial audio to detect multiple overlapping events and estimate their spatial attributes, Direction of Arrival (DoA) and source distance, at the frame level. To generalize to unseen events, we incorporate an audio grounding model that aligns audio features with semantic audio class text embeddings via a cross-attention mechanism. Second, to answer complex queries about dynamic audio scenes involving moving sources, we condition a large language model (LLM) on structured spatial attributes extracted by our model. Finally, we introduce a spatial audio motion understanding and reasoning benchmark dataset and demonstrate our framework's performance against the baseline model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobo Xing, Wei Yuan, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Xiangliang Zhang, Hongzhi Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with fine-grained semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both modalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight 2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path (either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair, effectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. In addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of 4.02%.

<p>Abstract: Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian Gao, Zongyun Zhang, Ting Liu, Yuzhuo Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer interactions, which play a crucial role in supporting cognitive development and learning engagement. Although previous studies have utilized large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive dynamic learning environments for students, these interactions remain limited to conversational exchanges, lacking insights and adaptations to the learners' individualized learning and cognitive states. As a result, students' interest in discussions with AI learning companions is low, and they struggle to gain inspiration from such interactions. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs that integrates the Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate is capable of simulating peer-like agent roles, adapting to learners' cognitive states during collaborative discussions, and inferring their psychological states, such as misunderstandings, confusion, or motivation. By incorporating Theory of Mind capabilities, the system can dynamically adjust its interaction strategies to support the development of higher-order thinking and cognition. Experimental results in simulated learning scenarios demonstrate that OnlineMate effectively fosters deep learning and discussions while enhancing cognitive engagement in online educational settings.</p>

Recent advances in learning-based CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However, ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and topological correctness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design, which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions, including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients, the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongjun Wang, Jiyuan Chen, Zhengwei Yin, Xuan Song, Yinqiang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG), while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs). However, existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure. Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses, Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duojia Li, Shenghui Lu, Hongchen Pan, Zongyi Zhan, Qingyang Hong, Lin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multistep inference is a bottleneck for real-time generative speech enhancement because flow- and diffusion-based systems learn an instantaneous velocity field and therefore rely on iterative ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers. We introduce MeanFlowSE, a conditional generative model that learns the average velocity over finite intervals along a trajectory. Using a Jacobian-vector product (JVP) to instantiate the MeanFlow identity, we derive a local training objective that directly supervises finite-interval displacement while remaining consistent with the instantaneous-field constraint on the diagonal. At inference, MeanFlowSE performs single-step generation via a backward-in-time displacement, removing the need for multistep solvers; an optional few-step variant offers additional refinement. On VoiceBank-DEMAND, the single-step model achieves strong intelligibility, fidelity, and perceptual quality with substantially lower computational cost than multistep baselines. The method requires no knowledge distillation or external teachers, providing an efficient, high-fidelity framework for real-time generative speech enhancement.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs) alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step, producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and interpretable image classification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengwei Wang, Gang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) show considerable potential in graph representation learning. The architecture of GTs typically integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with global attention mechanisms either in parallel or as a precursor to attention mechanisms, yielding a local-and-global or local-to-global attention scheme. However, as the global attention mechanism primarily captures long-range dependencies between nodes, these integration schemes may suffer from information loss, where the local neighborhood information learned by GNN could be diluted by the attention mechanism. Therefore, we propose G2LFormer, featuring a novel global-to-local attention scheme where the shallow network layers use attention mechanisms to capture global information, while the deeper layers employ GNN modules to learn local structural information, thereby preventing nodes from ignoring their immediate neighbors. An effective cross-layer information fusion strategy is introduced to allow local layers to retain beneficial information from global layers and alleviate information loss, with acceptable trade-offs in scalability. To validate the feasibility of the global-to-local attention scheme, we compare G2LFormer with state-of-the-art linear GTs and GNNs on node-level and graph-level tasks. The results indicate that G2LFormer exhibits excellent performance while keeping linear complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: We conducted rigorous ablation studies to validate DPANet's key components (Table \ref{tab:ablation-study}). The full model consistently outperforms all variants. To test our dual-domain hypothesis, we designed two specialized versions: a Temporal-Only model (fusing two identical temporal pyramids) and a Frequency-Only model (fusing two spectral pyramids). Both variants underperformed significantly, confirming that the fusion of heterogeneous temporal and frequency information is critical. Furthermore, replacing the cross-attention mechanism with a simpler method (w/o Cross-Fusion) caused the most severe performance degradation. This result underscores that our interactive fusion block is the most essential component.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohin Gillgallon, Giacomo Bergami, Reham Almutairi, Graham Morgan</p>
<p>Abstract: While simulators exist for vehicular IoT nodes communicating with the Cloud through Edge nodes in a fully-simulated osmotic architecture, they often lack support for dynamic agent planning and optimisation to minimise vehicular battery consumption while ensuring fair communication times. Addressing these challenges requires extending current simulator architectures with AI algorithms for both traffic prediction and dynamic agent planning. This paper presents an extension of SimulatorOrchestrator (SO) to meet these requirements. Preliminary results over a realistic urban dataset show that utilising vehicular planning algorithms can lead to improved battery and QoS performance compared with traditional shortest path algorithms. The additional inclusion of desirability areas enabled more ambulances to be routed to their target destinations while utilising less energy to do so, compared to traditional and weighted algorithms without desirability considerations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Shen, Junying Wang, Farong Wen, Yijin Guo, Qi Jia, Zicheng Zhang, Guangtao Zhai</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred the creation of numerous benchmarks. However, conventional full-coverage Question-Answering evaluations suffer from high redundancy and low efficiency. Inspired by human interview processes, we propose a multi-to-one interview paradigm for efficient MLLM evaluation. Our framework consists of (i) a two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases, (ii) dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights to ensure fairness, and (iii) an adaptive mechanism for question difficulty-level chosen. Experiments on different benchmarks show that the proposed paradigm achieves significantly higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, with improvements of up to 17.6% in PLCC and 16.7% in SRCC, while reducing the number of required questions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed paradigm provides a reliable and efficient alternative for large-scale MLLM benchmarking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangdi Wang, Zhiyue Wu, Dinghao Zhou, Rui Lin, Junyu Dai, Tao Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are essential for large-scale audio tasks like diffusion-based generation. However, existing open-source models often neglect auditory perceptual aspects during training, leading to weaknesses in phase accuracy and stereophonic spatial representation. To address these challenges, we propose {\epsilon}ar-VAE, an open-source music signal reconstruction model that rethinks and optimizes the VAE training paradigm. Our contributions are threefold: (i) A K-weighting perceptual filter applied prior to loss calculation to align the objective with auditory perception. (ii) Two novel phase losses: a Correlation Loss for stereo coherence, and a Phase Loss using its derivatives--Instantaneous Frequency and Group Delay--for precision. (iii) A new spectral supervision paradigm where magnitude is supervised by all four Mid/Side/Left/Right components, while phase is supervised only by the LR components. Experiments show {\epsilon}ar-VAE at 44.1kHz substantially outperforms leading open-source models across diverse metrics, showing particular strength in reconstructing high-frequency harmonics and the spatial characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Yousefiramandi, Ciaran Cooney</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of catastrophic forgetting and modality inequivalence in speech large language models, showing that introducing speech capabilities can degrade knowledge and reasoning even when inputs remain textual, and performance further decreases with spoken queries. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages both text-to-text and speech-to-text channels to transfer knowledge from a text-based teacher model to a speech LLM. Extensive experiments on dialogue and audio understanding tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving textual knowledge, improving cross-modal alignment, and enhancing reasoning in speech-based interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaolei Xu, Chaoyue Niu, Guy J. Brown, Hector Romero, Ning Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent condition with significant health consequences, yet many patients remain undiagnosed due to the complexity and cost of over-night polysomnography. Acoustic-based screening provides a scalable alternative, yet performance is limited by environmental noise and the lack of physiological context. Respiratory effort is a key signal used in clinical scoring of OSA events, but current approaches require additional contact sensors that reduce scalability and patient comfort. This paper presents the first study to estimate respiratory effort directly from nocturnal audio, enabling physiological context to be recovered from sound alone. We propose a latent-space fusion framework that integrates the estimated effort embeddings with acoustic features for OSA detection. Using a dataset of 157 nights from 103 participants recorded in home environments, our respiratory effort estimator achieves a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.48, capturing meaningful respiratory dynamics. Fusing effort and audio improves sensitivity and AUC over audio-only baselines, especially at low apnoea-hypopnoea index thresholds. The proposed approach requires only smartphone audio at test time, which enables sensor-free, scalable, and longitudinal OSA monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Selitskiy, Akib Shahriyar, Jishnuraj Prakasan</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we show that discrete optimal transport (DOT) is an effective black-box adversarial attack against modern audio anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs). Our attack operates as a post-processing, distribution-alignment step: frame-level WavLM embeddings of generated speech are aligned to an unpaired bona fide pool via entropic OT and a top-$k$ barycentric projection, then decoded with a neural vocoder. Evaluated on ASVspoof2019 and ASVspoof5 with AASIST baselines, DOT yields consistently high equal error rate (EER) across datasets and remains competitive after CM fine-tuning, outperforming several conventional attacks in cross-dataset transfer. Ablation analysis highlights the practical impact of vocoder overlap. Results indicate that distribution-level alignment is a powerful and stable attack surface for deployed CMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingwu Zhang, Guanxuan Li, Zhuocheng Zhang, Zijun Long</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ju Dong, Lei Zhang, Liding Zhang, Yao Ling, Yu Fu, Kaixin Bai, Zolt\'an-Csaba M\'arton, Zhenshan Bing, Zhaopeng Chen, Alois Christian Knoll, Jianwei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable, struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP (ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation in unstructured environments.

<p>Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems, must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning control policies and investigate the relationship between object characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a Blockchain-Integrated Explainable AI Framework (BXHF) for healthcare systems to tackle two essential challenges confronting health information networks: safe data exchange and comprehensible AI-driven clinical decision-making. Our architecture incorporates blockchain, ensuring patient records are immutable, auditable, and tamper-proof, alongside Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies that yield transparent and clinically relevant model predictions. By incorporating security assurances and interpretability requirements into a unified optimization pipeline, BXHF ensures both data-level trust (by verified and encrypted record sharing) and decision-level trust (with auditable and clinically aligned explanations). Its hybrid edge-cloud architecture allows for federated computation across different institutions, enabling collaborative analytics while protecting patient privacy. We demonstrate the framework's applicability through use cases such as cross-border clinical research networks, uncommon illness detection and high-risk intervention decision support. By ensuring transparency, auditability, and regulatory compliance, BXHF improves the credibility, uptake, and effectiveness of AI in healthcare, laying the groundwork for safer and more reliable clinical decision-making.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term, while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanting Xie, Bingheng Li, Erlin Pan, Rui Hou, Wenyu Chen, Zhao Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks, driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential, remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations. Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question: Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

In this paper we analyze what changes LLMs make in a text rewriting setting. We focus specifically on argumentative texts and their improvement, a task named Argument Improvement (ArgImp). We present CLEAR: an evaluation pipeline consisting of 57 metrics mapped to four linguistic levels: lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. This pipeline is used to examine the qualities of LLM-rewritten arguments on a broad set of argumentation corpora and compare the behavior of different LLMs on this task and analyze the behavior of different LLMs on this task in terms of linguistic levels. By taking all four linguistic levels into consideration, we find that the models perform ArgImp by shortening the texts while simultaneously increasing average word length and merging sentences. Overall we note an increase in the persuasion and coherence dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyang Duan, Zongyuan Zhang, Songxiao Guo, Yuanye Zhao, Zheng Lin, Zihan Fang, Yi Liu, Dianxin Luan, Dong Huang, Heming Cui, Yong Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments is challenging, as changing dynamics and rewards quickly make past experiences outdated. Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes. DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juwon Kim, Hyunwook Lee, Hyotaek Jeon, Seungmin Jin, Sungahn Ko</p>
<p>Abstract: Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency. To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in 11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive predictive outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Ackermann, Moritz Spang, Hamza A. A. Gardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents, substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments where pure exploration proves insufficient.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper develops alternative hyperparameters for specifying sparse Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These hyperparameters allow for varying sparsity within the trainable weight matrices of the model while improving overall performance. This architecture enables the definition of a novel metric, hidden proportion, which seeks to balance the distribution of unknowns within the model and provides significant explanatory power of model performance. Together, the use of the varied sparsity RNN architecture combined with the hidden proportion metric generates significant performance gains while improving performance expectations on an a priori basis. This combined approach provides a path forward towards generalized meta-learning applications and model optimization based on intrinsic characteristics of the data set, including input and output dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Alvetreti, Jary Pomponi, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Simone Scardapane</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL) framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication overheads while maintaining high accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems remain prone to errors that affect downstream applications. In this paper, we propose LIR-ASR, a heuristic optimized iterative correction framework using LLMs, inspired by human auditory perception. LIR-ASR applies a "Listening-Imagining-Refining" strategy, generating phonetic variants and refining them in context. A heuristic optimization with finite state machine (FSM) is introduced to prevent the correction process from being trapped in local optima and rule-based constraints help maintain semantic fidelity. Experiments on both English and Chinese ASR outputs show that LIR-ASR achieves average reductions in CER/WER of up to 1.5 percentage points compared to baselines, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains in transcription.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humanitarian Mine Action has generated extensive best-practice knowledge, but much remains locked in unstructured reports. We introduce TextMine, an ontology-guided pipeline that uses Large Language Models to extract knowledge triples from HMA texts. TextMine integrates document chunking, domain-aware prompting, triple extraction, and both reference-based and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. We also create the first HMA ontology and a curated dataset of real-world demining reports. Experiments show ontology-aligned prompts boost extraction accuracy by 44.2%, cut hallucinations by 22.5%, and improve format conformance by 20.9% over baselines. While validated on Cambodian reports, TextMine can adapt to global demining efforts or other domains, transforming unstructured data into structured knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract: Partial agent failure becomes inevitable when systems scale up, making it crucial to identify the subset of agents whose compromise would most severely degrade overall performance. In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability of each agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Song, Yanming Yang, Tong Zhao, Ruibo Li, Chi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stelios Katsis, Vassilis Lyberatos, Spyridon Kantarelis, Edmund Dervakos, Giorgos Stamou</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio effects (FX) such as reverberation, distortion, modulation, and dynamic range processing play a pivotal role in shaping emotional responses during music listening. While prior studies have examined links between low-level audio features and affective perception, the systematic impact of audio FX on emotion remains underexplored. This work investigates how foundation models - large-scale neural architectures pretrained on multimodal data - can be leveraged to analyze these effects. Such models encode rich associations between musical structure, timbre, and affective meaning, offering a powerful framework for probing the emotional consequences of sound design techniques. By applying various probing methods to embeddings from deep learning models, we examine the complex, nonlinear relationships between audio FX and estimated emotion, uncovering patterns tied to specific effects and evaluating the robustness of foundation audio models. Our findings aim to advance understanding of the perceptual impact of audio production practices, with implications for music cognition, performance, and affective computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobo Yang, Minghao Guo, Dequan Yang, Wenyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i) incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pak-Hei Yeung, Jayroop Ramesh, Pengfei Lyu, Ana Namburete, Jagath Rajapakse</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic, allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its adaptability as more advanced models emerge.

<p>Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset, our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC, offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.</p>

<p>Abstract: WARNING: This paper contains examples of offensive materials. Toxic content has become pervasive on social media platforms. We introduce SMARTER, a data-efficient two-stage framework for explainable content moderation using Large Language Models (LLMs). In Stage 1, we leverage LLMs' own outputs to generate synthetic explanations for both correct and incorrect labels, enabling alignment via preference optimization with minimal human supervision. In Stage 2, we refine explanation quality through cross-model training, allowing weaker models to align stylistically and semantically with stronger ones. Experiments on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate -- demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1 improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the full training data. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource settings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both classification and explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeongbin Seo, Dongha Lee, Jaehyung Kim, Jinyoung Yeo</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifeng Peng, Xinyi Li, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Kaining Zhang, Zhiding Liang, Ying Wang, Yuxuan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Variational quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading candidate for harnessing quantum computers to advance quantum chemistry and materials simulations, yet its training efficiency deteriorates rapidly for large Hamiltonians. Two issues underlie this bottleneck: (i) the no-cloning theorem imposes a linear growth in circuit evaluations with the number of parameters per gradient step; and (ii) deeper circuits encounter barren plateaus (BPs), leading to exponentially increasing measurement overheads. To address these challenges, here we propose a deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive parameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of Hamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy. The motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of parameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics. Its design combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy, ensuring each training example is informative and BP-resilient, with an adaptive neural architecture that generalizes across ansatze of varying sizes. Across benchmark transverse-field Ising models, Heisenberg models, and multiple molecule systems up to 30 qubits, Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and 40% to 60% fewer circuit evaluations than state-of-the-art baselines, while matching or surpassing their estimation accuracy. By proactively trimming parameter space, Titan lowers hardware demands and offers a scalable path toward utilizing VQE to advance practical quantum chemistry and materials science.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fuzz testing is one of the most effective techniques for finding software vulnerabilities. While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a complete fuzzing campaign.
  We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision. Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Si, Qianyi Wu, Chaitanya Amballa, Romit Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Realistic sound simulation plays a critical role in many applications. A key element in sound simulation is the room impulse response (RIR), which characterizes how sound propagates from a source to a listener within a given space. Recent studies have applied neural implicit methods to learn RIR using context information collected from the environment, such as scene images. However, these approaches do not effectively leverage explicit geometric information from the environment. To further exploit the potential of neural implicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural Acoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and extracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context. Our approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features can better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR predictions. Through comparisons with conventional and state-of-the-art baseline methods, we show that MiNAF performs competitively across various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we verify the robustness of MiNAF in datasets with limited training samples, demonstrating an advance in high-fidelity sound simulation.</p>

<p>Abstract: AutomationML has seen widespread adoption as an open data exchange format in the automation domain. It is an open and vendor neutral standard based on the extensible markup language XML. However, AutomationML extends XML with additional semantics that limit the applicability of common XML-tools for applications like querying or data validation. This article demonstrates how the transformation of AutomationML into OWL enables new use cases in querying with SPARQL and validation with SHACL. To support this, it provides practitioners with (1) an up-to-date ontology of the concepts defined in the AutomationML standard and (2) a declarative mapping to automatically transform any AutomationML model into RDF triples. A study on examples from the automation domain concludes that transforming AutomationML to OWL opens up new powerful ways for querying and validation that would have been impossible without this transformation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level skills, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

<p>Abstract: LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings. While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks: Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative evaluation settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuiye Ding, Fanda Fan, Yao Wang, Ruijie jian, Xiaorui Wang, Luqi Gong, Yishan Jiang, Chunjie Luo, Jianfeng Zhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dan Ivanov, Tristan Freiberg, Shirin Shahabi, Jonathan Gold, Haruna Isah</p>
<p>Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value. We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies suited to diverse deployment needs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zizhen Li, Chuanhao Li, Yibin Wang, Qi Chen, Diping Song, Yukang Feng, Jianwen Sun, Jiaxin Ai, Fanrui Zhang, Mingzhu Sun, Kaipeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edgar Dobriban</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology, promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default, they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation, as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI. In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics, explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future directions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guang Yang, Tiancheng Jin, Liang Dou</p>
<p>Abstract: Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bowen Xi, Kevin Scaria, Divyagna Bavikadi, Paulo Shakarian</p>
<p>Abstract: Classification of movement trajectories has many applications in transportation and is a key component for large-scale movement trajectory generation and anomaly detection which has key safety applications in the aftermath of a disaster or other external shock. However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment is a general-purpose detector for high-energy collision at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system.

<p>Abstract: EXPLOR is a novel framework that utilizes support-expanding, extrapolatory pseudo-labeling to improve prediction and uncertainty-based rejection on out-of-distribution (OOD) points. EXPLOR utilizes a diverse set of base models as pseudo-labelers on the expansive augmented data to improve OOD performance through multiple MLP heads (one per base model) with shared embedding trained with a novel per-head matching loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on modality-specific augmentations or assume access to OOD data, EXPLOR introduces extrapolatory pseudo-labeling on latent-space augmentations, enabling robust OOD generalization with any real-valued vector data. In contrast to prior modality-agnostic methods with neural backbones, EXPLOR is model-agnostic, working effectively with methods from simple tree-based models to complex OOD generalization models. We demonstrate that EXPLOR achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets in single-source domain generalization settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Tang, Ye Liu, Xi Zhao, Xukai Liu, Yanghai Zhang, Kai Zhang, Xiaofang Zhou, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted substantial interest due to their exceptional performance on graph-based data. However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion has been increasingly adopted as a useful method for helping address several tasks in biomedical research, such as drug repurposing or drug-target identification. To that end, a variety of datasets and Knowledge Graph Embedding models have been proposed over the years. However, little is known about the properties that render a dataset, and associated modelling choices, useful for a given task. Moreover, even though theoretical properties of Knowledge Graph Embedding models are well understood, their practical utility in this field remains controversial. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the topological properties of publicly available biomedical Knowledge Graphs and establish links to the accuracy observed in real-world tasks. By releasing all model predictions and a new suite of analysis tools we invite the community to build upon our work and continue improving the understanding of these crucial applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongxin Ding, Yue Fang, Runchuan Zhu, Xinke Jiang, Jinyang Zhang, Yongxin Xu, Xu Chu, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle in specialized domains like healthcare due to limited domain-specific knowledge.Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT) data construction for domain adaptation often relies on heuristic methods, such as GPT-4 annotation or manual data selection, with a data-centric focus on presumed diverse, high-quality datasets. However, these methods overlook the model's inherent knowledge distribution, introducing noise, redundancy, and irrelevant data, leading to a mismatch between the selected data and the model's learning task, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage model-centric data selection framework, Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection (3DS), which aligns data with the model's knowledge distribution for optimized adaptation. In Stage1, we apply Prompt-Driven Data Selection via Explicit Alignment, where the the model filters irrelevant or redundant data based on its internal knowledge. In Stage2, we perform Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection, where data selection is guided by our defined difficulty decomposition, using three metrics: Instruction Understanding, Response Confidence, and Response Correctness. Additionally, an attention-based importance weighting mechanism captures token importance for more accurate difficulty calibration. This two-stage approach ensures the selected data is not only aligned with the model's knowledge and preferences but also appropriately challenging for the model to learn, leading to more effective and targeted domain adaptation. In the case study of the medical domain, our extensive experiments on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the superiority of 3DS over exisiting methods in accuracy by over 5.29%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuchao Pang, Zhigang Lu, Haichen Wang, Peng Fu, Yongbin Zhou, Minhui Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto privacy standard against privacy leakage attacks, including many recently discovered ones against large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that LLMs could reconstruct the altered/removed privacy from given DP-sanitized prompts. We propose two attacks (black-box and white-box) based on the accessibility to LLMs and show that LLMs could connect the pair of DP-sanitized text and the corresponding private training data of LLMs by giving sample text pairs as instructions (in the black-box attacks) or fine-tuning data (in the white-box attacks). To illustrate our findings, we conduct comprehensive experiments on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3, Claude-3.5, OPT, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, Gemma-2, and Pythia) using commonly used datasets (such as WikiMIA, Pile-CC, and Pile-Wiki) against both word-level and sentence-level DP. The experimental results show promising recovery rates, e.g., the black-box attacks against the word-level DP over WikiMIA dataset gave 72.18% on LLaMA-2 (70B), 82.39% on LLaMA-3 (70B), 75.35% on Gemma-2, 91.2% on ChatGPT-4o, and 94.01% on Claude-3.5 (Sonnet). More urgently, this study indicates that these well-known LLMs have emerged as a new security risk for existing DP text sanitization approaches in the current environment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Legal research depends on headnotes: concise summaries that help lawyers quickly identify relevant cases. Yet, many court decisions lack them due to the high cost of manual annotation. To address this gap, we introduce the Swiss Landmark Decisions Summarization (SLDS) dataset containing 20K rulings from the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, each with headnotes in German, French, and Italian. SLDS has the potential to significantly improve access to legal information and transform legal research in Switzerland. We fine-tune open models (Qwen2.5, Llama 3.2, Phi-3.5) and compare them to larger general-purpose and reasoning-tuned LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and the open-source DeepSeek R1. Using an LLM-as-a-Judge framework, we find that fine-tuned models perform well in terms of lexical similarity, while larger models generate more legally accurate and coherent summaries. Interestingly, reasoning-focused models show no consistent benefit, suggesting that factual precision is more important than deep reasoning in this task. We release SLDS under a CC BY 4.0 license to support future research in cross-lingual legal summarization.</p>

<p>Abstract: While inorganic retrosynthesis planning is essential in the field of chemical science, the application of machine learning in this area has been notably less explored compared to organic retrosynthesis planning. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Retro for inorganic retrosynthesis planning, which implicitly extracts the precursor information of reference materials that are retrieved from the knowledge base regarding domain expertise in the field. Specifically, instead of directly employing the precursor information of reference materials, we propose implicitly extracting it with various attention layers, which enables the model to learn novel synthesis recipes more effectively. Moreover, during retrieval, we consider the thermodynamic relationship between target material and precursors, which is essential domain expertise in identifying the most probable precursor set among various options. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Retrieval-Retro in retrosynthesis planning, especially in discovering novel synthesis recipes, which is crucial for materials discovery.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahdi Movahedian Moghaddam, Kourosh Parand, Saeed Reza Kheradpisheh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, fractional types, and Helmholtz-type integral equations involving oscillatory kernels. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accuracy numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms not only classical PINNs but also advanced variants such as Auxiliary PINN (A-PINN) and Self-Adaptive PINN (SA-PINN), achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. These results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixi Wang, Xiangxu Zhao, Tonglan Xie, Mengmeng Jing, Lin Zuo</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain shifts are critical issues that harm the performance of machine learning. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) mitigates this issue but suffers when the domain shifts are steep and drastic. Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) alleviates this problem in a mild way by gradually adapting from the source to the target domain using multiple intermediate domains. In this paper, we propose Sliding Window Adversarial Training (SWAT) for GDA. SWAT first formulates adversarial streams to connect the feature spaces of the source and target domains. Then, a sliding window paradigm is designed that moves along the adversarial stream to gradually narrow the small gap between adjacent intermediate domains. When the window moves to the end of the stream, i.e., the target domain, the domain shift is explicitly reduced. Extensive experiments on six GDA benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of SWAT, especially 6.1% improvement on Rotated MNIST and 4.1% advantage on CIFAR-100C over the previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Wang, Nan Yang, Liang Wang, Furu Wei, Fuli Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have led to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning across various benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks rely on automatic evaluation methods that only compare final answers using heuristics, without verifying the underlying reasoning steps. This limitation results in false positive solutions, where models may produce correct final answers but with flawed deduction paths. In this paper, we systematically examine the prevalence of false positive solutions in mathematical problem solving for language models. We analyze the characteristics and extent of this issue across different open-source models, datasets of varying difficulty levels, and decoding strategies. Specifically, we explore how false positives influence the inference time scaling behavior of language models. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) false positive solutions persist across different models, datasets, and decoding methods, (2) sampling-based inference time scaling methods do not alleviate the problem, and (3) the pass@N evaluation metric is more susceptible to false positives, suggesting a significantly lower scaling ceiling than what automatic evaluations indicate. Additionally, we analyze specific instances of false positives and discuss potential limitations in self-improvement techniques and synthetic data generation under such conditions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiquan Qiu, You Wu, Dong Li, Jianmin Guo, Quanming Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Model merging enables powerful capabilities in neural networks without requiring additional training. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on model merging by leveraging the fundamental mechanisms of neural network representation. Our approach is motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, which states that neural networks encode information through linear combinations of feature vectors. We propose a method that superposes task-specific features from individual models into a merged model. Our approach specifically targets linear transformation matrices, which are crucial for feature activation and extraction in deep networks. By formulating the merging process as a linear system, we can preserve task-specific features from individual models and create merged models that effectively maintain multi-task capabilities compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques. Code is available at https://github.com/LARS-research/STF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Parekh, Yuxuan Dong, Lucas Bandarkar, Artin Kim, I-Hung Hsu, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Event Detection (ED) -- the task of identifying event mentions from natural language text -- is critical for enabling reasoning in highly specialized domains such as biomedicine, law, and epidemiology. Data generation has proven to be effective in broadening its utility to wider applications without requiring expensive expert annotations. However, when existing generation approaches are applied to specialized domains, they struggle with label noise, where annotations are incorrect, and domain drift, characterized by a distributional mismatch between generated sentences and the target domain. To address these issues, we introduce SNaRe, a domain-aware synthetic data generation framework composed of three components: Scout, Narrator, and Refiner. Scout extracts triggers from unlabeled target domain data and curates a high-quality domain-specific trigger list using corpus-level statistics to mitigate domain drift. Narrator, conditioned on these triggers, generates high-quality domain-aligned sentences, and Refiner identifies additional event mentions, ensuring high annotation quality. Experimentation on three diverse domain ED datasets reveals how SNaRe outperforms the best baseline, achieving average F1 gains of 3-7% in the zero-shot/few-shot settings and 4-20% F1 improvement for multilingual generation. Analyzing the generated trigger hit rate and human evaluation substantiates SNaRe's stronger annotation quality and reduced domain drift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bingxuan Li, Yiwei Wang, Jiuxiang Gu, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Chart generation aims to generate code to produce charts satisfying the desired visual properties, e.g., texts, layout, color, and type. It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves 5.2% improvement over the current best result in the chart generation task. The METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens. In addition, we find that separating different modalities during the critique process of METAL boosts the self-correction capability of VLMs in the multimodal context.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Liu, Haipeng Liu, Haichao Liu, Xin Liu, Jinxin Ni, Jun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Human drivers adeptly navigate complex scenarios by utilizing rich attentional semantics, but the current autonomous systems struggle to replicate this ability, as they often lose critical semantic information when converting 2D observations into 3D space. In this sense, it hinders their effective deployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by providing attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the model to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the driver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E better aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for navigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality importance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach dynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that the complementary information from visual and textual modalities is effectively utilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our method facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving environments. We evaluate VLM-E2E on the nuScenes dataset and achieve significant improvements in perception, prediction, and planning over the baseline end-to-end model, showcasing the effectiveness of our attention-enhanced BEV representation in enabling more accurate and reliable autonomous driving tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenjun Li, Laurin Lux, Alexander H. Berger, Martin J. Menten, Mert R. Sabuncu, Johannes C. Paetzold</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate staging of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is essential for guiding timely interventions and preventing vision loss. However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth Mieczkowski, Ruaridh Mon-Williams, Neil Bramley, Christopher G. Lucas, Natalia Velez, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: When should we encourage specialization in multi-agent systems versus train generalists that perform the entire task independently? We propose that specialization largely depends on task parallelizability: the potential for multiple agents to execute task components concurrently. Drawing inspiration from Amdahl's Law in distributed systems, we present a closed-form bound that predicts when specialization improves performance, depending only on task concurrency and team size. We validate our model on two standard MARL benchmarks that represent opposite regimes -- StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC, unlimited concurrency) and Multi-Particle Environment (MPE, unit-capacity bottlenecks) -- and observe close alignment between the bound at each extreme and an empirical measure of specialization. Three follow-up experiments in Overcooked-AI demonstrate that the model works in environments with more complex spatial and resource bottlenecks that allow for a range of strategies. Beyond prediction, the bound also serves as a diagnostic tool, highlighting biases in MARL training algorithms that cause sub-optimal convergence to specialist strategies with larger state spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Saif Nazir, Chayan Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) often struggles with reward misalignment, where agents optimize given rewards but fail to exhibit the desired behaviors. This arises when the reward function incentivizes proxy behaviors misaligned with the true objective. While human-in-the-loop (HITL) methods can mitigate this issue, they also introduce biases, leading to inconsistent and subjective feedback that complicates learning. To address these challenges, we propose two key contributions. First, we extend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for reward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control tasks. Using LLMs as direct feedback providers eliminates the need for surrogate models trained on human feedback, which often inherit biases from training data. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework (LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback while incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF framework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the limitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human supervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging and correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and reduces reliance on potentially biased human feedback. Empirical experiments show that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with Average Episodic Reward dropping by nearly 94% compared to unbiased approaches. In contrast, LLM-based methods sustain performance at a similar level to unbiased feedback, even in challenging edge-case scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feijiang Han, Hengtao Cui, Licheng Guo, Zelong Wang, Zhiyuan Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on complex reasoning tasks due to flawed question comprehension, not just flawed logic. This paper presents a systematic investigation into these comprehension failures. Our work yields three key insights: (1) the step-by-step principle, effective for calculation, can be migrated to the reading process to enhance comprehension; (2) increasing the proportion of question-related tokens (e.g., via repetition) succeeds by refocusing attention, a mechanism that can be explicitly controlled; and (3) backward dependencies represent a core bottleneck for decoder-only models that persists even with strong methods like Chain-of-Thought. Based on these findings, we introduce the Step-by-Step Reading (SSR) family of prompts. This multi-stage approach culminates in SSR++, a method specifically engineered to deepen model comprehension by guiding it to parse questions with finer granularity, focus attention on critical tokens, and resolve backward dependencies through iterative re-contextualization. SSR++ sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple reasoning benchmarks, and our analysis confirms it works by directly mitigating semantic misunderstanding. These results demonstrate that guiding how a model reads is a powerful and efficient method for improving its reasoning ability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Fahimuzzman Sohan, Raid Alzubi, Hadeel Alzoubi, Eid Albalawi, A. H. Abdul Hafez</p>
<p>Abstract: Cattle lameness is a prevalent health problem in livestock farming, often resulting from hoof injuries or infections, and severely impacts animal welfare and productivity. Early and accurate detection is critical for minimizing economic losses and ensuring proper treatment. This study proposes a spatiotemporal deep learning framework for automated cattle lameness detection using publicly available video data. We curate and publicly release a balanced set of 50 online video clips featuring 42 individual cattle, recorded from multiple viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor environments. The videos were categorized into lame and non-lame classes based on visual gait characteristics and metadata descriptions. After applying data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization, two deep learning architectures were trained and evaluated: 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) and Convolutional Long-Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM2D). The 3D CNN achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with a precision, recall, and F1 score of 90.9% each, outperforming the ConvLSTM2D model, which achieved 85% accuracy. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on multistage pipelines involving object detection and pose estimation, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a direct end-to-end video classification approach. Compared with the best end-to-end prior method (C3D-ConvLSTM, 90.3%), our model achieves comparable accuracy while eliminating pose estimation pre-processing.The results indicate that deep learning models can successfully extract and learn spatio-temporal features from various video sources, enabling scalable and efficient cattle lameness detection in real-world farm settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wang, Haoyang Li, Haibo Chen, Zeyang Zhang, Wenwu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine learning research, including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in explainability, reliability, adaptability, and extensibility. In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingjie Zheng, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Giwon Hong, Xuanli He, Pasquale Minervini, Youcheng Sun, Qiongkai Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge from retrieved documents, thereby overcoming the limitations of models' static intrinsic knowledge. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that manipulate the retrieval process by introducing documents that are adversarial yet semantically similar to the query. Notably, while these adversarial documents resemble the query, they exhibit weak similarity to benign documents in the retrieval set. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective Graph-based Reranking against Adversarial Document Attacks (GRADA) framework aiming at preserving retrieval quality while significantly reducing the success of adversaries. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of our approach through experiments conducted on five LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Llama3.1-70b, and Qwen2.5-7b. We use three datasets to assess performance, with results from the Natural Questions dataset demonstrating up to an 80% reduction in attack success rates while maintaining minimal loss in accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao Amber Hu, Yuhan Liu, Helena Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents) combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgents eliminate centralized control and reduce human intervention, addressing key trust concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. This contributes to social computing by enabling new human cooperative paradigm "intelligence as commons." However, given ongoing challenges in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts, founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the future agentic web.</p>

<p>Abstract: We address the problem of detecting anomalies as samples that do not conform to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. To this end, we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective disaster management requires timely access to accurate and contextually relevant information. Existing Information Retrieval (IR) benchmarks, however, focus primarily on general or specialized domains, such as medicine or finance, neglecting the unique linguistic complexity and diverse information needs encountered in disaster management scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce DisastIR, the first comprehensive IR evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for disaster management. DisastIR comprises 9,600 diverse user queries and more than 1.3 million labeled query-passage pairs, covering 48 distinct retrieval tasks derived from six search intents and eight general disaster categories that include 301 specific event types. Our evaluations of 30 state-of-the-art retrieval models demonstrate significant performance variances across tasks, with no single model excelling universally. Furthermore, comparative analyses reveal significant performance gaps between general-domain and disaster management-specific tasks, highlighting the necessity of disaster management-specific benchmarks for guiding IR model selection to support effective decision-making in disaster management scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenzhuo Zhao, Ziqian Liu, Xinda Wang, Junting Lu, Chaoyi Ruan</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt optimization is a practical and widely applicable alternative to fine tuning for improving large language model performance. Yet many existing methods evaluate candidate prompts by sampling full outputs, often coupled with self critique or human annotated preferences, which limits scalability, especially for smaller models or models that are not instruction tuned. We present PMPO (Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that uses token level cross entropy as a direct, lightweight evaluation signal. PMPO locates low quality prompt segments via a masking based analysis and iteratively rewrites them to propose improved variants. Crucially, during evaluation, PMPO selects among variants by minimizing loss in a single forward pass, eliminating output sampling and human or judge based scoring for selection while still using standard generation only to propose rewrites. This unified, loss based strategy supports both supervised and preference based tasks. Across model sizes and datasets, PMPO outperforms prior prompt optimizers: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH, performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA RAT, and raises AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates by over 19 points. These results demonstrate PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency, and broad applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Y. Sakabe, Felipe S. Abrah\~ao, Alexandre Sim\~oes, Esther Colombini, Paula Costa, Ricardo Gudwin, Hector Zenil</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fraud detection remains a critical task in high-stakes domains such as finance and e-commerce, where undetected fraudulent transactions can lead to significant economic losses. In this study, we systematically compare the performance of four supervised learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network - on a large-scale, highly imbalanced online transaction dataset. While ensemble methods such as Random Forest and LightGBM demonstrated superior performance in both overall and class-specific metrics, Logistic Regression offered a reliable and interpretable baseline. The GRU model showed strong recall for the minority fraud class, though at the cost of precision, highlighting a trade-off relevant for real-world deployment. Our evaluation emphasizes not only weighted averages but also per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores, providing a nuanced view of each model's effectiveness in detecting rare but consequential fraudulent activity. The findings underscore the importance of choosing models based on the specific risk tolerance and operational needs of fraud detection systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Zhan, Shixin Zhou, Qianqian Yang, Yixuan Zhao, Hao Liu, Srinivas Chowdary Ramineni, Kenji Shimada</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Parekh, Kartik Mehta, Ninareh Mehrabi, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in natural language text without any training data, is critical for document understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology, extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery, which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding. Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision. Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Sun, Yifan Liu, Ahmed Al-Tahmeesschi, Swarna Chetty, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi, Avishek Nag, Hamed Ahmadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL) framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular networks, built upon a near-real-time RAN intelligent controller. By integrating a feature-based approach that leverages Shapley values and an attention mechanism, we interpret and refine the decisions of our reinforcementlearning agents, addressing key reliability challenges in vehicular communication systems. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach provides clear, real-time insights into the resource allocation process and achieves higher interpretability precision than a pure attention mechanism. Furthermore, the Quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction for URLLC services increased from 78.0% to 80.13%, while that for eMBB services improved from 71.44% to 73.21%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Toufique Hasan, Muhammad Waseem, Kai-Kristian Kemell, Ayman Asad Khan, Mika Saari, Pekka Abrahamsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs. A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii) Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshay Paruchuri, Maryam Aziz, Rohit Vartak, Ayman Ali, Best Uchehara, Xin Liu, Ishan Chatterjee, Monica Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs deployed as conversational AI.

<p>Abstract: The widespread deployment of Deep Learning-based Face Recognition Systems raises multiple security concerns. While prior research has identified backdoor vulnerabilities on isolated components, Backdoor Attacks on real-world, unconstrained pipelines remain underexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive system-level analysis of Backdoor Attacks targeting Face Recognition Systems and provides three contributions. We first show that face feature extractors trained with large margin metric learning losses are susceptible to Backdoor Attacks. By analyzing 20 pipeline configurations and 15 attack scenarios, we then reveal that a single backdoor can compromise an entire Face Recognition System. Finally, we propose effective best practices and countermeasures for stakeholders.</p>

Chaudhari</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a novel, self-supervised, data-efficient distillation method that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset of 840 physician-annotated outputs across 6 diverse medical tasks capturing real-world challenges. Across 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source and proprietary models, MedVAL distillation significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians across seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%. Despite strong baseline performance, MedVAL improves the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8% without training on physician-labeled data, demonstrating a performance statistically non-inferior to a single human expert (p < 0.001). To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source: 1) Codebase (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench), 3) MedVAL-4B (https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B). Our benchmark provides evidence of LMs approaching expert-level ability in validating AI-generated medical text.</p>

<p>Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for detection tasks in DM and DBT.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwon Kim, Kyoungoh Lee, Jeyoun Dong, Jung Hwan Ahn, Kwang-Ju Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable decision-making through explicit, human-understandable concepts. However, existing generative CBMs often rely on auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck, which undermines interpretability and intervention capabilities. We propose EnCoBo, a post-hoc concept bottleneck for generative models that eliminates auxiliary cues by constraining all representations to flow solely through explicit concepts. Unlike autoencoder-based approaches that inherently rely on black-box decoders, EnCoBo leverages a decoder-free, energy-based framework that directly guides generation in the latent space. Guided by diffusion-scheduled energy functions, EnCoBo supports robust post-hoc interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary concepts. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and CUB datasets showed that EnCoBo improved concept-level human intervention and interpretability while maintaining competitive visual quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Jiang, Zehua Chen, Zeqian Ju, Chang Li, Weibei Dou, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency. Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis.

<p>Abstract: High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around \$100,000 (manual annotation) to just \$5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Pin Huang, Yueh-Hua Wu, Min-Hung Chen, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Fu-En Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeongun Ryu, Heon Song, Seungeun Lee, Soo Ick Cho, Jiwon Shin, Kyunghyun Paeng, S\'ergio Pereira</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.</p>

<p>Abstract: The discourse on responsible artificial intelligence (AI) regulation is understandably dominated by risk-focused assessments and analyses. This approach reflects the fundamental uncertainty policymakers face when determining appropriate responses to current, emerging and novel AI systems. In this article, we argue that by operationalising the concept of freedom - the philosophical counterpart to responsibility - a complementary approach centred on the potential societal benefits of AI systems can be developed. The result is a discursive framework grounded in freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity, which represent the two main intellectual traditions of interpreting freedom. We contend that the complexity, ambiguity and contestation involved in regulating AI systems make a deliberative paradigm more useful than the conventional technical one. The resulting framework is structured around coordinative, communicative and decision spaces, each with sequential focal points and associated outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenshan Xie, Levente Baljer, M. Jorge Cardoso, Emma Robinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment, increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit 3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the 3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes. Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p>

Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on examples from the medical and industrial fields where interpretability has tangible value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Denisa Martonov\'a, Alain Goriely, Ellen Kuhl</p>
<p>Abstract: The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches, capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code. However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI-assisted programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Moreover, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation and help developers identify the most suitable models for practical tasks. They also lay the groundwork for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zinan Tang, Xin Gao, Qizhi Pei, Zhuoshi Pan, Mengzhang Cai, Jiang Wu, Conghui He, Lijun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

<p>Abstract: Mitotic figures are classified into typical and atypical variants, with atypical counts correlating strongly with tumor aggressiveness. Accurate differentiation is therefore essential for patient prognostication and resource allocation, yet remains challenging even for expert pathologists. Here, we leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large histopathology datasets and applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation. In addition, we incorporated ConvNeXt V2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to complement PFMs. During training, we employed a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving competitive balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Zeng, Tiehang Xu, Qiao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional neural networks struggle to capture the spectral structure of complex signals. Fourier neural networks (FNNs) attempt to address this by embedding Fourier series components, yet many real-world signals are almost-periodic with non-commensurate frequencies, posing additional challenges. Building on prior work showing that ARIMA outperforms large language models (LLMs) for forecasting, we extend the comparison to neural predictors and find ARIMA still superior. We therefore propose the Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AR-KAN), which integrates a pre-trained AR module for temporal memory with a KAN for nonlinear representation. The AR module preserves essential temporal features while reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that AR-KAN matches ARIMA on almost-periodic functions and achieves the best results on $72\%$ of Rdatasets series, with a clear advantage on data with periodic structure. These results highlight AR-KAN as a robust and effective framework for time series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Wu, Shreya Saha, Yiqing Bo, Meenakshi Khosla</p>
<p>Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchong Xie, Mingyu Luo, Zesen Liu, Zhixiang Zhang, Kaikai Zhang, Yu Liu, Zongjie Li, Ping Chen, Shuai Wang, Dongdong She</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julio Zanon Diaz, Georgios Siogkas, Peter Corcoran</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated visual inspection in medical device manufacturing faces unique challenges, including small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and strict regulatory requirements. To address these, we propose two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection. The first employs a structural similarity-based scoring approach that enables lightweight, real-time defect detection with unsupervised thresholding and can be further enhanced through limited supervised tuning. The second applies a feature distance-based strategy using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, designed to monitor distributional shifts and support supervisory oversight. Evaluations on a representative sterile packaging dataset confirm that both approaches outperform baselines under hardware-constrained, regulated conditions. Cross-domain testing on the MVTec-Zipper benchmark further demonstrates that the structural similarity-based method generalises effectively and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while the feature distance-based method is less transferable but provides complementary monitoring capabilities. These results highlight a dual-pathway inspection strategy: structural similarity for robust inline detection and feature distance for supervisory monitoring. By combining operational performance with interpretability and lifecycle monitoring, the proposed methods also align with emerging regulatory expectations for high-risk AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muraam Abdel-Ghani, Mahmoud Ali, Mohamed Ali, Fatmaelzahraa Ahmed, Muhammad Arsalan, Abdulaziz Al-Ali, Shidin Balakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream, for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jisung Hwang, Jaihoon Kim, Minhyuk Sung</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity, encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Xie, Trevor Darrell, Luke Zettlemoyer, XuDong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liangjin Liu, Haoyang Zheng, Zhengzhong Zhu, Pei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods, often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. The architecture processes these streams through specialized networks: a topology-aware graph convolution models the view-invariant shape from a wrist-centric frame, while a Finsler geometry-based encoder captures the context-aware trajectory from a facial-centric frame. These features are then integrated via a geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97%, and 99.79% accuracy on the challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300, and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters than competing models.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai R. Larsen, Sen Yan, Roland M. Mueller, Lan Sang, Mikko R\"onkk\"o, Ravi Starzl, Donald Edmondson</p>
<p>Abstract: Psychological measurement is critical to many disciplines. Despite advances in measurement, building nomological networks, theoretical maps of how concepts and measures relate to establish validity, remains a challenge 70 years after Cronbach and Meehl proposed them as fundamental to validation. This limitation has practical consequences: clinical trials may fail to detect treatment effects, and public policy may target the wrong outcomes. We introduce Analysis of Latent Indicators to Generate Nomological Structures (ALIGNS), a large language model-based system trained with validated questionnaire measures. ALIGNS provides three comprehensive nomological networks containing over 550,000 indicators across psychology, medicine, social policy, and other fields. This represents the first application of large language models to solve a foundational problem in measurement validation. We report classification accuracy tests used to develop the model, as well as three evaluations. In the first evaluation, the widely used NIH PROMIS anxiety and depression instruments are shown to converge into a single dimension of emotional distress. The second evaluation examines child temperament measures and identifies four potential dimensions not captured by current frameworks, and questions one existing dimension. The third evaluation, an applicability check, engages expert psychometricians who assess the system's importance, accessibility, and suitability. ALIGNS is freely available at nomologicalnetwork.org, complementing traditional validation methods with large-scale nomological analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach, EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches, offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other high-stakes domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Wang, Xiaofei Xie, Qiang Hu, Shangqing Liu, Yi Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid progress of large audio-language models (LALMs), audio question answering (AQA) has emerged as a challenging task requiring both fine-grained audio understanding and complex reasoning. While current methods mainly rely on constructing new datasets via captioning or reasoning traces, existing high-quality AQA data remains underutilized. To address this, we propose Omni-CLST, an error-aware Curriculum Learning framework with guided Selective Chain-of-Thought. The framework efficiently leverages existing high-quality dataset through two key strategies: an error-aware curriculum that organizes samples by difficulty, and a guided thought dropout mechanism that focuses reasoning on challenging cases. Experiments show that Omni-CLST achieves 73.80% on MMAU-mini and a new state of the art of 64.30% on MMAR, demonstrating robust generalization in multimodal audio-language understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks, they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in practical settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Interpreting the massive volume of security alerts is a significant challenge in Security Operations Centres (SOCs). Effective contextualisation is important, enabling quick distinction between genuine threats and benign activity to prioritise what needs further analysis. This paper proposes a graph-based approach to enhance alert contextualisation in a SOC by aggregating alerts into graph-based alert groups, where nodes represent alerts and edges denote relationships within defined time-windows. By grouping related alerts, we enable analysis at a higher abstraction level, capturing attack steps more effectively than individual alerts. Furthermore, to show that our format is well suited for downstream machine learning methods, we employ Graph Matching Networks (GMNs) to correlate incoming alert groups with historical incidents, providing analysts with additional insights.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin J. Walker, Nikoleta Kalaydzhieva, Beatriz Navarro Lameda, Ruth A. Reynolds</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are transforming the educational landscape, prompting reconsideration of traditional assessment practices. In parallel, universities are exploring alternatives to in-person, closed-book examinations, raising concerns about academic integrity and pedagogical alignment in uninvigilated settings. This study investigates whether traditional closed-book mathematics examinations retain their pedagogical relevance when hypothetically administered in uninvigilated, open-book settings with GenAI access. Adopting an empirical approach, we generate, transcribe, and blind-mark GenAI submissions to eight undergraduate mathematics examinations at a Russel Group university, spanning the entirety of the first-year curriculum. By combining independent GenAI responses to individual questions, we enable a meaningful evaluation of GenAI performance, both at the level of modules and across the first-year curriculum. We find that GenAI attainment is at the level of a first-class degree, though current performance can vary between modules. Further, we find that GenAI performance is remarkably consistent when viewed across the entire curriculum, significantly more so than that of students in invigilated examinations. Our findings evidence the need for redesigning assessments in mathematics for unsupervised settings, and highlight the potential reduction in pedagogical value of current standards in the era of generative artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamie Cummins</p>
<p>Abstract: Social scientists are now using large language models to create "silicon samples" - synthetic datasets intended to stand in for human respondents, aimed at revolutionising human subjects research. However, there are many analytic choices which must be made to produce these samples. Though many of these choices are defensible, their impact on sample quality is poorly understood. I map out these analytic choices and demonstrate how a very small number of decisions can dramatically change the correspondence between silicon samples and human data. Configurations (N = 252) varied substantially in their capacity to estimate (i) rank ordering of participants, (ii) response distributions, and (iii) between-scale correlations. Most critically, configurations were not consistent in quality: those that performed well on one dimension often performed poorly on another, implying that there is no "one-size-fits-all" configuration that optimises the accuracy of these samples. I call for greater attention to the threat of analytic flexibility in using silicon samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vani Kanjirangat, Ljiljana Dolamic, Fabio Rinaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper discusses our exploration of different data-efficient and parameter-efficient approaches to Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). In particular, we investigate various soft-prompting strategies, including prefix-tuning, prompt-tuning, P-tuning, and P-tuning V2, as well as LoRA reparameterizations. For the data-efficient strategy, we analyze hard prompting with zero-shot and few-shot inferences to analyze the dialect identification capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). For the parameter-efficient PEFT approaches, we conducted our experiments using Arabic-specific encoder models on several major datasets. We also analyzed the n-shot inferences on open-source decoder-only models, a general multilingual model (Phi-3.5), and an Arabic-specific one(SILMA). We observed that the LLMs generally struggle to differentiate the dialectal nuances in the few-shot or zero-shot setups. The soft-prompted encoder variants perform better, while the LoRA-based fine-tuned models perform best, even surpassing full fine-tuning.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13789">BWCache: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers through Block-Wise Caching</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanshuai Cui, Zhiqing Tang, Zhifei Xu, Zhi Yao, Wenyi Zeng, Weijia Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14057">Machines are more productive than humans until they aren&#x27;t, and vice versa</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Zanardelli</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growth of artificial skills, organizations may increasingly confront with the problem of optimizing skill policy decisions guided by economic principles. This paper addresses the underlying complexity of this challenge by developing an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical realism to analyze the economic impact of human and machine skills, individually or jointly deployed, in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results provide quantitative support for the established notions that automation tends to be the most economically-effective strategy for tasks characterized by low-to-medium generalization difficulty, while automation may struggle to match the economic utility of human skills in more complex scenarios. Critically, our simulations highlight that combining human and machine skills can be the most effective strategy when a high level of generalization is required, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine policy is severely penalized by the inherent costs of its dual skill structure, causing it to destroy value and becoming the worst choice from an economic perspective. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: in contexts requiring high generalization capabilities, simply allocating human and machine skills to a task is insufficient, and a human-machine skill policy is neither a silver-bullet solution nor a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichao Zhang, Wenhao Chai, Shwai He, Ang Li, Yun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.</p>
