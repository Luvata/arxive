<p><b>Authors:</b> Yonghao Zhao, Changtao Li, Chi Shu, Qingbin Wu, Hong Li, Chuan Xu, Tianrui Li, Ziqiang Wang, Zhipeng Luo, Yazhou He</p>
<p>Abstract: Survival prognosis is crucial for medical informatics. Practitioners often confront small-sized clinical data, especially cancer patient cases, which can be insufficient to induce useful patterns for survival predictions. This study deals with small sample survival analysis by leveraging transfer learning, a useful machine learning technique that can enhance the target analysis with related knowledge pre-learned from other data. We propose and develop various transfer learning methods designed for common survival models. For parametric models such as DeepSurv, Cox-CC (Cox-based neural networks), and DeepHit (end-to-end deep learning model), we apply standard transfer learning techniques like pretraining and fine-tuning. For non-parametric models such as Random Survival Forest, we propose a new transfer survival forest (TSF) model that transfers tree structures from source tasks and fine-tunes them with target data. We evaluated the transfer learning methods on colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. The source data are 27,379 SEER CRC stage I patients, and the target data are 728 CRC stage I patients from the West China Hospital. When enhanced by transfer learning, Cox-CC's $C^{td}$ value was boosted from 0.7868 to 0.8111, DeepHit's from 0.8085 to 0.8135, DeepSurv's from 0.7722 to 0.8043, and RSF's from 0.7940 to 0.8297 (the highest performance). All models trained with data as small as 50 demonstrated even more significant improvement. Conclusions: Therefore, the current survival models used for cancer prognosis can be enhanced and improved by properly designed transfer learning techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunjee Choi, Junhyun Ahn, XinYu Piao, Jong-Kook Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Fake News Detection has received increasing attention recently. Existing methods rely on independently encoded unimodal data and overlook the advantages of capturing intra-modality relationships and integrating inter-modal similarities using advanced techniques. To address these issues, Cross-Modal Tri-Transformer and Metric Learning for Multimodal Fake News Detection (CroMe) is proposed. CroMe utilizes Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models (BLIP2) as encoders to capture detailed text, image and combined image-text representations. The metric learning module employs a proxy anchor method to capture intra-modality relationships while the feature fusion module uses a Cross-Modal and Tri-Transformer for effective integration. The final fake news detector processes the fused features through a classifier to predict the authenticity of the content. Experiments on datasets show that CroMe excels in multimodal fake news detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanmin Wang, Chengguang Liu, Qingshan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) identifies individuals' sentiment states in videos by integrating visual, audio, and text modalities. Despite progress in existing methods, the inherent modality heterogeneity limits the effective capture of interactive sentiment features across modalities. In this paper, by introducing a Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning (MMCL) framework, we facilitate cross-modal interactions and capture enhanced and complementary features from modality-common and modality-specific representations, respectively. Specifically, we design a parameter-free decoupling module and separate uni-modality into modality-common and modality-specific components through semantics assessment of cross-modal elements. For modality-specific representations, inspired by the act-reward mechanism in reinforcement learning, we design policy models to adaptively mine complementary sentiment features under the guidance of a joint reward. For modality-common representations, intra-modal attention is employed to highlight crucial components, playing enhanced roles among modalities. Experimental results, including superiority evaluations on four databases, effectiveness verification of each module, and assessment of complementary features, demonstrate that MMCL successfully learns collaborative features across modalities and significantly improves performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aoxiang Ma, Salah Ghamizi, Jun Cao, Pedro Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning (ML) techniques gain prominence in power system research, validating these methods' effectiveness under real-world conditions requires real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. HIL simulation platforms enable the integration of computational models with physical devices, allowing rigorous testing across diverse scenarios critical to system resilience and reliability. In this study, we develop a SafePowerGraph-HIL framework that utilizes HIL simulations on the IEEE 9-bus system, modeled in Hypersim, to generate high-fidelity data, which is then transmitted in real-time via SCADA to an AWS cloud database before being input into a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model designed for power system state estimation and dynamic analysis. By leveraging Hypersim's capabilities, we simulate complex grid interactions, providing a robust dataset that captures critical parameters for HGNN training. The trained HGNN is subsequently validated using newly generated data under varied system conditions, demonstrating accuracy and robustness in predicting power system states. The results underscore the potential of integrating HIL with advanced neural network architectures to enhance the real-time operational capabilities of power systems. This approach represents a significant advancement toward the development of intelligent, adaptive control strategies that support the robustness and resilience of evolving power grids.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12428">SplitQuant: Layer Splitting for Low-Bit Neural Network Quantization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaewoo Song, Fangzhen Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantization for deep neural networks (DNNs) is the process of mapping the parameter values of DNNs from original data types to other data types of lower precision to reduce model sizes and make inference faster. Quantization often maps different original values to a single quantized value because the range of the original values is larger than the range of the quantized values. This leads to the degradation of the accuracy of the quantized DNNs. Outliers are a main cause of the degradation of quantization resolution because they enlarge the range of original values. To solve the problem, the percentile method is often used to clip outliers. However, clipping the outliers has another problem of removing the important and strong signals in the DNNs. This paper proposes SplitQuant to keep the outliers and improve the quantization resolution at the same time. SplitQuant narrows down the range of the original values and mitigates the effect of outliers by splitting each quantizable layer into three mathematically equivalent layers and applies different scaling factors. Especially, weights and biases are clustered into lower, middle and upper clusters for optimized split. By preprocessing DNNs with SplitQuant, quantization algorithms can achieve better results. SplitQuant was applied on two BERT-Tiny models and improved the accuracy of INT2 quantization by 3.3%p and 2.1%p, achieving accuracies comparable to those of the original FP32 models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng Ma, Bo N{\o}rregaard J{\o}rgensen, Zheng Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Public transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the need to improve bus fuel efficiency. Clustering algorithms assist in analyzing fuel efficiency by grouping data into clusters, but irrelevant features may complicate the analysis and choosing the optimal number of clusters remains a challenging task. Therefore, this paper employs the Gaussian mixture models to cluster the solo fuel-efficiency dataset. Moreover, an integration method that combines the Silhouette index, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index is developed to select the optimal cluster numbers. A dataset with 4006 bus trips in North Jutland, Denmark is utilized as the case study. Trips are first split into three groups, then one group is divided further, resulting in four categories: extreme, normal, low, and extremely low fuel efficiency. A preliminary study using visualization analysis is conducted to investigate how driving behaviors and route conditions affect fuel efficiency. The results indicate that both individual driving habits and route characteristics have a significant influence on fuel efficiency.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12430">SCFCRC: Simultaneously Counteract Feature Camouflage and Relation Camouflage for Fraud Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaocheng Zhang, Zhuangzhuang Ye, GuoPing Zhao, Jianing Wang, Xiaohong Su</p>
<p>Abstract: In fraud detection, fraudsters often interact with many benign users, camouflaging their features or relations to hide themselves. Most existing work concentrates solely on either feature camouflage or relation camouflage, or decoupling feature learning and relation learning to avoid the two camouflage from affecting each other. However, this inadvertently neglects the valuable information derived from features or relations, which could mutually enhance their adversarial camouflage strategies. In response to this gap, we propose SCFCRC, a Transformer-based fraud detector that Simultaneously Counteract Feature Camouflage and Relation Camouflage. SCFCRC consists of two components: Feature Camouflage Filter and Relation Camouflage Refiner. The feature camouflage filter utilizes pseudo labels generated through label propagation to train the filter and uses contrastive learning that combines instance-wise and prototype-wise to improve the quality of features. The relation camouflage refiner uses Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) network to disassemble the multi-relations graph into multiple substructures and divide and conquer them to mitigate the degradation of detection performance caused by relation camouflage. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization method for MoE to enhance the robustness of the model. Extensive experiments on two fraud detection benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12431">Modality Interactive Mixture-of-Experts for Fake News Detection</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Liu, Yaokun Liu, Zelin Li, Ruichen Yao, Yang Zhang, Dong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, eroding trust, exacerbating inequality, and amplifying harmful narratives. Detecting fake news in multimodal contexts -- where deceptive content combines text and images -- is particularly challenging due to the nuanced interplay between modalities. Existing multimodal fake news detection methods often emphasize cross-modal consistency but ignore the complex interactions between text and visual elements, which may complement, contradict, or independently influence the predicted veracity of a post. To address these challenges, we present Modality Interactive Mixture-of-Experts for Fake News Detection (MIMoE-FND), a novel hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts framework designed to enhance multimodal fake news detection by explicitly modeling modality interactions through an interaction gating mechanism. Our approach models modality interactions by evaluating two key aspects of modality interactions: unimodal prediction agreement and semantic alignment. The hierarchical structure of MIMoE-FND allows for distinct learning pathways tailored to different fusion scenarios, adapting to the unique characteristics of each modality interaction. By tailoring fusion strategies to diverse modality interaction scenarios, MIMoE-FND provides a more robust and nuanced approach to multimodal fake news detection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world benchmarks spanning two languages, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. By enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of fake news detection, MIMoE-FND offers a promising tool to mitigate the spread of misinformation, with the potential to better safeguard vulnerable communities against its harmful effects.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12432">Divide-Then-Aggregate: An Efficient Tool Learning Method via Parallel Tool Invocation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongsheng Zhu, Weixian Shi, Zhengliang Shi, Zhaochun Ren, Shuaiqiang Wang, Lingyong Yan, Dawei Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: Although current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, performing complex real-world tasks still requires tool learning. Mainstream methods, such as CoT/ReAct, rely on step-by-step tool invocation to interact with external environments, but they are limited in perceptual scope and lack adequate task-planning capability. To address these limitations, other studies introduce the first Search-based Decision Tree (DFSDT), which still suffers from the high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel parallel tool invocation paradigm, DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama). First, we transform traditional tree-based tool search paths into Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, generating a high-quality parallel tool invocation dataset. The DTA-Llama is then trained on the dataset to learn to iteratively divide the current task into several parallel tool invocation sub-tasks and aggregate the invocation results to decide the next actions. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient inference framework inspired by the Process/Threads mechanism when applying the DTA-Llama to practical tasks. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5. The relevant code, dataset, and model weights are available at https://corn0205.github.io/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Zhuang, Qian Zhang, Ying Qian</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrosynthesis plays a crucial role in the fields of organic synthesis and drug development, where the goal is to identify suitable reactants that can yield a target product molecule. Although existing methods have achieved notable success, they typically overlook the 3D conformational details and internal spatial organization of molecules. This oversight makes it challenging to predict reactants that conform to genuine chemical principles, particularly when dealing with complex molecular structures, such as polycyclic and heteroaromatic compounds. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel transformer-based, template-free approach that incorporates 3D conformer data and spatial information. Our approach includes an Atom-align Fusion module that integrates 3D positional data at the input stage, ensuring correct alignment between atom tokens and their respective 3D coordinates. Additionally, we propose a Distance-weighted Attention mechanism that refines the self-attention process, constricting the model s focus to relevant atom pairs in 3D space. Extensive experiments on the USPTO-50K dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms previous template-free methods, setting a new benchmark for the field. A case study further highlights our method s ability to predict reasonable and accurate reactants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubhi Asthana, Ruchi Mahindru, Bing Zhang, Jorge Sanz</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces growing challenges from evolving data protection laws and enforcement practices worldwide. Regulations like GDPR and CCPA impose strict compliance requirements on Machine Learning (ML) models, especially concerning personal data use. These laws grant individuals rights such as data correction and deletion, complicating the training and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on extensive datasets. Public data availability does not guarantee its lawful use for ML, amplifying these challenges.
  This paper introduces an adaptive system for mitigating risk of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) in LLMs. It dynamically aligns with diverse regulatory frameworks and integrates seamlessly into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) systems. The system uses advanced NLP techniques, context-aware analysis, and policy-driven masking to ensure regulatory compliance.
  Benchmarks highlight the system's effectiveness, with an F1 score of 0.95 for Passport Numbers, outperforming tools like Microsoft Presidio (0.33) and Amazon Comprehend (0.54). In human evaluations, the system achieved an average user trust score of 4.6/5, with participants acknowledging its accuracy and transparency. Observations demonstrate stricter anonymization under GDPR compared to CCPA, which permits pseudonymization and user opt-outs. These results validate the system as a scalable and robust solution for enterprise privacy compliance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tian Jin, Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun, Utku Evci, Suvinay Subramanian, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Dan Alistarh, Gintare Karolina Dziugaite</p>
<p>Abstract: Pruning eliminates unnecessary parameters in neural networks; it offers a promising solution to the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs). While many focus on post-training pruning, sparse pre-training--which combines pruning and pre-training into a single phase--provides a simpler alternative. In this work, we present the first systematic exploration of optimal sparse pre-training configurations for LLMs through an examination of 80 unique pruning schedules across different sparsity levels and training durations. We find that initiating pruning at 25% of total training compute and concluding at 75% achieves near-optimal final evaluation loss. These findings provide valuable insights for efficient and effective sparse pre-training of LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new scaling law that modifies the Chinchilla scaling law to use the average parameter count over pre-training. Through empirical and theoretical validation, we demonstrate that this modified scaling law accurately models evaluation loss for both sparsely and densely pre-trained LLMs, unifying scaling laws across pre-training paradigms. Our findings indicate that while sparse pre-training achieves the same final model quality as dense pre-training for equivalent compute budgets, it provides substantial benefits through reduced model size, enabling significant potential computational savings during inference.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12500">Identification of Nonparametric Dynamic Causal Structure and Latent Process in Climate System</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghao Fu, Biwei Huang, Zijian Li, Yujia Zheng, Ignavier Ng, Yingyao Hu, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The study of learning causal structure with latent variables has advanced the understanding of the world by uncovering causal relationships and latent factors, e.g., Causal Representation Learning (CRL). However, in real-world scenarios, such as those in climate systems, causal relationships are often nonparametric, dynamic, and exist among both observed variables and latent variables. These challenges motivate us to consider a general setting in which causal relations are nonparametric and unrestricted in their occurrence, which is unconventional to current methods. To solve this problem, with the aid of 3-measurement in temporal structure, we theoretically show that both latent variables and processes can be identified up to minor indeterminacy under mild assumptions. Moreover, we tackle the general nonlinear Causal Discovery (CD) from observations, e.g., temperature, as a specific task of learning independent representation, through the principle of functional equivalence. Based on these insights, we develop an estimation approach simultaneously recovering both the observed causal structure and latent causal process in a nontrivial manner. Simulation studies validate the theoretical foundations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In the experiments involving climate data, this approach offers a powerful and in-depth understanding of the climate system.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we compare traditional machine learning and deep learning models trained on a malware dataset when subjected to adversarial attack based on label-flipping. Specifically, we investigate the robustness of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), LightGBM, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), MobileNet, and DenseNet models when facing varying percentages of misleading labels. We empirically assess the the accuracy of each of these models under such an adversarial attack on the training data. This research aims to provide insights into which models are inherently more robust, in the sense of being better able to resist intentional disruptions to the training data. We find wide variation in the robustness of the models tested to adversarial attack, with our MLP model achieving the best combination of initial accuracy and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esha Datta, Johanna Hennig, Eva Domschot, Connor Mattes, Michael R. Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) become increasingly common, concerns about their robustness do as well. A longstanding problem for deployed DNNs is their behavior in the face of unfamiliar inputs; specifically, these models tend to be overconfident and incorrect when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. In this work, we present a topological approach to characterizing OOD examples using latent layer embeddings from DNNs. Our goal is to identify topological features, referred to as landmarks, that indicate OOD examples. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and a realistic DNN model, revealing a key insight for OOD detection. Well-trained DNNs have been shown to induce a topological simplification on training data for simple models and datasets; we show that this property holds for realistic, large-scale test and training data, but does not hold for OOD examples. More specifically, we find that the average lifetime (or persistence) of OOD examples is statistically longer than that of training or test examples. This indicates that DNNs struggle to induce topological simplification on unfamiliar inputs. Our empirical results provide novel evidence of topological simplification in realistic DNNs and lay the groundwork for topologically-informed OOD detection strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Ta, Patrick Foley, Mattson Thieme, Abhishek Pandey, Prashant Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating unique molecules with biochemically desired properties to serve as viable drug candidates is a difficult task that requires specialized domain expertise. In recent years, diffusion models have shown promising results in accelerating the drug design process through AI-driven molecular generation. However, training these models requires massive amounts of data, which are often isolated in proprietary silos. OpenFL is a federated learning framework that enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across these decentralized data sites. In this work, we present a federated discrete denoising diffusion model that was trained using OpenFL. The federated model achieves comparable performance with a model trained on centralized data when evaluating the uniqueness and validity of the generated molecules.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirali Purohit, Gedeon Muhawenayo, Esther Rolf, Hannah Kerner</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models have made rapid advances in many domains including Earth observation, where Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) can help address global challenges such as climate change, agriculture, and disaster response. Previous work on GFMs focused on tailoring model architecture and pre-text tasks, and did not investigate the impact of pre-training data selection on model performance. However, recent works from other domains show that the pre-training data distribution is an important factor influencing the performance of the foundation models. With this motivation, our research explores how the geographic distribution of pre-training data affects the performance of GFMs. We evaluated several pre-training data distributions by sampling different compositions from a global data pool. Our experiments with two GFMs on downstream tasks indicate that balanced and globally representative data compositions often outperform region-specific sampling, highlighting the importance of diversity and global coverage in pre-training data. Our results suggest that the most appropriate data sampling technique may depend on the specific GFM architecture. These findings will support the development of robust GFMs by incorporating quality pre-training data distributions, ultimately improving machine learning solutions for Earth observation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vanya Cohen, Geraud Nangue Tasse, Nakul Gopalan, Steven James, Matthew Gombolay, Ray Mooney, Benjamin Rosman</p>
<p>Abstract: Combining reinforcement learning with language grounding is challenging as the agent needs to explore the environment while simultaneously learning multiple language-conditioned tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel method: the compositionally-enabled reinforcement learning language agent (CERLLA). Our method reduces the sample complexity of tasks specified with language by leveraging compositional policy representations and a semantic parser trained using reinforcement learning and in-context learning. We evaluate our approach in an environment requiring function approximation and demonstrate compositional generalization to novel tasks. Our method significantly outperforms the previous best non-compositional baseline in terms of sample complexity on 162 tasks designed to test compositional generalization. Our model attains a higher success rate and learns in fewer steps than the non-compositional baseline. It reaches a success rate equal to an oracle policy's upper-bound performance of 92%. With the same number of environment steps, the baseline only reaches a success rate of 80%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyuan Chen, Hanshen Yu, Jamal Yagoobi, Chenhui Shao</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing approaches to enforcing design constraints in Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications often rely on training-time penalties in the reward function or training/inference-time invalid action masking, but these methods either cannot be modified after training, or are limited in the types of constraints that can be implemented. To address this limitation, we propose Reinforcement Learning Constrained Beam Search (RLCBS) for inference-time refinement in combinatorial optimization problems. This method respects flexible, inference-time constraints that support exclusion of invalid actions and forced inclusion of desired actions, and employs beam search to maximize sequence probability for more sensible constraint incorporation. RLCBS is extensible to RL-based planning and optimization problems that do not require real-time solution, and we apply the method to optimize process parameters for a novel modular testbed for paper drying. An RL agent is trained to minimize energy consumption across varying machine speed levels by generating optimal dryer module and air supply temperature configurations. Our results demonstrate that RLCBS outperforms NSGA-II under complex design constraints on drying module configurations at inference-time, while providing a 2.58-fold or higher speed improvement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Wang, Gonzalo R. Arce, Guangmo Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraph neural networks have been promising tools for handling learning tasks involving higher-order data, with notable applications in web graphs, such as modeling multi-way hyperlink structures and complex user interactions. Yet, their generalization abilities in theory are less clear to us. In this paper, we seek to develop margin-based generalization bounds for four representative classes of hypergraph neural networks, including convolutional-based methods (UniGCN), set-based aggregation (AllDeepSets), invariant and equivariant transformations (M-IGN), and tensor-based approaches (T-MPHN). Through the PAC-Bayes framework, our results reveal the manner in which hypergraph structure and spectral norms of the learned weights can affect the generalization bounds, where the key technical challenge lies in developing new perturbation analysis for hypergraph neural networks, which offers a rigorous understanding of how variations in the model's weights and hypergraph structure impact its generalization behavior. Our empirical study examines the relationship between the practical performance and theoretical bounds of the models over synthetic and real-world datasets. One of our primary observations is the strong correlation between the theoretical bounds and empirical loss, with statistically significant consistency in most cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emir Ceyani, Han Xie, Baturalp Buyukates, Carl Yang, Salman Avestimehr</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs are crucial for modeling relational and biological data. As datasets grow larger in real-world scenarios, the risk of exposing sensitive information increases, making privacy-preserving training methods like federated learning (FL) essential to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. Recently proposed personalized subgraph FL methods have become the de-facto standard for training personalized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a federated manner while dealing with the missing links across clients' subgraphs due to privacy restrictions. However, personalized subgraph FL faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity in client subgraphs, such as degree distributions among the nodes, which complicate federated training of graph models. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{FedGrAINS}, a novel data-adaptive and sampling-based regularization method for subgraph FL. FedGrAINS leverages generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to evaluate node importance concerning clients' tasks, dynamically adjusting the message-passing step in clients' GNNs. This adaptation reflects task-optimized sampling aligned with a trajectory balance objective. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of \textit{FedGrAINS} as a regularizer consistently improves the FL performance compared to baselines that do not leverage such regularization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongduo Sui, Jie Sun, Shuyao Wang, Zemin Liu, Qing Cui, Longfei Li, Xiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Invariant learning demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing the generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. It aims to recognize stable features in graph data for classification, based on the premise that these features causally determine the target label, and their influence is invariant to changes in distribution. Along this line, most studies have attempted to pinpoint these stable features by emphasizing explicit substructures in the graph, such as masked or attentive subgraphs, and primarily enforcing the invariance principle in the semantic space, i.e., graph representations. However, we argue that focusing only on the semantic space may not accurately identify these stable features. To address this, we introduce the Unified Invariant Learning (UIL) framework for graph classification. It provides a unified perspective on invariant graph learning, emphasizing both structural and semantic invariance principles to identify more robust stable features. In the graph space, UIL adheres to the structural invariance principle by reducing the distance between graphons over a set of stable features across different environments. Simultaneously, to confirm semantic invariance, UIL underscores that the acquired graph representations should demonstrate exemplary performance across diverse environments. We present both theoretical and empirical evidence to confirm our method's ability to recognize superior stable features. Moreover, through a series of comprehensive experiments complemented by in-depth analyses, we demonstrate that UIL considerably enhances OOD generalization, surpassing the performance of leading baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Tang, Yin-Fang Yang, Zhaofei Wang, Weijia Zhang, Min-Ling Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL) is an emerging learning framework where each training sample is represented as a multi-instance bag associated with a candidate label set. Existing MIPL algorithms often overlook the margins for attention scores and predicted probabilities, leading to suboptimal generalization performance. A critical issue with these algorithms is that the highest prediction probability of the classifier may appear on a non-candidate label. In this paper, we propose an algorithm named MIPLMA, i.e., Multi-Instance Partial-Label learning with Margin Adjustment, which adjusts the margins for attention scores and predicted probabilities. We introduce a margin-aware attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the margins for attention scores and propose a margin distribution loss to constrain the margins between the predicted probabilities on candidate and non-candidate label sets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MIPLMA over existing MIPL algorithms, as well as other well-established multi-instance learning algorithms and partial-label learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Liu, Mingjie Cai, Qingguo Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Feature selection can select important features to address dimensional curses. Subspace learning, a widely used dimensionality reduction method, can project the original data into a low-dimensional space. However, the low-dimensional representation is often transformed back into the original space, resulting in information loss. Additionally, gate function-based methods in Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) are commonly less discrimination. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method that integrates subspace learning with TSK-FS. Specifically, a projection matrix is used to fit the intrinsic low-dimensional representation. Subsequently, the low-dimensional representation is fed to TSK-FS to measure its availability. The firing strength is slacked so that TSK-FS is not limited by numerical underflow. Finally, the $\ell _{2,1}$-norm is introduced to select significant features and the connection to related works is discussed. The proposed method is evaluated against six state-of-the-art methods on eighteen datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huilin lai, Guang Zeng, Xunkai Li, Xudong Shen, Yinlin Zhu, Ye Luo, Jianwei Lu, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative machine learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models while preserving the privacy of raw graph data. However, existing FGL methods often overlook the model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL) problem, which arises in real-world applications, such as the aggregation of models from different companies with varying scales and architectures. MHtFGL presents an additional challenge: the diversity of client model architectures hampers common learning and integration of graph representations. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework, comprising two key components: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which fosters effective knowledge sharing among clients through copilot models; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which enhances model integration by accounting for the knowledge acquired by clients. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.74% over baseline models in MHtFGL scenarios, while also maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intrinsic reward shaping has emerged as a prevalent approach to solving hard-exploration and sparse-rewards environments in reinforcement learning (RL). While single intrinsic rewards, such as curiosity-driven or novelty-based methods, have shown effectiveness, they often limit the diversity and efficiency of exploration. Moreover, the potential and principle of combining multiple intrinsic rewards remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce HIRE (Hybrid Intrinsic REward), a flexible and elegant framework for creating hybrid intrinsic rewards through deliberate fusion strategies. With HIRE, we conduct a systematic analysis of the application of hybrid intrinsic rewards in both general and unsupervised RL across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIRE can significantly enhance exploration efficiency and diversity, as well as skill acquisition in complex and dynamic settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12633">Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Switching Rewards and History Dependency for Characterizing Animal Behaviors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyang Ke, Feiyang Wu, Jiyi Wang, Jeffrey Markowitz, Anqi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to studying decision-making in neuroscience focus on simplified behavioral tasks where animals perform repetitive, stereotyped actions to receive explicit rewards. While informative, these methods constrain our understanding of decision-making to short timescale behaviors driven by explicit goals. In natural environments, animals exhibit more complex, long-term behaviors driven by intrinsic motivations that are often unobservable. Recent works in time-varying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aim to capture shifting motivations in long-term, freely moving behaviors. However, a crucial challenge remains: animals make decisions based on their history, not just their current state. To address this, we introduce SWIRL (SWitching IRL), a novel framework that extends traditional IRL by incorporating time-varying, history-dependent reward functions. SWIRL models long behavioral sequences as transitions between short-term decision-making processes, each governed by a unique reward function. SWIRL incorporates biologically plausible history dependency to capture how past decisions and environmental contexts shape behavior, offering a more accurate description of animal decision-making. We apply SWIRL to simulated and real-world animal behavior datasets and show that it outperforms models lacking history dependency, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This work presents the first IRL model to incorporate history-dependent policies and rewards to advance our understanding of complex, naturalistic decision-making in animals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Luo, Tuan Truong, Tung Pham, Mehrtash Harandi, Dinh Phung, Trung Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has attracted significant attention for its effectiveness in improving generalization across various tasks. However, its underlying principles remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze SAM's training dynamics using the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness, and propose a third-order stochastic differential equation (SDE), which reveals that the dynamics are driven by a complex mixture of second- and third-order terms. We show that alignment between the perturbation vector and the top eigenvector is crucial for SAM's effectiveness in regularizing sharpness, but find that this alignment is often inadequate in practice, limiting SAM's efficiency. Building on these insights, we introduce Eigen-SAM, an algorithm that explicitly aims to regularize the top Hessian eigenvalue by aligning the perturbation vector with the leading eigenvector. We validate the effectiveness of our theory and the practical advantages of our proposed approach through comprehensive experiments. Code is available at https://github.com/RitianLuo/EigenSAM.</p>

<p>Abstract: Intelligent agents are able to make decisions based on different levels of granularity and duration. Recent advances in skill learning enabled the agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks by effectively guiding the agent in choosing appropriate skills. However, the practice of using fixed-length skills can easily result in skipping valuable decision points, which ultimately limits the potential for further exploration and faster policy learning. In this work, we propose to learn a simple and efficient termination condition that identifies decision points through a state-action novelty module that leverages agent experience data. Our approach, Novelty-based Decision Point Identification (NBDI), outperforms previous baselines in complex, long-horizon tasks, and remains effective even in the presence of significant variations in the environment configurations of downstream tasks, highlighting the importance of decision point identification in skill learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Moudgil, Boris Knyazev, Guillaume Lajoie, Eugene Belilovsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Learned optimization has emerged as a promising alternative to hand-crafted optimizers, with the potential to discover stronger learned update rules that enable faster, hyperparameter-free training of neural networks. A critical element for practically useful learned optimizers, that can be used off-the-shelf after meta-training, is strong meta-generalization: the ability to apply the optimizers to new tasks. Recent state-of-the-art work in learned optimizers, VeLO (Metz et al., 2022), requires a large number of highly diverse meta-training tasks along with massive computational resources, 4000 TPU months, to achieve meta-generalization. This makes further improvements to such learned optimizers impractical. In this work, we identify several key elements in learned optimizer architectures and meta-training procedures that can lead to strong meta-generalization. We also propose evaluation metrics to reliably assess quantitative performance of an optimizer at scale on a set of evaluation tasks. Our proposed approach, Celo, makes a significant leap in improving the meta-generalization performance of learned optimizers and also outperforms tuned state-of-the-art optimizers on a diverse set of out-of-distribution tasks, despite being meta-trained for just 24 GPU hours.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a framework for efficiently approximating differential-geometric primitives on arbitrary manifolds via construction of an atlas graph representation, which leverages the canonical characterization of a manifold as a finite collection, or atlas, of overlapping coordinate charts. We first show the utility of this framework in a setting where the manifold is expressed in closed form, specifically, a runtime advantage, compared with state-of-the-art approaches, for first-order optimization over the Grassmann manifold. Moreover, using point cloud data for which a complex manifold structure was previously established, i.e., high-contrast image patches, we show that an atlas graph with the correct geometry can be directly learned from the point cloud. Finally, we demonstrate that learning an atlas graph enables downstream key machine learning tasks. In particular, we implement a Riemannian generalization of support vector machines that uses the learned atlas graph to approximate complex differential-geometric primitives, including Riemannian logarithms and vector transports. These settings suggest the potential of this framework for even more complex settings, where ambient dimension and noise levels may be much higher.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet serving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands and high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 60% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge sharing among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to large quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce EchoLM, an in-context caching system that leverages historical requests as examples to guide response generation, enabling selective offloading of requests to more efficient LLMs. However, enabling this real-time knowledge transfer leads to intricate tradeoffs between response quality, latency, and system throughput at scale. For a new request, EchoLM identifies similar, high-utility examples and efficiently prepends them to the input for better response. At scale, EchoLM adaptively routes requests to LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. EchoLM employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism to improve example quality and coverage offline, maximizing cache utility and runtime efficiency. Evaluations on millions of open-source requests demonstrate that EchoLM has a throughput improvement of 1.4-5.9x while reducing latency by 28-71% without hurting response quality on average.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explainability techniques hold significant potential for enhancing the causal discovery process, which is crucial for understanding complex systems in areas like healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence. However, no causal discovery methods currently incorporate explainability into their models to derive causal graphs. Thus, in this paper we explore this innovative approach, as it offers substantial potential and represents a promising new direction worth investigating. Specifically, we introduce REX, a causal discovery method that leverages machine learning (ML) models coupled with explainability techniques, specifically Shapley values, to identify and interpret significant causal relationships among variables.
  Comparative evaluations on synthetic datasets comprising continuous tabular data reveal that REX outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods across diverse data generation processes, including non-linear and additive noise models. Moreover, REX was tested on the Sachs single-cell protein-signaling dataset, achieving a precision of 0.952 and recovering key causal relationships with no incorrect edges. Taking together, these results showcase REX's effectiveness in accurately recovering true causal structures while minimizing false positive predictions, its robustness across diverse datasets, and its applicability to real-world problems. By combining ML and explainability techniques with causal discovery, REX bridges the gap between predictive modeling and causal inference, offering an effective tool for understanding complex causal structures.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sota Mashiko, Yuji Kawamata, Tomoru Nakayama, Tetsuya Sakurai, Yukihiko Okada</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in financial auditing and effective detection often requires obtaining large volumes of data from multiple organizations. However, confidentiality concerns hinder data sharing among audit firms. Although the federated learning (FL)-based approach, FedAvg, has been proposed to address this challenge, its use of mutiple communication rounds increases its overhead, limiting its practicality. In this study, we propose a novel framework employing Data Collaboration (DC) analysis -- a non-model share-type FL method -- to streamline model training into a single communication round. Our method first encodes journal entry data via dimensionality reduction to obtain secure intermediate representations, then transforms them into collaboration representations for building an autoencoder that detects anomalies. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic dataset and real journal entry data from multiple organizations. The results show that our method not only outperforms single-organization baselines but also exceeds FedAvg in non-i.i.d. experiments on real journal entry data that closely mirror real-world conditions. By preserving data confidentiality and reducing iterative communication, this study addresses a key auditing challenge -- ensuring data confidentiality while integrating knowledge from multiple audit firms. Our findings represent a significant advance in artificial intelligence-driven auditing and underscore the potential of FL methods in high-security domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moshe Eliasof, Alessio Gravina, Andrea Ceni, Claudio Gallicchio, Davide Bacciu, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph State Space Models (SSMs) have recently been introduced to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in modeling long-range interactions. Despite their success, existing methods either compromise on permutation equivariance or limit their focus to pairwise interactions rather than sequences. Building on the connection between Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and SSM, in this paper, we introduce GRAMA, a Graph Adaptive method based on a learnable Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) framework that addresses these limitations. By transforming from static to sequential graph data, GRAMA leverages the strengths of the ARMA framework, while preserving permutation equivariance. Moreover, GRAMA incorporates a selective attention mechanism for dynamic learning of ARMA coefficients, enabling efficient and flexible long-range information propagation. We also establish theoretical connections between GRAMA and Selective SSMs, providing insights into its ability to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on 14 synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GRAMA consistently outperforms backbone models and performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenjia Bai, Yang Zhang, Shuang Qiu, Qiaosheng Zhang, Kang Xu, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown great potential in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human preferences. Existing methods perform preference alignment from a fixed dataset, which can be limited in data coverage, and the resulting reward model is hard to generalize in out-of-distribution responses. Thus, online RLHF is more desirable to empower the LLM to explore outside the support of the initial dataset by iteratively collecting the prompt-response pairs. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem in online RLHF, i.e. \emph{how to explore} for LLM. We give a theoretical motivation in linear reward assumption to show that an optimistic reward with an upper confidence bound (UCB) term leads to a provably efficient RLHF policy. Then, we reformulate our objective to direct preference optimization with an exploration term, where the UCB-term can be converted to a count-based exploration bonus. We further propose a practical algorithm, named \emph{Count-based Online Preference Optimization (COPO)}, which leverages a simple coin-flip counting module to estimate the pseudo-count of a prompt-response pair in previously collected data. COPO encourages LLMs to balance exploration and preference optimization in an iterative manner, which enlarges the exploration space and the entire data coverage of iterative LLM policies. We conduct online RLHF experiments on Zephyr and Llama-3 models. The results on instruction-following and standard academic benchmarks show that COPO significantly increases performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Fan, Zhanyi Hu, Fuyi Wang, Cen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Data heterogeneity and backdoor attacks rank among the most significant challenges facing federated learning (FL). For data heterogeneity, personalized federated learning (PFL) enables each client to maintain a private personalized model to cater to client-specific knowledge. Meanwhile, vanilla FL has proven vulnerable to backdoor attacks. However, recent advancements in PFL community have demonstrated a potential immunity against such attacks. This paper explores this intersection further, revealing that existing federated backdoor attacks fail in PFL because backdoors about manually designed triggers struggle to survive in personalized models. To tackle this, we design Bad-PFL, which employs features from natural data as our trigger. As long as the model is trained on natural data, it inevitably embeds the backdoor associated with our trigger, ensuring its longevity in personalized models. Moreover, our trigger undergoes mutual reinforcement training with the model, further solidifying the backdoor's durability and enhancing attack effectiveness. The large-scale experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our attack against various PFL methods, even when equipped with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Yang, Wei Xie, Xiaohua Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) play an important role as an emerging technology in the rapidly growing field of quantum machine learning. While their empirical success is evident, the theoretical explorations of QNNs, particularly their generalization properties, are less developed and primarily focus on the uniform convergence approach. In this paper, we exploit an advanced tool in statistical learning theory, i.e., algorithmic stability, to study the generalization of QNNs. We first establish high-probability generalization bounds for QNNs via uniform stability. Our bounds shed light on the key factors influencing the generalization performance of QNNs and provide practical insights into both the design and training processes. We next explore the generalization of QNNs on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, highlighting the potential benefits of quantum noise. Moreover, we argue that previous analysis characterizes worst-case generalization guarantees, and we establish a refined optimization-dependent generalization bound for QNNs via on-average stability. Numerical experiments on various real-world datasets support our theoretical findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niloufar Zakariaei, Shadab Ahamed, Eldad Haber, Moshe Eliasof</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the backbone of many deep learning methods, but optimizing them remains computationally expensive. To address this, we explore multiscale training frameworks and mathematically identify key challenges, particularly when dealing with noisy inputs. Our analysis reveals that in the presence of noise, the gradient of standard CNNs in multiscale training may fail to converge as the mesh-size approaches to , undermining the optimization process. This insight drives the development of Mesh-Free Convolutions (MFCs), which are independent of input scale and avoid the pitfalls of traditional convolution kernels. We demonstrate that MFCs, with their robust gradient behavior, ensure convergence even with noisy inputs, enabling more efficient neural network optimization in multiscale settings. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our multiscale training approach, we show that (i) MFCs can theoretically deliver substantial computational speedups without sacrificing performance in practice, and (ii) standard convolutions benefit from our multiscale training framework in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Coby Penso, Jacob Goldberger, Ethan Fetaya</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a method to control prediction uncertainty by producing a small prediction set, ensuring a predetermined probability that the true class lies within this set. This is commonly done by defining a score, based on the model predictions, and setting a threshold on this score using a validation set. In this study, we address the problem of CP calibration when we only have access to a validation set with noisy labels. We show how we can estimate the noise-free conformal threshold based on the noisy labeled data. Our solution is flexible and can accommodate various modeling assumptions regarding the label contamination process, without needing any information about the underlying data distribution or the internal mechanisms of the machine learning classifier. We develop a coverage guarantee for uniform noise that is effective even in tasks with a large number of classes. We dub our approach Noise-Aware Conformal Prediction (NACP) and show on several natural and medical image classification datasets, including ImageNet, that it significantly outperforms current noisy label methods and achieves results comparable to those obtained with a clean validation set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Giacomarra, Mehran Hosseini, Nicola Paoletti, Francesca Cairoli</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks and diffusion models, have recently emerged as powerful tools for planning tasks and behavior synthesis in autonomous systems. Various guidance strategies have been introduced to steer the generative process toward outputs that are more likely to satisfy the planning objectives. These strategies avoid the need for model retraining but do not provide any guarantee that the generated outputs will satisfy the desired planning objectives. To address this limitation, we introduce certified guidance, an approach that modifies a generative model, without retraining it, into a new model guaranteed to satisfy a given specification with probability one. We focus on Signal Temporal Logic specifications, which are rich enough to describe nontrivial planning tasks. Our approach leverages neural network verification techniques to systematically explore the latent spaces of the generative models, identifying latent regions that are certifiably correct with respect to the STL property of interest. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on four planning benchmarks using GANs and diffusion models. Our results confirm that certified guidance produces generative models that are always correct, unlike existing guidance methods that are not certified.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hilmy Baja, Michiel Kallenberg, Ioannis N. Athanasiadis</p>
<p>Abstract: Farmers rely on in-field observations to make well-informed crop management decisions to maximize profit and minimize adverse environmental impact. However, obtaining real-world crop state measurements is labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. In most cases, it is not feasible to gather crop state measurements before every decision moment. Moreover, in previous research pertaining to farm management optimization, these observations are often assumed to be readily available without any cost, which is unrealistic. Hence, enabling optimization without the need to have temporally complete crop state observations is important. An approach to that problem is to include measuring as part of decision making. As a solution, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to recommend opportune moments to simultaneously measure crop features and apply nitrogen fertilizer. With realistic considerations, we design an RL environment with explicit crop feature measuring costs. While balancing costs, we find that an RL agent, trained with recurrent PPO, discovers adaptive measuring policies that follow critical crop development stages, with results aligned by what domain experts would consider a sensible approach. Our results highlight the importance of measuring when crop feature measurements are not readily available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Liu, Fuhui Zhou, Xiaodong Liu, Rui Ding, Lu Yuan, Qihui Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectrum maps reflect the utilization and distribution of spectrum resources in the electromagnetic environment, serving as an effective approach to support spectrum management. However, the construction of spectrum maps in urban environments is challenging because of high-density connection and complex terrain. Moreover, the existing spectrum map construction methods are typically applied to a fixed frequency, which cannot cover the entire frequency band. To address the aforementioned challenges, a UNet-based data-and-semantic dual-driven method is proposed by introducing the semantic knowledge of binary city maps and binary sampling location maps to enhance the accuracy of spectrum map construction in complex urban environments with dense communications. Moreover, a joint frequency-space reasoning model is exploited to capture the correlation of spectrum data in terms of space and frequency, enabling the realization of complete spectrum map construction without sampling all frequencies of spectrum data. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can infer the spectrum utilization status of missing frequencies and improve the completeness of the spectrum map construction. Furthermore, the accuracy of spectrum map construction achieved by the proposed data-and-semantic dual-driven method outperforms the benchmark schemes, especially in scenarios with low sampling density.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12857">HierPromptLM: A Pure PLM-based Framework for Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Text-rich Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuyu Zhu, Liang Zhang, Qianxiong Xu, Cheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation learning on heterogeneous text-rich networks (HTRNs), which consist of multiple types of nodes and edges with each node associated with textual information, is essential for various real-world applications. Given the success of pretrained language models (PLMs) in processing text data, recent efforts have focused on integrating PLMs into HTRN representation learning. These methods typically handle textual and structural information separately, using both PLMs and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). However, this separation fails to capture the critical interactions between these two types of information within HTRNs. Additionally, it necessitates an extra alignment step, which is challenging due to the fundamental differences between distinct embedding spaces generated by PLMs and HGNNs. To deal with it, we propose HierPromptLM, a novel pure PLM-based framework that seamlessly models both text data and graph structures without the need for separate processing. Firstly, we develop a Hierarchical Prompt module that employs prompt learning to integrate text data and heterogeneous graph structures at both the node and edge levels, within a unified textual space. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce two innovative HTRN-tailored pretraining tasks to fine-tune PLMs for representation learning by emphasizing the inherent heterogeneity and interactions between textual and structural information within HTRNs. Extensive experiments on two real-world HTRN datasets demonstrate HierPromptLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements of up to 6.08% for node classification and 10.84% for link prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pruning the parameters and structure of neural networks reduces the computational complexity, energy consumption, and latency during inference. Recently, a novel underlying mechanism for successful deep learning (DL) was presented based on a method that quantitatively measures the single filter performance in each layer of a DL architecture, and a new comprehensive mechanism of how deep learning works was presented. Herein, we demonstrate how this understanding paves the path to highly dilute the convolutional layers of deep architectures without affecting their overall accuracy using applied filter cluster connections (AFCC). AFCC is exemplified on VGG-11 and EfficientNet-B0 architectures trained on CIFAR-100, and its high pruning outperforms other techniques using the same pruning magnitude. Additionally, this technique is broadened to single nodal performance and highly pruning of fully connected layers, suggesting a possible implementation to considerably reduce the complexity of over-parameterized AI tasks.</p>

Previous research has focused on different walk strategies, optimization objectives, and embedding learning models. Inspired by observations on real data, we take a different approach and propose a new regularization technique. More precisely, the frequencies of node pairs generated by the skip-gram model on random walk node sequences follow a highly skewed distribution which causes learning to be dominated by a fraction of the pairs. We address the issue by designing an efficient sampling procedure that generates node pairs according to their {\em smoothed frequency}. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our approach.</p>

The core idea is based on our mathematical findings, which show that a pair of parameters can be represented by a single rotation angle using the complex rotation scheme. Building on this insight, we map the parameters into a complex space and perform quantization using the corresponding rotation angles. To efficiently integrate it into optimization process, we develop an efficient system of geometric equations that computes the precise rotation angles with linear complexity. We evaluate $\pi$-Quant on a wide range of tasks. Our experiments show that it can reduce the bit-width of parameters to 3.32-bit, achieving a 75% reduction in parameter scale and a 40% decrease in GPU memory usage, all while maintaining full accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ella Koresh, Ronit D. Gross, Yuval Meir, Yarden Tzach, Tal Halevi, Ido Kanter</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) evaluate short-range correlations in input images which progress along the layers, whereas vision transformer (ViT) architectures evaluate long-range correlations, using repeated transformer encoders composed of fully connected layers. Both are designed to solve complex classification tasks but from different perspectives. This study demonstrates that CNNs and ViT architectures stem from a unified underlying learning mechanism, which quantitatively measures the single-nodal performance (SNP) of each node in feedforward (FF) and multi-head attention (MHA) subblocks. Each node identifies small clusters of possible output labels, with additional noise represented as labels outside these clusters. These features are progressively sharpened along the transformer encoders, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. This unified underlying learning mechanism leads to two main findings. First, it enables an efficient applied nodal diagonal connection (ANDC) pruning technique without affecting the accuracy. Second, based on the SNP, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs among the MHA heads, such that each head focuses its attention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. Consequently, each head becomes an expert in recognizing its designated labels, representing a quantitative MHA modus vivendi mechanism. These results are based on a compact convolutional transformer architecture trained on the CIFAR-100 and Flowers-102 datasets and call for their extension to other architectures and applications, such as natural language processing.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahin Vazifehdan, Pietro Bosoni, Daniele Pala, Eleonora Tavazzi, Roberto Bergamaschi, Riccardo Bellazzi, Arianna Dagliati</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease characterized by progressive or alternate impairment of neurological functions (motor, sensory, visual, and cognitive). Predicting disease progression with a probabilistic and time-dependent approach might help in suggesting interventions that can delay the progression of the disease. However, extracting informative knowledge from irregularly collected longitudinal data is difficult, and missing data pose significant challenges. MS progression is measured through the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which quantifies and monitors disability in MS over time. EDSS assesses impairment in eight functional systems (FS). Frequently, only the EDSS score assigned by clinicians is reported, while FS sub-scores are missing. Imputing these scores might be useful, especially to stratify patients according to their phenotype assessed over the disease progression. This study aimed at i) exploring different methodologies for imputing missing FS sub-scores, and ii) predicting the EDSS score using complete clinical data. Results show that Exponential Weighted Moving Average achieved the lowest error rate in the missing data imputation task; furthermore, the combination of Classification and Regression Trees for the imputation and SVM for the prediction task obtained the best accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengxiang Zhao, Xiaoming Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their substantial resource requirements. While low-bit quantized weights can reduce memory usage and improve inference efficiency, current hardware lacks native support for mixed-precision General Matrix Multiplication (mpGEMM), resulting in inefficient dequantization-based implementations. Moreover, uniform quantization methods often fail to capture weight distributions adequately, leading to performance degradation. We propose GANQ (GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization), a layer-wise post-training non-uniform quantization framework optimized for hardware-efficient lookup table-based mpGEMM. GANQ achieves superior quantization performance by utilizing a training-free, GPU-adaptive optimization algorithm to efficiently reduce layer-wise quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate GANQ's ability to reduce the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline compared to state-of-the-art methods for both 3-bit and 4-bit quantization. Furthermore, when deployed on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, GANQ's quantized models achieve up to 2.57$\times$ speedup over the baseline, advancing memory and inference efficiency in LLM deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kristof Meding</p>
<p>Abstract: What constitutes a fair decision? This question is not only difficult for humans but becomes more challenging when Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are used. In light of discriminatory algorithmic behaviors, the EU has recently passed the AI Act, which mandates specific rules for AI models, incorporating both traditional legal non-discrimination regulations and machine learning based algorithmic fairness concepts. This paper aims to bridge these two different concepts in the AI Act through: First a high-level introduction of both concepts targeting legal and computer science-oriented scholars, and second an in-depth analysis of the AI Act's relationship between legal non-discrimination regulations and algorithmic fairness. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1.), most non-discrimination regulations target only high-risk AI systems. (2.), the regulation of high-risk systems encompasses both data input requirements and output monitoring, though these regulations are often inconsistent and raise questions of computational feasibility. (3.) Regulations for General Purpose AI Models, such as Large Language Models that are not simultaneously classified as high-risk systems, currently lack specificity compared to other regulations. Based on these findings, we recommend developing more specific auditing and testing methodologies for AI systems. This paper aims to serve as a foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration between legal scholars and computer science-oriented machine learning researchers studying discrimination in AI systems.</p>

We present a novel characterization of rank, grounded in the well-known Transformer architecture. We show that the rank of a function $f$ corresponds to the minimum number of Chain of Thought (CoT) steps required by a single-layer transformer decoder with hard attention to compute $f$. Based on this characterization we establish tight bounds on the number of CoT steps required for specific problems, showing that $\ell$-fold function composition necessitates exactly $\ell$ CoT steps. Furthermore, we analyze the problem of identifying the position of the $k$-th occurrence of 1 in a Boolean sequence, proving that it requires $k$ CoT steps.</p>

<p>Abstract: Future advanced AI systems may learn sophisticated strategies through reinforcement learning (RL) that humans cannot understand well enough to safely evaluate. We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired multi-step plans that receive high reward (multi-step "reward hacks") even if humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method, Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Boone, Odalric-Ambrym Maillard</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper is devoted to the extension of the regret lower bound beyond ergodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) in the problem dependent setting. While the regret lower bound for ergodic MDPs is well-known and reached by tractable algorithms, we prove that the regret lower bound becomes significatively more complex in communicating MDPs. Our lower bound revisits the necessary explorative behavior of consistent learning agents and further explains that all optimal regions of the environment must be overvisited compared to sub-optimal ones, a phenomenon that we refer to as co-exploration. In tandem, we show that these two explorative and co-explorative behaviors are intertwined with navigation constraints obtained by scrutinizing the navigation structure at logarithmic scale. The resulting lower bound is expressed as the solution of an optimization problem that, in many standard classes of MDPs, can be specialized to recover existing results. From a computational perspective, it is provably $\Sigma_2^\textrm{P}$-hard in general and as a matter of fact, even testing the membership to the feasible region is coNP-hard. We further provide an algorithm to approximate the lower bound in a constructive way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirmohammad Farzaneh, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
<p>Abstract: In sensitive application domains, multi-objective hyperparameter selection can ensure the reliability of AI models prior to deployment, while optimizing auxiliary performance metrics. The state-of-the-art Pareto Testing (PT) method guarantees statistical reliability constraints by adopting a multiple hypothesis testing framework. In PT, hyperparameters are validated one at a time, following a data-driven order determined by expected reliability levels. This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-objective hyperparameter selection that captures the interdependencies among the reliability levels of different hyperparameter configurations using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is termed the reliability graph (RG). The RG is constructed based on prior information and data by using the Bradley-Terry model. The proposed approach, RG-based PT (RG-PT), leverages the RG to enable the efficient, parallel testing of multiple hyperparameters at the same reliability level. By integrating False Discovery Rate (FDR) control, RG-PT ensures robust statistical reliability guarantees and is shown via experiments across diverse domains to consistently yield superior solutions for multi-objective calibration problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Long Kiu Chung, Shreyas Kousik</p>
<p>Abstract: Even though neural networks are being increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, it remains difficult to enforce constraints on their output, meaning that it is hard to guarantee safety in such settings. Towards addressing this, many existing methods seek to verify a neural network's satisfaction of safety constraints, but do not address how to correct an "unsafe" network. On the other hand, the few works that extract a training signal from verification cannot handle non-convex sets, and are either conservative or slow. To address these challenges, this work proposes a neural network training method that can encourage the exact reachable set of a non-convex input set through a neural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities to avoid a non-convex unsafe region, using recent results in non-convex set representation with hybrid zonotopes and extracting gradient information from mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). The proposed method is fast, with the computational complexity of each training iteration comparable to that of solving a linear program (LP) with number of dimensions and constraints linear to the number of neurons and complexity of input and unsafe sets. For a neural network with three hidden layers of width 30, the method was able to drive the reachable set of a non-convex input set with 55 generators and 26 constraints out of a non-convex unsafe region with 21 generators and 11 constraints in 490 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bernardo \'Avila Pires, Mark Rowland, Diana Borsa, Zhaohan Daniel Guo, Khimya Khetarpal, Andr\'e Barreto, David Abel, R\'emi Munos, Will Dabney</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond expected utilities, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained so far (since the first time step). We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we combine the core ideas of distributional value iteration with the deep RL agent DQN, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) aims to find meaningful representations from unlabeled data by encoding semantic similarities through data augmentations. Despite its current popularity, theoretical insights about SSL are still scarce. For example, it is not yet known whether commonly used SSL loss functions can be related to a statistical model, much in the same as OLS, generalized linear models or PCA naturally emerge as maximum likelihood estimates of an underlying generative process. In this short paper, we consider a latent variable statistical model for SSL that exhibits an interesting property: Depending on the informativeness of the data augmentations, the MLE of the model either reduces to PCA, or approaches a simple non-contrastive loss. We analyze the model and also empirically illustrate our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Hu, Guibin Zhang, Peiyuan Liu, Disen Lan, Naiqi Li, Dawei Cheng, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia, Shirui Pan</p>
<p>Abstract: Current time series forecasting methods can be broadly classified into two categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies, both aiming to capture the complex dependencies within time series data. However, the CI strategy fails to exploit highly correlated covariate information, while the CD strategy integrates all dependencies, including irrelevant or noisy ones, thus compromising generalization. To mitigate these issues, recent works have introduced the Channel Clustering (CC) strategy by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying different modeling techniques to each cluster. However, coarse-grained clustering cannot flexibly capture complex, time-varying interactions. Addressing the above challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a graph-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. Specifically, after constructing the graph with the input sequence, TimeFilter filters out irrelevant correlations and preserves the most critical ones through patch-specific filtering. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stephanie Holly, Thomas Bierweiler, Stefan von Dosky, Ahmed Frikha, Clemens Heitzinger, Jana Eder</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of IoT (Internet of Things) sensor-based machine learning models in industrial systems for anomaly classification tasks poses significant challenges due to distribution shifts, as the training data acquired in controlled laboratory settings may significantly differ from real-time data in production environments. Furthermore, many real-world applications cannot provide a substantial number of labeled examples for each anomalous class in every new environment. It is therefore crucial to develop adaptable machine learning models that can be effectively transferred from one environment to another, enabling rapid adaptation using normal operational data. We extended this problem setting to an arbitrary classification task and formulated the one-class domain adaptation (OC-DA) problem setting. We took a meta-learning approach to tackle the challenge of OC-DA, and proposed a task sampling strategy to adapt any bi-level meta-learning algorithm to OC-DA. We modified the well-established model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm and introduced the OC-DA MAML algorithm. We provided a theoretical analysis showing that OC-DA MAML optimizes for meta-parameters that enable rapid one-class adaptation across domains. The OC-DA MAML algorithm is evaluated on the Rainbow-MNIST meta-learning benchmark and on a real-world dataset of vibration-based sensor readings. The results show that OC-DA MAML significantly improves the performance on the target domains and outperforms MAML using the standard task sampling strategy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwei Shi, Mengyue Yang, Qi Zhang, Weinan Zhang, Cunjia Liu, Weiru Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, such as gas leak detection or environmental pollutant tracking, solving the Inverse Source Localization and Characterization problem involves navigating complex, dynamic fields with sparse and noisy observations. Traditional methods face significant challenges, including partial observability, temporal and spatial dynamics, out-of-distribution generalization, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning. The framework leverages an attention-enhanced particle filtering mechanism for efficient and accurate belief updates, and incorporates two complementary execution strategies: Attention Particle Filtering Planning and Attention Particle Filtering Reinforcement Learning. These approaches optimize exploration and adaptation under uncertainty. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of the attention-enhanced particle filter, while extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the framework's superior accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the framework's potential for broad applications in dynamic field estimation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachael L. Fleurence, Dalia Dawoud, Jiang Bian, Mitchell K. Higashi, Xiaoyan Wang, Hua Xu, Jagpreet Chhatwal, Turgay Ayer</p>
<p>Abstract: Introduction. Generative Artificial Intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offers transformative potential for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR). However, evaluating the quality, transparency, and rigor of LLM-assisted research lacks standardized guidance. This article introduces the ELEVATE AI LLMs framework and checklist, designed to support researchers and reviewers in assessing LLM use in HEOR.
  Methods. The ELEVATE AI LLMs framework was developed through a targeted review of existing guidelines and evaluation frameworks. The framework comprises ten evaluation domains, including model characteristics, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and fairness. The accompanying checklist operationalizes the framework. To validate the framework, we applied it to two published studies, demonstrating its usability across different HEOR tasks.
  Results. The ELEVATE AI LLMs framework provides a comprehensive structure for evaluating LLM-assisted research, while the checklist facilitates practical application. Validation of the framework and checklist on studies of systematic literature reviews and health economic modeling highlighted their ability to identify strengths and gaps in reporting.
  Limitations. While the ELEVATE AI LLMs framework provides robust guidance, its broader generalizability and applicability to diverse HEOR tasks require further empirical testing. Additionally, several metrics adapted from computer science need further validation in HEOR contexts.
  Conclusion. The ELEVATE AI LLMs framework and checklist fill a critical gap in HEOR by offering structured guidance for evaluating LLM-assisted research. By promoting transparency, accuracy, and reproducibility, they aim to standardize and improve the integration of LLMs into HEOR, ensuring their outputs meet the field's rigorous standards.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial step in the development of robust supervised learning models, especially when dealing with limited datasets. This study explores interpolation techniques for the augmentation of geo-referenced data, with the aim of predicting the presence of Commelina benghalensis L. in sugarcane plots in La R\'eunion. Given the spatial nature of the data and the high cost of data collection, we evaluated two interpolation approaches: Gaussian processes (GPs) with different kernels and kriging with various variograms. The objectives of this work are threefold: (i) to identify which interpolation methods offer the best predictive performance for various regression algorithms, (ii) to analyze the evolution of performance as a function of the number of observations added, and (iii) to assess the spatial consistency of augmented datasets. The results show that GP-based methods, in particular with combined kernels (GP-COMB), significantly improve the performance of regression algorithms while requiring less additional data. Although kriging shows slightly lower performance, it is distinguished by a more homogeneous spatial coverage, a potential advantage in certain contexts.</p>

<p>Abstract: While ML model training and inference are both GPU-intensive, CPU-based data processing is often the bottleneck. Distributed data processing systems based on the batch or stream processing models assume homogeneous resource requirements. They excel at CPU-based computation but either under-utilize heterogeneous resources or impose high overheads on failure and reconfiguration. We introduce the streaming batch model, a hybrid of the two models that enables efficient and fault-tolerant heterogeneous execution. The key idea is to execute one partition at a time to allow lineage-based recovery with dynamic resource allocation. This enables memory-efficient pipelining across heterogeneous resources, similar to stream processing, but also offers the elasticity and fault tolerance properties of batch processing. We present Ray Data, an implementation of the streaming batch model that improves throughput on heterogeneous batch inference pipelines by 3--8$\times$ compared to traditional batch and stream processing systems. When training Stable Diffusion, Ray Data matches the throughput of single-node ML data loaders while additionally leveraging distributed heterogeneous clusters to further improve training throughput by 31%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Simulating realistic driving behavior is crucial for developing and testing autonomous systems in complex traffic environments. Equally important is the ability to control the behavior of simulated agents to tailor scenarios to specific research needs and safety considerations. This paper extends the general-purpose multi-agent driving behavior model ITRA (Scibior et al., 2021), by introducing a method called Control-ITRA to influence agent behavior through waypoint assignment and target speed modulation. By conditioning agents on these two aspects, we provide a mechanism for them to adhere to specific trajectories and indirectly adjust their aggressiveness. We compare different approaches for integrating these conditions during training and demonstrate that our method can generate controllable, infraction-free trajectories while preserving realism in both seen and unseen locations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feda Bolus Al Baqain, Omar Sultan Al-Kadi</p>
<p>Abstract: Histopathological image analysis is a reliable method for prostate cancer identification. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of two approaches for segmenting glandular structures in prostate images to automate Gleason grading. The first approach utilizes a hand-crafted learning technique, combining Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture descriptors to highlight spatial dependencies and minimize information loss at the pixel level. For machine driven feature extraction, we employ a U-Net convolutional neural network to perform semantic segmentation of prostate gland stroma tissue. Support vector machine-based learning of hand-crafted features achieves impressive classification accuracies of 99.0% and 95.1% for GLCM and LBP, respectively, while the U-Net-based machine-driven features attain 94% accuracy. Furthermore, a comparative analysis demonstrates superior segmentation quality for histopathological grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the U-Net approach, as assessed by Jaccard and Dice metrics. This work underscores the utility of machine-driven features in clinical applications that rely on automated pixel-level segmentation in prostate tissue images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siming Liang, Hoang Tran, Feng Bao, Hristo G. Chipilski, Peter Jan van Leeuwen, Guannan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Data assimilation plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting turbulent systems within geoscience and weather forecasting, where data assimilation is used to address three fundamental challenges, i.e., high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and partial observations. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based data assimilation methods have demonstrated encouraging results. In this work, we develop an ensemble score filter (EnSF) that integrates image inpainting to solve the data assimilation problems with partial observations. The EnSF method exploits an exclusively designed training-free diffusion models to solve high-dimensional nonlinear data assimilation problems. Its performance has been successfully demonstrated in the context of having full observations, i.e., all the state variables are directly or indirectly observed. However, because the EnSF does not use a covariance matrix to capture the dependence between the observed and unobserved state variables, it is nontrivial to extend the original EnSF method to the partial observation scenario. In this work, we incorporate various image inpainting techniques into the EnSF to predict the unobserved states during data assimilation. At each filtering step, we first use the diffusion model to estimate the observed states by integrating the likelihood information into the score function. Then, we use image inpainting methods to predict the unobserved state variables. We demonstrate the performance of the EnSF with inpainting by tracking the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model dynamics under a variety of scenarios. The successful proof of concept paves the way to more in-depth investigations on exploiting modern image inpainting techniques to advance data assimilation methodology for practical geoscience and weather forecasting problems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The evolving requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) applications are driving an increasing shift toward bringing intelligence to the edge, enabling real-time insights and decision-making within resource-constrained environments. Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has emerged as a key enabler of this evolution, facilitating the deployment of ML models on devices such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. However, the complexity of managing the TinyML lifecycle, including stages such as data processing, model optimization and conversion, and device deployment, presents significant challenges and often requires substantial human intervention. Motivated by these challenges, we began exploring whether Large Language Models (LLMs) could help automate and streamline the TinyML lifecycle. We developed a framework that leverages the natural language processing (NLP) and code generation capabilities of LLMs to reduce development time and lower the barriers to entry for TinyML deployment. Through a case study involving a computer vision classification model, we demonstrate the framework's ability to automate key stages of the TinyML lifecycle. Our findings suggest that LLM-powered automation holds potential for improving the lifecycle development process and adapting to diverse requirements. However, while this approach shows promise, there remain obstacles and limitations, particularly in achieving fully automated solutions. This paper sheds light on both the challenges and opportunities of integrating LLMs into TinyML workflows, providing insights into the path forward for efficient, AI-assisted embedded system development.</p>

<p>Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI applications but poses significant challenges in safeguarding user privacy. Ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA while addressing nuanced privacy risks requires robust and scalable frameworks. This paper presents a detailed study of OneShield Privacy Guard, a framework designed to mitigate privacy risks in user inputs and LLM outputs across enterprise and open-source settings. We analyze two real-world deployments:(1) a multilingual privacy-preserving system integrated with Data and Model Factory, focusing on enterprise-scale data governance; and (2) PR Insights, an open-source repository emphasizing automated triaging and community-driven refinements. In Deployment 1, OneShield achieved a 0.95 F1 score in detecting sensitive entities like dates, names, and phone numbers across 26 languages, outperforming state-of-the-art tool such as StarPII and Presidio by up to 12\%. Deployment 2, with an average F1 score of 0.86, reduced manual effort by over 300 hours in three months, accurately flagging 8.25\% of 1,256 pull requests for privacy risks with enhanced context sensitivity. These results demonstrate OneShield's adaptability and efficacy in diverse environments, offering actionable insights for context-aware entity recognition, automated compliance, and ethical AI adoption. This work advances privacy-preserving frameworks, supporting user trust and compliance across operational contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adarsh Kumar Kosta, Amogh Joshi, Arjun Roy, Rohan Kumar Manna, Manish Nagaraj, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection and tracking is an essential perception task for enabling fully autonomous navigation in robotic systems. Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The attribution of the author of an art piece is typically a laborious manual process, usually relying on subjective evaluations of expert figures. However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.</p>

However, the deployment of SemCom systems in industrial settings presents considerable challenges, such as high radio frequency interference (RFI), that can adversely affect system performance. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel approach based on integrating sequence spreading techniques with SemCom to enhance system robustness against such adverse conditions and enable scalable multi-user (MU) SemCom. In addition, we propose a novel signal refining network (SRN) to refine the received signal after despreading and equalization. The proposed network eliminates the need for computationally intensive end-to-end (E2E) training while improving performance metrics, achieving a 25% gain in BLEU score and a 12% increase in semantic similarity compared to E2E training using the same bandwidth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianchuan Liu, Tao Chen, Sheng Mao, Mohan Chenb</p>
<p>Abstract: Tungsten-copper (W-Cu) compounds are widely utilized in various industrial fields due to their exceptional mechanical properties. In this study, we have developed a neural-network-based deep potential (DP) model that covers a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 0 to 3,000 K, and pressures, varying from 0 to 10 GPa. This study presents a model trained using density functional theory data for full concentration CuxW100-x compounds. Through this model, we systematically investigate the structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu alloys and have the following findings. First, the bulk modulus (B) and Young's modulus (E) of W-Cu alloys exhibit a linear decline as the Cu content increases, indicating a softening trend in the CuxW100-x compounds as the Cu concentration rises. Second, a higher Cu content results in higher critical strain and lower critical stress for these compounds. A brittle-to-ductile transition in the deformation mode predicted is predicted at around 37.5 at. % Cu content. Third, tensile loading tests in the W-Cu gradient structure reveal that Cu-poor region serves as a barrier, hindering shear band propagation while promoting new shear band formation in the Cu-rich region. The above results from the DP model are anticipated to aid in exploring the physical mechanisms underlying the complex phenomena of W-Cu systems and contribute to the advancement of methodologies for materials simulation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Chen, Yaofang Suo, Rui Liu, Luonan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering dominant patterns and exploring dynamic behaviors especially critical state transitions and tipping points in high-dimensional time-series data are challenging tasks in study of real-world complex systems, which demand interpretable data representations to facilitate comprehension of both spatial and temporal information within the original data space. Here, we proposed a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lauren Lyons, Ali Ghanbari</p>
<p>Abstract: Mutation analysis of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a promising method for effective evaluation of test data quality and model robustness, but it can be computationally expensive, especially for large models. To alleviate this, we present DEEPMAACC, a technique and a tool that speeds up DNN mutation analysis through neuron and mutant clustering. DEEPMAACC implements two methods: (1) neuron clustering to reduce the number of generated mutants and (2) mutant clustering to reduce the number of mutants to be tested by selecting representative mutants for testing. Both use hierarchical agglomerative clustering to group neurons and mutants with similar weights, with the goal of improving efficiency while maintaining mutation score. DEEPMAACC has been evaluated on 8 DNN models across 4 popular classification datasets and two DNN architectures. When compared to exhaustive, or vanilla, mutation analysis, the results provide empirical evidence that neuron clustering approach, on average, accelerates mutation analysis by 69.77%, with an average -26.84% error in mutation score. Meanwhile, mutant clustering approach, on average, accelerates mutation analysis by 35.31%, with an average 1.96% error in mutation score. Our results demonstrate that a trade-off can be made between mutation testing speed and mutation score error.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Pang, Zhihao Zhan, Xiang Zhu, Yechao Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Most motion deblurring algorithms rely on spatial-domain convolution models, which struggle with the complex, non-linear blur arising from camera shake and object motion. In contrast, we propose a novel single-image deblurring approach that treats motion blur as a temporal averaging phenomenon. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a pre-trained video diffusion transformer model to capture diverse motion dynamics within a latent space. It sidesteps explicit kernel estimation and effectively accommodates diverse motion patterns. We implement the algorithm within a diffusion-based inverse problem framework. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in deblurring complex motion blur scenarios. This work paves the way for utilizing powerful video diffusion models to address single-image deblurring challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shakeeb Murtaza, Soufiane Belharbi, Marco Pedersoli, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) using classification models trained with only image-class labels remains an important challenge in computer vision. Given their reliance on classification objectives, traditional WSOL methods like class activation mapping focus on the most discriminative object parts, often missing the full spatial extent. In contrast, recent WSOL methods based on vision-language models like CLIP require ground truth classes or external classifiers to produce a localization map, limiting their deployment in downstream tasks. Moreover, methods like GenPromp attempt to address these issues but introduce considerable complexity due to their reliance on conditional denoising processes and intricate prompt learning. This paper introduces Text Distillation for Localization (TeD-Loc), an approach that directly distills knowledge from CLIP text embeddings into the model backbone and produces patch-level localization. Multiple instance learning of these image patches allows for accurate localization and classification using one model without requiring external classifiers. Such integration of textual and visual modalities addresses the longstanding challenge of achieving accurate localization and classification concurrently, as WSOL methods in the literature typically converge at different epochs. Extensive experiments show that leveraging text embeddings and localization cues provides a cost-effective WSOL model. TeD-Loc improves Top-1 LOC accuracy over state-of-the-art models by about 5% on both CUB and ILSVRC datasets, while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to GenPromp.</p>

<p>Abstract: The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence has placed immense demands on computing hardware, but traditional silicon-based semiconductor technologies are approaching their physical and economic limit, prompting the exploration of novel computing paradigms. Memristor offers a promising solution, enabling in-memory analog computation and massive parallelism, which leads to low latency and power consumption. This manuscript reviews the current status of memristor-based machine learning accelerators, highlighting the milestones achieved in developing prototype chips, that not only accelerate neural networks inference but also tackle other machine learning tasks. More importantly, it discusses our opinion on current key challenges that remain in this field, such as device variation, the need for efficient peripheral circuitry, and systematic co-design and optimization. We also share our perspective on potential future directions, some of which address existing challenges while others explore untouched territories. By addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary efforts spanning device engineering, circuit design, and systems architecture, memristor-based accelerators could significantly advance the capabilities of AI hardware, particularly for edge applications where power efficiency is paramount.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Wu, Maoxin Ji, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
<p>Abstract: On-ramp merging presents a critical challenge in autonomous driving, as vehicles from merging lanes need to dynamically adjust their positions and speeds while monitoring traffic on the main road to prevent collisions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel merging control scheme based on reinforcement learning, which integrates lateral control mechanisms. This approach ensures the smooth integration of vehicles from the merging lane onto the main road, optimizing both fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication on control strategies and introduce an enhanced protocol leveraging Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4. This protocol aims to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) and improve communication reliability. In our simulations, we employ two AoI-based metrics to rigorously assess the protocol's effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. By combining the NS3 network simulator with Python, we simulate V2V communication and vehicle control simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the enhanced C-V2X Mode 4 outperforms the standard version, while the proposed control scheme ensures safe and reliable vehicle operation during on-ramp merging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenbin Zhou, Liyan Xie, Zhigang Peng, Shixiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential change-point detection plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications, where timely identification of distributional shifts can greatly mitigate adverse outcomes. Classical methods commonly rely on parametric density assumptions of pre- and post-change distributions, limiting their effectiveness for high-dimensional, complex data streams. This paper proposes a score-based CUSUM change-point detection, in which the score functions of the data distribution are estimated by injecting noise and applying denoising score matching. We consider both offline and online versions of score estimation. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that denoising score matching can enhance detection power by effectively controlling the injected noise scale. Finally, we validate the practical efficacy of our method through numerical experiments on two synthetic datasets and a real-world earthquake precursor detection task, demonstrating its effectiveness in challenging scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hazem Taha, Ameer M. S. Abdelhadi</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces HEPPO, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to optimize the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) stage in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike previous approaches that focused on trajectory collection and actor-critic updates, HEPPO addresses GAE's computational demands with a parallel, pipelined architecture implemented on a single System-on-Chip (SoC). This design allows for the adaptation of various hardware accelerators tailored for different PPO phases. A key innovation is our strategic standardization technique, which combines dynamic reward standardization and block standardization for values, followed by 8-bit uniform quantization. This method stabilizes learning, enhances performance, and manages memory bottlenecks, achieving a 4x reduction in memory usage and a 1.5x increase in cumulative rewards. We propose a solution on a single SoC device with programmable logic and embedded processors, delivering throughput orders of magnitude higher than traditional CPU-GPU systems. Our single-chip solution minimizes communication latency and throughput bottlenecks, significantly boosting PPO training efficiency. Experimental results show a 30% increase in PPO speed and a substantial reduction in memory access time, underscoring HEPPO's potential for broad applicability in hardware-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a differentiable ray-tracing based model that incorporates aberrations and distortions to render realistic coded hyperspectral acquisitions using Coded-Aperture Spectral Snapshot Imagers (CASSI). CASSI systems can now be optimized in order to fulfill simultaneously several optical design constraints as well as processing constraints. Four comparable CASSI systems with varying degree of optical aberrations have been designed and modeled. The resulting rendered hyperspectral acquisitions from each of these systems are combined with five state-of-the-art hyperspectral cube reconstruction processes. These reconstruction processes encompass a mapping function created from each system's propagation model to account for distortions and aberrations during the reconstruction process. Our analyses show that if properly modeled, the effects of geometric distortions of the system and misalignments of the dispersive elements have a marginal impact on the overall quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral data cubes. Therefore, relaxing traditional constraints on measurement conformity and fidelity to the scene enables the development of novel imaging instruments, guided by performance metrics applied to the design or the processing of acquisitions. By providing a complete framework for design, simulation and evaluation, this work contributes to the optimization and exploration of new CASSI systems, and more generally to the computational imaging community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Patent figure classification facilitates faceted search in patent retrieval systems, enabling efficient prior art search. Existing approaches have explored patent figure classification for only a single aspect and for aspects with a limited number of concepts. In recent years, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown tremendous performance across numerous computer vision downstream tasks, however, they remain unexplored for patent figure classification. Our work explores the efficacy of LVLMs in patent figure visual question answering (VQA) and classification, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. For this purpose, we introduce new datasets, PatFigVQA and PatFigCLS, for fine-tuning and evaluation regarding multiple aspects of patent figures~(i.e., type, projection, patent class, and objects). For a computational-effective handling of a large number of classes using LVLM, we propose a novel tournament-style classification strategy that leverages a series of multiple-choice questions. Experimental results and comparisons of multiple classification approaches based on LVLMs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in few-shot settings show the feasibility of the proposed approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Bian, Min Liu, Yunqi Yi, Xueping Wang, Yunfeng Ma, Yaonan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning based person re-identification (re-id) models have been widely employed in surveillance systems. Recent studies have demonstrated that black-box single-modality and cross-modality re-id models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), leaving the robustness of multi-modality re-id models unexplored. Due to the lack of knowledge about the specific type of model deployed in the target black-box surveillance system, we aim to generate modality unified AEs for omni-modality (single-, cross- and multi-modality) re-id models. Specifically, we propose a novel Modality Unified Attack method to train modality-specific adversarial generators to generate AEs that effectively attack different omni-modality models. A multi-modality model is adopted as the surrogate model, wherein the features of each modality are perturbed by metric disruption loss before fusion. To collapse the common features of omni-modality models, Cross Modality Simulated Disruption approach is introduced to mimic the cross-modality feature embeddings by intentionally feeding images to non-corresponding modality-specific subnetworks of the surrogate model. Moreover, Multi Modality Collaborative Disruption strategy is devised to facilitate the attacker to comprehensively corrupt the informative content of person images by leveraging a multi modality feature collaborative metric disruption loss. Extensive experiments show that our MUA method can effectively attack the omni-modality re-id models, achieving 55.9%, 24.4%, 49.0% and 62.7% mean mAP Drop Rate, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of learning-augmented algorithms has gained significant attention in recent years. These algorithms, using potentially inaccurate predictions, must exhibit three key properties: consistency, robustness, and smoothness. In scenarios where distributional information about predictions is available, a strong expected performance is required. Typically, the design of these algorithms involves a natural tradeoff between consistency and robustness, and previous works aimed to achieve Pareto-optimal tradeoffs for specific problems. However, in some settings, this comes at the expense of smoothness. This paper demonstrates that certain problems involve multiple tradeoffs between consistency, robustness, smoothness, and average performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a hidden hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ by making a single batch of queries (non-adaptively). We consider the hyperedge detection model, in which every query must be of the form:
  ``Does this set $S\subseteq V$ contain at least one full hyperedge?''
  In this model, it is known that there is no algorithm that allows to non-adaptively learn arbitrary hypergraphs by making fewer than $\Omega(\min\{m^2\log n, n^2\})$ even when the hypergraph is constrained to be $2$-uniform (i.e. the hypergraph is simply a graph). Recently, Li et al. overcame this lower bound in the setting in which $G$ is a graph by assuming that the graph learned is sampled from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model. We generalize the result of Li et al. to the setting of random $k$-uniform hypergraphs. To achieve this result, we leverage a novel equivalence between the problem of learning a single hyperedge and the standard group testing problem. This latter result may also be of independent interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as it enables real-time traffic flow management, reduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of urban transportation networks. With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.</p>

By leveraging a tree hierarchy for fine-grained labels, we investigate hybrid losses, such as generalised triplet and cross-entropy losses, to enforce similarity between labels within a multi-task learning framework. We propose metrics to evaluate the embedding space structure and assess the model's ability to generalise to unseen classes, that is, to infer similar classes for data belonging to unseen categories. Our experiments on OrchideaSOL, a four-level hierarchical instrument sound dataset with nearly 200 detailed categories, demonstrate that the proposed hybrid losses outperform previous works in classification, retrieval, embedding space structure, and generalisation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zitang Sun, Yen-Ju Chen, Yung-Hao Yang, Yuan Li, Shin'ya Nishida</p>
<p>Abstract: Our research aims to develop machines that learn to perceive visual motion as do humans. While recent advances in computer vision (CV) have enabled DNN-based models to accurately estimate optical flow in naturalistic images, a significant disparity remains between CV models and the biological visual system in both architecture and behavior. This disparity includes humans' ability to perceive the motion of higher-order image features (second-order motion), which many CV models fail to capture because of their reliance on the intensity conservation law. Our model architecture mimics the cortical V1-MT motion processing pathway, utilizing a trainable motion energy sensor bank and a recurrent graph network. Supervised learning employing diverse naturalistic videos allows the model to replicate psychophysical and physiological findings about first-order (luminance-based) motion perception. For second-order motion, inspired by neuroscientific findings, the model includes an additional sensing pathway with nonlinear preprocessing before motion energy sensing, implemented using a simple multilayer 3D CNN block. When exploring how the brain acquired the ability to perceive second-order motion in natural environments, in which pure second-order signals are rare, we hypothesized that second-order mechanisms were critical when estimating robust object motion amidst optical fluctuations, such as highlights on glossy surfaces. We trained our dual-pathway model on novel motion datasets with varying material properties of moving objects. We found that training to estimate object motion from non-Lambertian materials naturally endowed the model with the capacity to perceive second-order motion, as can humans. The resulting model effectively aligns with biological systems while generalizing to both first- and second-order motion phenomena in natural scenes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> John Pavlopoulos, Juli Bakagianni, Kanella Pouli, Maria Gavriilidou</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for lesser-resourced languages faces persistent challenges, including limited datasets, inherited biases from high-resource languages, and the need for domain-specific solutions. This study addresses these gaps for Modern Greek through three key contributions. First, we evaluate the performance of open-source (Llama-70b) and closed-source (GPT-4o mini) large language models (LLMs) on seven core NLP tasks with dataset availability, revealing task-specific strengths, weaknesses, and parity in their performance. Second, we expand the scope of Greek NLP by reframing Authorship Attribution as a tool to assess potential data usage by LLMs in pre-training, with high 0-shot accuracy suggesting ethical implications for data provenance. Third, we showcase a legal NLP case study, where a Summarize, Translate, and Embed (STE) methodology outperforms the traditional TF-IDF approach for clustering \emph{long} legal texts. Together, these contributions provide a roadmap to advance NLP in lesser-resourced languages, bridging gaps in model evaluation, task innovation, and real-world impact.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves correctness of Question Answering (QA) and addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet greatly increase computational costs. Besides, RAG is not always needed as may introduce irrelevant information. Recent adaptive retrieval methods integrate LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with external information appealing to LLM self-knowledge, but they often neglect efficiency evaluations and comparisons with uncertainty estimation techniques. We bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 35 adaptive retrieval methods, including 8 recent approaches and 27 uncertainty estimation techniques, across 6 datasets using 10 metrics for QA performance, self-knowledge, and efficiency. Our findings show that uncertainty estimation techniques often outperform complex pipelines in terms of efficiency and self-knowledge, while maintaining comparable QA performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Foster, Abhishek Gulati, Mark Harman, Inna Harper, Ke Mao, Jillian Ritchey, Herv\'e Robert, Shubho Sengupta</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes Meta's ACH system for mutation-guided LLM-based test generation. ACH generates relatively few mutants (aka simulated faults), compared to traditional mutation testing. Instead, it focuses on generating currently undetected faults that are specific to an issue of concern. From these currently uncaught faults, ACH generates tests that can catch them, thereby `killing' the mutants and consequently hardening the platform against regressions. We use privacy concerns to illustrate our approach, but ACH can harden code against {\em any} type of regression. In total, ACH was applied to 10,795 Android Kotlin classes in 7 software platforms deployed by Meta, from which it generated 9,095 mutants and 571 privacy-hardening test cases. ACH also deploys an LLM-based equivalent mutant detection agent that achieves a precision of 0.79 and a recall of 0.47 (rising to 0.95 and 0.96 with simple pre-processing). ACH was used by Messenger and WhatsApp test-a-thons where engineers accepted 73% of its tests, judging 36% to privacy relevant. We conclude that ACH hardens code against specific concerns and that, even when its tests do not directly tackle the specific concern, engineers find them useful for their other benefits.</p>

<p>Abstract: Images as an artistic medium often rely on specific camera angles and lens distortions to convey ideas or emotions; however, such precise control is missing in current text-to-image models. We propose an efficient and general solution that allows precise control over the camera when generating both photographic and artistic images. Unlike prior methods that rely on predefined shots, we rely solely on four simple extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters, removing the need for pre-existing geometry, reference 3D objects, and multi-view data. We also present a novel dataset with more than 57,000 images, along with their text prompts and ground-truth camera parameters. Our evaluation shows precise camera control in text-to-image generation, surpassing traditional prompt engineering approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdulkadir Korkmaz, Praveen Rao</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning method that supports training models on decentralized devices or servers, where each holds its local data, removing the need for data exchange. This approach is especially useful in healthcare, as it enables training on sensitive data without needing to share them. The nature of federated learning necessitates robust security precautions due to data leakage concerns during communication. To address this issue, we propose a new approach that employs selective encryption, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and bit-wise scrambling to minimize data leakage while achieving good execution performance. Our technique , FAS (fast and secure federated learning) is used to train deep learning models on medical imaging data. We implemented our technique using the Flower framework and compared with a state-of-the-art federated learning approach that also uses selective homomorphic encryption. Our experiments were run in a cluster of eleven physical machines to create a real-world federated learning scenario on different datasets. We observed that our approach is up to 90\% faster than applying fully homomorphic encryption on the model weights. In addition, we can avoid the pretraining step that is required by our competitor and can save up to 20\% in terms of total execution time. While our approach was faster, it obtained similar security results as the competitor.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12934">Correctness Assessment of Code Generated by Large Language Models Using Internal Representations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan-Dung Bui, Thanh Trong Vu, Thu-Trang Nguyen, Son Nguyen, Hieu Dinh Vo</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the correctness of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a significant challenge in AI-driven software development. Existing approaches predominantly rely on black-box (closed-box) approaches that evaluate correctness post-generation, failing to utilize the rich insights embedded in the LLMs' internal states during code generation. In this paper, we introduce OPENIA, a novel white-box (open-box) framework that leverages these internal representations to assess the correctness of LLM-generated code. OPENIA systematically analyzes the intermediate states of representative open-source LLMs specialized for code, including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama, and MagicCoder, across diverse code generation benchmarks. Our empirical analysis reveals that these internal representations encode latent information, which strongly correlates with the correctness of the generated code. Building on these insights, OPENIA uses a white-box/open-box approach to make informed predictions about code correctness, offering significant advantages in adaptability and robustness over traditional classification-based methods and zero-shot approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that OPENIA consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Scores with up to a 2X improvement in standalone code generation and a 46% enhancement in repository-specific scenarios. By unlocking the potential of in-process signals, OPENIA paves the way for more proactive and efficient quality assurance mechanisms in LLM-assisted code generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Lazzaro, Ciara Pike-Burke</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the piecewise constant bandit problem where the expected reward is a piecewise constant function with one change point (discontinuity) across the action space $[0,1]$ and the learner's aim is to locate the change point. Under the assumption of a fixed exploration budget, we provide the first non-asymptotic analysis of policies designed to locate abrupt changes in the mean reward function under bandit feedback. We study the problem under a large and small budget regime, and for both settings establish lower bounds on the error probability and provide algorithms with near matching upper bounds. Interestingly, our results show a separation in the complexity of the two regimes. We then propose a regime adaptive algorithm which is near optimal for both small and large budgets simultaneously. We complement our theoretical analysis with experimental results in simulated environments to support our findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiadong Liang, Zhihan Huang, Yuxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates how diffusion generative models leverage (unknown) low-dimensional structure to accelerate sampling. Focusing on two mainstream samplers -- the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) -- and assuming accurate score estimates, we prove that their iteration complexities are no greater than the order of $k/\varepsilon$ (up to some log factor), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is some intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. Our results are applicable to a broad family of target distributions without requiring smoothness or log-concavity assumptions. Further, we develop a lower bound that suggests the (near) necessity of the coefficients introduced by Ho et al.(2020) and Song et al.(2020) in facilitating low-dimensional adaptation. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence for the adaptivity of the DDIM-type samplers to unknown low-dimensional structure, and improve over the state-of-the-art DDPM theory regarding total variation convergence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) addresses key limitations of online MARL, such as safety concerns, expensive data collection, extended training intervals, and high signaling overhead caused by online interactions with the environment. In this work, we propose an offline MARL algorithm for radio resource management (RRM), focusing on optimizing scheduling policies for multiple access points (APs) to jointly maximize the sum and tail rates of user equipment (UEs). We evaluate three training paradigms: centralized, independent, and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline MARL framework outperforms conventional baseline approaches, achieving over a 15\% improvement in a weighted combination of sum and tail rates. Additionally, the CTDE framework strikes an effective balance, reducing the computational complexity of centralized methods while addressing the inefficiencies of independent training. These results underscore the potential of offline MARL to deliver scalable, robust, and efficient solutions for resource management in dynamic wireless networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Louis Aberdeen, Mark Hansen, Melvyn L. Smith, Lyndon Smith</p>
<p>Abstract: As the density of spacecraft in Earth's orbit increases, their recognition, pose and trajectory identification becomes crucial for averting potential collisions and executing debris removal operations. However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ang Lv, Ruobing Xie, Yining Qian, Songhao Wu, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Di Wang, Rui Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models mostly use a router to assign tokens to specific expert modules, activating only partial parameters and often outperforming dense models. We argue that the separation between the router's decision-making and the experts' execution is a critical yet overlooked issue, leading to suboptimal expert selection and ineffective learning. To address this, we propose Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE), a novel MoE paradigm in which experts autonomously select themselves to process inputs. AoE is based on the insight that an expert is aware of its own capacity to effectively process a token, an awareness reflected in the scale of its internal activations. In AoE, routers are removed; instead, experts pre-compute internal activations for inputs and are ranked based on their activation norms. Only the top-ranking experts proceed with the forward pass, while the others abort. The overhead of pre-computing activations is reduced through a low-rank weight factorization. This self-evaluating-then-partner-comparing approach ensures improved expert selection and effective learning. We pre-train language models having 700M up to 4B parameters, demonstrating that AoE outperforms traditional MoE models with comparable efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities that render them valuable in different applications, including conversational AI products. It is paramount to ensure the security and reliability of these products by mitigating their vulnerabilities towards malicious user interactions, which can lead to the exposure of great risks and reputational repercussions. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the efficacy of fine-tuning and aligning Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses of different LLMs that serve as input moderation guardrails. We systematically explore various tuning methods by leveraging a small set of training data to adapt these models as proxy defense mechanisms to detect malicious inputs and provide a reasoning for their verdicts, thereby preventing the exploitation of conversational agents. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy and robustness of different tuning strategies to generalize across diverse adversarial and malicious query types. Our experimental results outline the potential of alignment processes tailored to a varied range of harmful input queries, even with constrained data resources. These techniques significantly enhance the safety of conversational AI systems and provide a feasible framework for deploying more secure and trustworthy AI-driven interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshay Krishnan, Xinchen Yan, Vincent Casser, Abhijit Kundu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art for image generation. Trained on large datasets, they capture expressive image priors that have been used for tasks like inpainting, depth, and (surface) normal prediction. However, these models are typically trained for one specific task, e.g., a separate model for each of color, depth, and normal prediction. Such models do not leverage the intrinsic correlation between appearance and geometry, often leading to inconsistent predictions.
  In this paper, we propose using a novel image diffusion prior that jointly encodes appearance and geometry. We introduce a diffusion model Orchid, comprising a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode color, depth, and surface normals to a latent space, and a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for generating these joint latents. Orchid directly generates photo-realistic color images, relative depth, and surface normals from user-provided text, and can be used to create image-aligned partial 3D scenes seamlessly. It can also perform image-conditioned tasks like joint monocular depth and normal prediction and is competitive in accuracy to state-of-the-art methods designed for those tasks alone. Lastly, our model learns a joint prior that can be used zero-shot as a regularizer for many inverse problems that entangle appearance and geometry. For example, we demonstrate its effectiveness in color-depth-normal inpainting, showcasing its applicability to problems in 3D generation from sparse views.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kayvon Mazooji, Ilan Shomorony</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity in what the "correct" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters $K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is variation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple relatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an information-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous, and design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is unambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high density regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like two distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the clustering. The algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or "seeds") using a density-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$ partial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement and test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle overlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection and displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used algorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Lei, Julius Berner, Jiongxiao Wang, Zhongzhu Chen, Zhongjia Ba, Kui Ren, Jun Zhu, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness is essential for deep neural networks, especially in security-sensitive applications. To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average.

Finally, we empirically confirm our theoretical results by comparing the summarizer rate-distortion function with the performances of different summarizers used in practice.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling. They consist of a forward process that perturbs input data with Gaussian white noise and a reverse process that learns a score function to generate samples by denoising. Despite their tremendous success, they are mostly formulated on finite-dimensional spaces, e.g., Euclidean, limiting their applications to many domains where the data has a functional form, such as in scientific computing and 3D geometric data analysis. This work introduces a mathematically rigorous framework called Denoising Diffusion Operators (DDOs) for training diffusion models in function space. In DDOs, the forward process perturbs input functions gradually using a Gaussian process. The generative process is formulated by a function-valued annealed Langevin dynamic. Our approach requires an appropriate notion of the score for the perturbed data distribution, which we obtain by generalizing denoising score matching to function spaces that can be infinite-dimensional. We show that the corresponding discretized algorithm generates accurate samples at a fixed cost independent of the data resolution. We theoretically and numerically verify the applicability of our approach on a set of function-valued problems, including generating solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation viewed as the push-forward distribution of forcings from a Gaussian Random Field (GRF), as well as volcano InSAR and MNIST-SDF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Pedramfar, Vaneet Aggarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of combinatorial multiarmed bandits with stochastic submodular (in expectation) rewards and full-bandit delayed feedback, where the delayed feedback is assumed to be composite and anonymous. In other words, the delayed feedback is composed of components of rewards from past actions, with unknown division among the sub-components. Three models of delayed feedback: bounded adversarial, stochastic independent, and stochastic conditionally independent are studied, and regret bounds are derived for each of the delay models. Ignoring the problem dependent parameters, we show that regret bound for all the delay models is $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3} + T^{1/3} \nu)$ for time horizon $T$, where $\nu$ is a delay parameter defined differently in the three cases, thus demonstrating an additive term in regret with delay in all the three delay models. The considered algorithm is demonstrated to outperform other full-bandit approaches with delayed composite anonymous feedback.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ressi Bonti Muhammad, Sergey Alyaev, Reidar Brumer Bratvold</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory adjustment decisions throughout the drilling process, called geosteering, affect subsequent choices and information gathering, thus resulting in a coupled sequential decision problem. Previous works on applying decision optimization methods in geosteering rely on greedy optimization or approximate dynamic programming (ADP). Either decision optimization method requires explicit uncertainty and objective function models, making developing decision optimization methods for complex and realistic geosteering environments challenging to impossible. We use the Deep Q-Network (DQN) method, a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method that learns directly from the decision environment, to optimize geosteering decisions. The expensive computations for RL are handled during the offline training stage. Evaluating DQN needed for real-time decision support takes milliseconds and is faster than the traditional alternatives. Moreover, for two previously published synthetic geosteering scenarios, our results show that RL achieves high-quality outcomes comparable to the quasi-optimal ADP. Yet, the model-free nature of RL means that by replacing the training environment, we can extend it to problems where the solution to ADP is prohibitively expensive to compute. This flexibility will allow applying it to more complex environments and make hybrid versions trained with real data in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the global challenge of understanding and characterizing biodiversity, short species-specific genomic sequences known as DNA barcodes play a critical role, enabling fine-grained comparisons among organisms within the same kingdom of life. Although machine learning algorithms specifically designed for the analysis of DNA barcodes are becoming more popular, most existing methodologies rely on generic supervised training algorithms. We introduce BarcodeBERT, a family of models tailored to biodiversity analysis and trained exclusively on data from a reference library of 1.5M invertebrate DNA barcodes. We compared the performance of BarcodeBERT on taxonomic identification tasks against a spectrum of machine learning approaches including supervised training of classical neural architectures and fine-tuning of general DNA foundation models. Our self-supervised pretraining strategies on domain-specific data outperform fine-tuned foundation models, especially in identification tasks involving lower taxa such as genera and species. We also compared BarcodeBERT with BLAST, one of the most widely used bioinformatics tools for sequence searching, and found that our method matched BLAST's performance in species-level classification while being 55 times faster. Our analysis of masking and tokenization strategies also provides practical guidance for building customized DNA language models, emphasizing the importance of aligning model training strategies with dataset characteristics and domain knowledge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juefei Chen, Longxiu Huang, Yimin Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an important unsupervised learning method to extract meaningful features from data. To address the NMF problem within a polynomial time framework, researchers have introduced a separability assumption, which has recently evolved into the concept of coseparability. This advancement offers a more efficient core representation for the original data. However, in the real world, the data is more natural to be represented as a multi-dimensional array, such as images or videos. The NMF's application to high-dimensional data involves vectorization, which risks losing essential multi-dimensional correlations. To retain these inherent correlations in the data, we turn to tensors (multidimensional arrays) and leverage the tensor t-product. This approach extends the coseparable NMF to the tensor setting, creating what we term coseparable Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF). In this work, we provide an alternating index selection method to select the coseparable core. Furthermore, we validate the t-CUR sampling theory and integrate it with the tensor Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (t-DEIM) to introduce an alternative, randomized index selection process. These methods have been tested on both synthetic and facial analysis datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency of coseparable NTF when compared to coseparable NMF.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma, Fred Maurice Ngol\`e Mboula, Antoine Souloumiac</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning systems operate under the assumption that training and test data are sampled from a fixed probability distribution. However, this assumptions is rarely verified in practice, as the conditions upon which data was acquired are likely to change. In this context, the adaptation of the unsupervised domain requires minimal access to the data of the new conditions for learning models robust to changes in the data distribution. Optimal transport is a theoretically grounded tool for analyzing changes in distribution, especially as it allows the mapping between domains. However, these methods are usually computationally expensive as their complexity scales cubically with the number of samples. In this work, we explore optimal transport between Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which is conveniently written in terms of the components of source and target GMMs. We experiment with 9 benchmarks, with a total of $85$ adaptation tasks, showing that our methods are more efficient than previous shallow domain adaptation methods, and they scale well with number of samples $n$ and dimensions $d$.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05427">Decision Mamba: A Multi-Grained State Space Model with Self-Evolution Regularization for Offline RL</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Lv, Xiang Deng, Gongwei Chen, Michael Yu Wang, Liqiang Nie</p>
<p>Abstract: While the conditional sequence modeling with the transformer architecture has demonstrated its effectiveness in dealing with offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, it is struggle to handle out-of-distribution states and actions. Existing work attempts to address this issue by data augmentation with the learned policy or adding extra constraints with the value-based RL algorithm. However, these studies still fail to overcome the following challenges: (1) insufficiently utilizing the historical temporal information among inter-steps, (2) overlooking the local intrastep relationships among return-to-gos (RTGs), states, and actions, (3) overfitting suboptimal trajectories with noisy labels. To address these challenges, we propose Decision Mamba (DM), a novel multi-grained state space model (SSM) with a self-evolving policy learning strategy. DM explicitly models the historical hidden state to extract the temporal information by using the mamba architecture. To capture the relationship among RTG-state-action triplets, a fine-grained SSM module is designed and integrated into the original coarse-grained SSM in mamba, resulting in a novel mamba architecture tailored for offline RL. Finally, to mitigate the overfitting issue on noisy trajectories, a self-evolving policy is proposed by using progressive regularization. The policy evolves by using its own past knowledge to refine the suboptimal actions, thus enhancing its robustness on noisy demonstrations. Extensive experiments on various tasks show that DM outperforms other baselines substantially.</p>

<p>Abstract: Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tuan L. Vo, Thu Nguyen, Luis M. Lopez-Ramos, Hugo L. Hammer, Michael A. Riegler, Pal Halvorsen</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing data is a prevalent issue that can significantly impair model performance and explainability. This paper briefly summarizes the development of the field of missing data with respect to Explainable Artificial Intelligence and experimentally investigates the effects of various imputation methods on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a popular technique for explaining the output of complex machine learning models. Next, we compare different imputation strategies and assess their impact on feature importance and interaction as determined by Shapley values. Moreover, we also theoretically analyze the effects of missing values on Shapley values. Importantly, our findings reveal that the choice of imputation method can introduce biases that could lead to changes in the Shapley values, thereby affecting the explainability of the model. Moreover, we also show that a lower test prediction MSE (Mean Square Error) does not necessarily imply a lower MSE in Shapley values and vice versa. Also, while XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a method that could handle missing data directly, using XGBoost directly on missing data can seriously affect explainability compared to imputing the data before training XGBoost. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of imputation methods in the context of model explanations, offering practical guidance for selecting appropriate techniques based on dataset characteristics and analysis objectives. The results underscore the importance of considering imputation effects to ensure robust and reliable insights from machine learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Lin, Mingyu Lu, Chanwoo Kim, Su-In Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: As diffusion models are deployed in real-world settings, and their performance is driven by training data, appraising the contribution of data contributors is crucial to creating incentives for sharing quality data and to implementing policies for data compensation. Depending on the use case, model performance corresponds to various global properties of the distribution learned by a diffusion model (e.g., overall aesthetic quality). Hence, here we address the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to data contributors. The Shapley value provides a principled approach to valuation by uniquely satisfying game-theoretic axioms of fairness. However, estimating Shapley values for diffusion models is computationally impractical because it requires retraining on many training data subsets corresponding to different contributors and rerunning inference. We introduce a method to efficiently retrain and rerun inference for Shapley value estimation, by leveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We evaluate the utility of our method with three use cases: (i) image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset, (ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) aesthetic quality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist artworks. Our results empirically demonstrate that our framework can identify important data contributors across models' global properties, outperforming existing attribution methods for diffusion models.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01575">Deep Learning Framework for History Matching CO2 Storage with 4D Seismic and Monitoring Well Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nanzhe Wang, Louis J. Durlofsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Geological carbon storage entails the injection of megatonnes of supercritical CO2 into subsurface formations. The properties of these formations are usually highly uncertain, which makes design and optimization of large-scale storage operations challenging. In this paper we introduce a history matching strategy that enables the calibration of formation properties based on early-time observations. Early-time assessments are essential to assure the operation is performing as planned. Our framework involves two fit-for-purpose deep learning surrogate models that provide predictions for in-situ monitoring well data and interpreted time-lapse (4D) seismic saturation data. These two types of data are at very different scales of resolution, so it is appropriate to construct separate, specialized deep learning networks for their prediction. This approach results in a workflow that is more straightforward to design and more efficient to train than a single surrogate that provides global high-fidelity predictions. The deep learning models are integrated into a hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) history matching procedure. History matching is performed on a synthetic case with and without 4D seismic data, which allows us to quantify the impact of 4D seismic on uncertainty reduction. The use of both data types is shown to provide substantial uncertainty reduction in key geomodel parameters and to enable accurate predictions of CO2 plume dynamics. The overall history matching framework developed in this study represents an efficient way to integrate multiple data types and to assess the impact of each on uncertainty reduction and performance predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In high-stake domains such as healthcare and hiring, the role of machine learning (ML) in decision-making raises significant fairness concerns. This work focuses on Counterfactual Fairness (CF), which posits that an ML model's outcome on any individual should remain unchanged if they had belonged to a different demographic group. Previous works have proposed methods that guarantee CF. Notwithstanding, their effects on the model's predictive performance remains largely unclear. To fill in this gap, we provide a theoretical study on the inherent trade-off between CF and predictive performance in a model-agnostic manner. We first propose a simple but effective method to cast an optimal but potentially unfair predictor into a fair one without losing the optimality. By analyzing its excess risk in order to achieve CF, we quantify this inherent trade-off. Further analysis on our method's performance with access to only incomplete causal knowledge is also conducted. Built upon it, we propose a performant algorithm that can be applied in such scenarios. Experiments on both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the validity of our analysis and methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attention is a key part of the transformer architecture. It is a sequence-to-sequence mapping that transforms each sequence element into a weighted sum of values. The weights are typically obtained as the softmax of dot products between keys and queries. Recent work has explored alternatives to softmax attention in transformers, such as ReLU and sigmoid activations. In this work, we revisit sigmoid attention and conduct an in-depth theoretical and empirical analysis. Theoretically, we prove that transformers with sigmoid attention are universal function approximators and benefit from improved regularity compared to softmax attention. Through detailed empirical analysis, we identify stabilization of large initial attention norms during the early stages of training as a crucial factor for the successful training of models with sigmoid attention, outperforming prior attempts. We also introduce FLASHSIGMOID, a hardware-aware and memory-efficient implementation of sigmoid attention yielding a 17% inference kernel speed-up over FLASHATTENTION2 on H100 GPUs. Experiments across language, vision, and speech show that properly normalized sigmoid attention matches the strong performance of softmax attention on a wide range of domains and scales, which previous attempts at sigmoid attention were unable to fully achieve. Our work unifies prior art and establishes best practices for sigmoid attention as a drop-in softmax replacement in transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochun Niu, Lili Su, Jiaming Xu, Pengkun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative learning through latent shared feature representations enables heterogeneous clients to train personalized models with enhanced performance while reducing sample complexity. Despite its empirical success and extensive research, the theoretical understanding of statistical error rates remains incomplete, even for shared representations constrained to low-dimensional linear subspaces. In this paper, we establish new upper and lower bounds on the error for learning low-dimensional linear representations shared across clients. Our results account for both statistical heterogeneity (including covariate and concept shifts) and heterogeneity in local dataset sizes, a critical aspect often overlooked in previous studies. We further extend our error bounds to more general nonlinear models, including logistic regression and one-hidden-layer ReLU neural networks.
  More specifically, we design a spectral estimator that leverages independent replicas of local averaging to approximately solve the non-convex least squares problem. We derive a nearly matching minimax lower bound, proving that our estimator achieves the optimal statistical rate when the latent shared linear representation is well-represented across the entire dataset--that is, when no specific direction is disproportionately underrepresented. Our analysis reveals two distinct phases of the optimal rate: in typical cases, the rate matches the standard parameter-counting rate for the representation; however, a statistical penalty arises when the number of clients surpasses a certain threshold or the local dataset sizes fall below a threshold. These findings provide a more precise characterization of when collaboration benefits the overall system or individual clients in transfer learning and private fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread use of statistical prior models in various fields, such models for neural network gradients have long been overlooked. The inherent challenge stems from their high-dimensional structures and complex interdependencies, which complicate effective modeling. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient priors in a zero-shot setting. We examine the property by considering lossless gradient compression -- a critical application in distributed learning -- that depends heavily on precise probability modeling. To achieve this, we introduce LM-GC, a novel method that integrates LLMs with arithmetic coding. Our technique converts plain gradients into text-like formats, enhancing token efficiency by up to 38 times compared to their plain representations. We ensure that this data conversion maintains a close alignment with the structure of plain gradients and the symbols commonly recognized by LLMs. Our experiments indicate that LM-GC surpasses existing state-of-the-art lossless compression methods, improving compression rates by 10% up to 17.2% across various datasets and architectures. Additionally, our approach shows promising compatibility with lossy compression techniques such as quantization and sparsification. These findings highlight the significant potential of LLMs as a model for effectively handling gradients. Code is available at https://github.com/hui-po-wang/LM-GC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gen Li, Yuling Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based diffusion models, which generate new data by learning to reverse a diffusion process that perturbs data from the target distribution into noise, have achieved remarkable success across various generative tasks. Despite their superior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often constrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal assumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of the score functions, the total variation distance between the target and generated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic factors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps. This result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment. Moreover, we show that with careful coefficient design, the convergence rate improves to $O(k/T)$, where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target data distribution. This highlights the ability of DDPM to automatically adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures, a common feature of natural image distributions. These results are achieved through a novel set of analytical tools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates at each step of the reverse process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siva Viknesh, Younes Tatari, Amirhossein Arzani</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying dynamical systems characterized by nonlinear parameters presents significant challenges in deriving mathematical models that enhance understanding of physics. Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing equations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct advantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the SINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of established approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This facilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise parameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear characteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or polynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an integrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown variables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification procedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions. The performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum of dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction kinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations (wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of concurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by nonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to extend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex challenges in dynamical system identification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyan Zhao, Yiming Wang, Yuyang Chen, Yan Li, Leong Hou U, Xiaoguang Niu</p>
<p>Abstract: Experience replay is widely used to improve learning efficiency in reinforcement learning by leveraging past experiences. However, existing experience replay methods, whether based on uniform or prioritized sampling, often suffer from low efficiency, particularly in real-world scenarios with high-dimensional state spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach, Efficient Diversity-based Experience Replay (EDER). EDER employs a deterministic point process to model the diversity between samples and prioritizes replay based on the diversity between samples. To further enhance learning efficiency, we incorporate Cholesky decomposition for handling large state spaces in realistic environments. Additionally, rejection sampling is applied to select samples with higher diversity, thereby improving overall learning efficacy. Extensive experiments are conducted on robotic manipulation tasks in MuJoCo, Atari games, and realistic indoor environments in Habitat. The results demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves learning efficiency but also achieves superior performance in high-dimensional, realistic environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunjia Hu, Kevin Tian, Chutong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work on supervised learning [GKR+22] defined the notion of omnipredictors, i.e., predictor functions $p$ over features that are simultaneously competitive for minimizing a family of loss functions $\mathcal{L}$ against a comparator class $\mathcal{C}$. Omniprediction requires approximating the Bayes-optimal predictor beyond the loss minimization paradigm, and has generated significant interest in the learning theory community. However, even for basic settings such as agnostically learning single-index models (SIMs), existing omnipredictor constructions require impractically-large sample complexities and runtimes, and output complex, highly-improper hypotheses.
  Our main contribution is a new, simple construction of omnipredictors for SIMs. We give a learner outputting an omnipredictor that is $\varepsilon$-competitive on any matching loss induced by a monotone, Lipschitz link function, when the comparator class is bounded linear predictors. Our algorithm requires $\approx \varepsilon^{-4}$ samples and runs in nearly-linear time, and its sample complexity improves to $\approx \varepsilon^{-2}$ if link functions are bi-Lipschitz. This significantly improves upon the only prior known construction, due to [HJKRR18, GHK+23], which used $\gtrsim \varepsilon^{-10}$ samples.
  We achieve our construction via a new, sharp analysis of the classical Isotron algorithm [KS09, KKKS11] in the challenging agnostic learning setting, of potential independent interest. Previously, Isotron was known to properly learn SIMs in the realizable setting, as well as constant-factor competitive hypotheses under the squared loss [ZWDD24]. As they are based on Isotron, our omnipredictors are multi-index models with $\approx \varepsilon^{-2}$ prediction heads, bringing us closer to the tantalizing goal of proper omniprediction for general loss families and comparators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheng Li, Feng Xie, Xichen Guo, Yan Zeng, Hao Zhang, Zhi Geng</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating causal effects from nonexperimental data is a fundamental problem in many fields of science. A key component of this task is selecting an appropriate set of covariates for confounding adjustment to avoid bias. Most existing methods for covariate selection often assume the absence of latent variables and rely on learning the global network structure among variables. However, identifying the global structure can be unnecessary and inefficient, especially when our primary interest lies in estimating the effect of a treatment variable on an outcome variable. To address this limitation, we propose a novel local learning approach for covariate selection in nonparametric causal effect estimation, which accounts for the presence of latent variables. Our approach leverages testable independence and dependence relationships among observed variables to identify a valid adjustment set for a target causal relationship, ensuring both soundness and completeness under standard assumptions. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaohan Yu, Pan Deng, Yu Zhao, Junting Liu, Zi'ang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving fair prediction performance across nodes is crucial in the spatial-temporal domain, as it ensures the validity and reliability of forecasting outcomes. However, existing models focus primarily on improving the overall accuracy of the prediction, often neglecting the goal of achieving uniformity in the predictions. This task becomes particularly challenging due to the inherent spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the nodes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) for fair spatial-temporal forecasting. In particular, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN), which leverages the fusion of multi-graph and edge masking to flexibly model spatial dependencies. Moreover, we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE), which allocates prediction tasks of different nodes to suitable experts through graph decoupling routing. To further improve the model, fairness-aware loss and evaluation functions are proposed, optimizing the model with fairness and accuracy as objectives. Experiments on four datasets from different real-world scenarios demonstrate that HiMoE achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline with at lease 9.22% in all metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, offering enhanced model capacity and computational efficiency through conditional computation. However, deploying and running inference on these models presents significant challenges in computational resources, latency, and energy efficiency. This comprehensive survey analyzes optimization techniques for MoE models across the entire system stack. We first establish a taxonomical framework that categorizes optimization approaches into model-level, system-level, and hardware-level optimizations. At the model level, we examine architectural innovations including efficient expert design, attention mechanisms, various compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, as well as algorithm improvement including dynamic routing strategies and expert merging methods. At the system level, we investigate distributed computing approaches, load balancing mechanisms, and efficient scheduling algorithms that enable scalable deployment. Furthermore, we delve into hardware-specific optimizations and co-design strategies that maximize throughput and energy efficiency. This survey provides both a structured overview of existing solutions and identifies key challenges and promising research directions in MoE inference optimization. To facilitate ongoing updates and the sharing of cutting-edge advances in MoE inference optimization research, we have established a repository accessible at https://github.com/MoE-Inf/awesome-moe-inference/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadreza Nakhaei, Aidan Scannell, Joni Pajarinen</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline meta-reinforcement learning aims to equip agents with the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks by training on data from a set of different tasks. Context-based approaches utilize a history of state-action-reward transitions -- referred to as the context -- to infer representations of the current task, and then condition the agent, i.e., the policy and value function, on the task representations. Intuitively, the better the task representations capture the underlying tasks, the better the agent can generalize to new tasks. Unfortunately, context-based approaches suffer from distribution mismatch, as the context in the offline data does not match the context at test time, limiting their ability to generalize to the test tasks. This leads to the task representations overfitting to the offline training data. Intuitively, the task representations should be independent of the behavior policy used to collect the offline data. To address this issue, we approximately minimize the mutual information between the distribution over the task representations and behavior policy by maximizing the entropy of behavior policy conditioned on the task representations. We validate our approach in MuJoCo environments, showing that compared to baselines, our task representations more faithfully represent the underlying tasks, leading to outperforming prior methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohuan Hu, Richard Yu, Zizhou Zhang, Haoran Zheng, Qianying Liu, Yining Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast and analyze financial time series. The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant technique to provide \emph{Large Language Models} (LLM) with fresh and relevant context, mitigating the risk of hallucinations and improving the overall quality of responses in environments with large and fast moving knowledge bases. However, the integration of external documents into the generation process raises significant privacy concerns. Indeed, when added to a prompt, it is not possible to guarantee a response will not inadvertently expose confidential data, leading to potential breaches of privacy and ethical dilemmas. This paper explores a practical solution to this problem suitable to general knowledge extraction from personal data. It shows \emph{differentially private token generation} is a viable approach to private RAG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhieddine Shebaro, Jelena Te\v{s}i\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Representation Learning aims to create effective embeddings for nodes and edges that encapsulate their features and relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage neural networks to model complex graph structures. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), offering improved accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose the integration of KANs into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs), leading to the development of KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN). We evaluate KASGCN on tasks such as signed community detection and link sign prediction to improve embedding quality in signed networks. Our experimental results indicate that KASGCN exhibits competitive or comparable performance to standard SGCNs across the tasks evaluated, with performance variability depending on the specific characteristics of the signed graph and the choice of parameter settings. These findings suggest that KASGCNs hold promise for enhancing signed graph analysis with context-dependent effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keita Kinjo</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, explainability in machine learning has gained importance. In this context, counterfactual explanation (CE), which is an explanation method that uses examples, has attracted attention. However, it has been pointed out that CE is not robust when there are multiple machine-learning models. These problems are important when using machine learning to make safe decisions. In this paper, we propose robust CEs that introduce a new viewpoint - Pareto improvement - and a method that uses multi-objective optimization to generate it. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and actual data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and useful. We believe that this research will contribute to a wide range of research areas, such as explainability in machine learning, decision-making, and action planning based on machine learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Divya Shanmugam, Shuvom Sadhuka, Manish Raghavan, John Guttag, Bonnie Berger, Emma Pierson</p>
<p>Abstract: It remains difficult to evaluate machine learning classifiers in the absence of a large, labeled dataset. While labeled data can be prohibitively expensive or impossible to obtain, unlabeled data is plentiful. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Model Evaluation (SSME), a method that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to evaluate machine learning classifiers. SSME is the first evaluation method to take advantage of the fact that: (i) there are frequently multiple classifiers for the same task, (ii) continuous classifier scores are often available for all classes, and (iii) unlabeled data is often far more plentiful than labeled data. The key idea is to use a semi-supervised mixture model to estimate the joint distribution of ground truth labels and classifier predictions. We can then use this model to estimate any metric that is a function of classifier scores and ground truth labels (e.g., accuracy or expected calibration error). We present experiments in four domains where obtaining large labeled datasets is often impractical: (1) healthcare, (2) content moderation, (3) molecular property prediction, and (4) image annotation. Our results demonstrate that SSME estimates performance more accurately than do competing methods, reducing error by 5.1x relative to using labeled data alone and 2.4x relative to the next best competing method. SSME also improves accuracy when evaluating performance across subsets of the test distribution (e.g., specific demographic subgroups) and when evaluating the performance of language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Xiao, Xinhai Chen, Qingling Wang, Jie Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mesh generation plays a crucial role in scientific computing. Traditional mesh generation methods, such as TFI and PDE-based methods, often struggle to achieve a balance between efficiency and mesh quality. To address this challenge, physics-informed intelligent learning methods have recently emerged, significantly improving generation efficiency while maintaining high mesh quality. However, physics-informed methods fail to generalize when applied to previously unseen geometries, as even small changes in the boundary shape necessitate burdensome retraining to adapt to new geometric variations. In this paper, we introduce MeshONet, the first generalizable intelligent learning method for structured mesh generation. The method transforms the mesh generation task into an operator learning problem with multiple input and solution functions. To effectively overcome the multivariable mapping restriction of operator learning methods, we propose a dual-branch, shared-trunk architecture to approximate the mapping between function spaces based on input-output pairs. Experimental results show that MeshONet achieves a speedup of up to four orders of magnitude in generation efficiency over traditional methods. It also enables generalization to different geometries without retraining, greatly enhancing the practicality of intelligent methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keon Vin Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimizing portfolio performance is a fundamental challenge in financial modeling, requiring the integration of advanced clustering techniques and data-driven optimization strategies. This paper introduces a comparative backtesting approach that combines clustering-based portfolio segmentation and Sharpe ratio-based optimization to enhance investment decision-making. First, we segment a diverse set of financial assets into clusters based on their historical log-returns using K-Means clustering. This segmentation enables the grouping of assets with similar return characteristics, facilitating targeted portfolio construction. Next, for each cluster, we apply a Sharpe ratio-based optimization model to derive optimal weights that maximize risk-adjusted returns. Unlike traditional mean-variance optimization, this approach directly incorporates the trade-off between returns and volatility, resulting in a more balanced allocation of resources within each cluster. The proposed framework is evaluated through a backtesting study using historical data spanning multiple asset classes. Optimized portfolios for each cluster are constructed and their cumulative returns are compared over time against a traditional equal-weighted benchmark portfolio.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate power forecasting from renewable energy sources (RES) is crucial for integrating additional RES capacity into the power system and realizing sustainability goals. This work emphasizes the importance of integrating decentralized spatio-temporal data into forecasting models. However, decentralized data ownership presents a critical obstacle to the success of such spatio-temporal models, and incentive mechanisms to foster data-sharing need to be considered. The main contributions are a) a comparative analysis of the forecasting models, advocating for efficient and interpretable spline LASSO regression models, and b) a bidding mechanism within the data/analytics market to ensure fair compensation for data providers and enable both buyers and sellers to express their data price requirements. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism for time series forecasting is proposed, effectively incorporating price constraints and preventing redundant feature allocation. Results show significant accuracy improvements and potential monetary gains for data sellers. For wind power data, an average root mean squared error improvement of over 10% was achieved by comparing forecasts generated by the proposal with locally generated ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyal Neuman, Yufei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems in which an agent liquidates a risky asset while creating both transient price impact driven by an unknown convolution propagator and linear temporary price impact with an unknown parameter. We characterize the trader's performance as maximization of a revenue-risk functional, where the trader also exploits available information on a price predicting signal. We present a trading algorithm that alternates between exploration and exploitation phases and achieves sublinear regrets with high probability. For the exploration phase we propose a novel approach for non-parametric estimation of the price impact kernel by observing only the visible price process and derive sharp bounds on the convergence rate, which are characterised by the singularity of the propagator. These kernel estimation methods extend existing methods from the area of Tikhonov regularisation for inverse problems and are of independent interest. The bound on the regret in the exploitation phase is obtained by deriving stability results for the optimizer and value function of the associated class of infinite-dimensional stochastic control problems. As a complementary result we propose a regression-based algorithm to estimate the conditional expectation of non-Markovian signals and derive its convergence rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqian Xing, JungHo Lee, Chong Liu, Shixiang Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) has become increasingly relevant for tackling complex decision-making problems, especially in public policy domains such as police redistricting. However, its broader application in public policymaking is hindered by the complexity of defining feasible regions and the high-dimensionality of decisions. This paper introduces a novel BBO framework, termed as the Conditional And Generative Black-box Optimization (CageBO). This approach leverages a conditional variational autoencoder to learn the distribution of feasible decisions, enabling a two-way mapping between the original decision space and a simplified, constraint-free latent space. The CageBO efficiently handles the implicit constraints often found in public policy applications, allowing for optimization in the latent space while evaluating objectives in the original space. We validate our method through a case study on large-scale police redistricting problems in Atlanta, Georgia. Our results reveal that our CageBO offers notable improvements in performance and efficiency compared to the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Muchen Sun, Ayush Gaggar, Peter Trautman, Todd Murphey</p>
<p>Abstract: Ergodic search enables optimal exploration of an information distribution while guaranteeing the asymptotic coverage of the search space. However, current methods typically have exponential computation complexity in the search space dimension and are restricted to Euclidean space. We introduce a computationally efficient ergodic search method. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we develop a kernel-based ergodic metric and generalize it from Euclidean space to Lie groups. We formally prove the proposed metric is consistent with the standard ergodic metric while guaranteeing linear complexity in the search space dimension. Secondly, we derive the first-order optimality condition of the kernel ergodic metric for nonlinear systems, which enables efficient trajectory optimization. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks show that the proposed method is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed algorithm with a peg-in-hole insertion task. We formulate the problem as a coverage task in the space of SE(3) and use a 30-second-long human demonstration as the prior distribution for ergodic coverage. Ergodicity guarantees the asymptotic solution of the peg-in-hole problem so long as the solution resides within the prior information distribution, which is seen in the 100% success rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengyang Shao, Yonghui Yang, Chen Gao, Lei Chen, Kun Zhang, Chenyi Zhuang, Le Wu, Yong Li, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has attracted much research interest due to its strong ability on inferring students' proficiency levels on knowledge concepts. While graph-based CD models have demonstrated remarkable performance, we contend that they still cannot achieve optimal performance due to the neglect of edge heterogeneity and uncertainty. Edges involve both correct and incorrect response logs, indicating heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a response log can have uncertain semantic meanings, e.g., a correct log can indicate true mastery or fortunate guessing, and a wrong log can indicate a lack of understanding or a careless mistake. In this paper, we propose an Informative Semantic-aware Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (ISG-CD), which focuses on how to utilize the heterogeneous graph in CD and minimize effects of uncertain edges. Specifically, to explore heterogeneity, we propose a semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model. To minimize effects of edge uncertainty, we propose an Informative Edge Differentiation layer from an information bottleneck perspective, which suggests keeping a minimal yet sufficient reliable graph for CD in an unsupervised way. We formulate this process as maximizing mutual information between the reliable graph and response logs, while minimizing mutual information between the reliable graph and the original graph. After that, we prove that mutual information maximization can be theoretically converted to the classic binary cross entropy loss function, while minimizing mutual information can be realized by the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Finally, we adopt an alternating training strategy for optimizing learnable parameters of both the semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model and the edge differentiation layer. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of ISG-CD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging large-scale Text-to-Image (TTI) models have become a common technique for generating exemplar or training dataset in the fields of image synthesis, video editing, 3D reconstruction. However, semantic structural visual hallucinations involving perceptually severe defects remain a concern, especially in the domain of non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) such as cartoons and pixelization-style character. To detect these hallucinations in NPR, We propose a novel semantic structural hallucination detection system using Vision-Language Model (VLM). Our approach is to leverage the emerging capability of large language model, in-context learning which denotes that VLM has seen some examples by user for specific downstream task, here hallucination detection. Based on in-context learning, we introduce pose-aware in-context visual learning (PA-ICVL) which improve the overall performance of VLM by further inputting visual data beyond prompts, RGB images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. Within selected two VLMs, GPT-4v, Gemini pro vision, our proposed PA-ICVL improves the hallucination detection with 50% to 78%, 57% to 80%, respectively. This research advances a capability of TTI models toward real-world applications by mitigating visual hallucinations via in-context visual learning, expanding their potential in non-photorealistic domains. In addition, it showcase how users can boost the downstream-specialized capability of open VLM by harnessing additional conditions. We collect synthetic cartoon-hallucination dataset with TTI models, this dataset and final tuned VLM will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abrar Jahin, Saleh Akram Naife, Fatema Tuj Johora Lima, M. F. Mridha, Jungpil Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Domestic violence is commonly viewed as a gendered issue that primarily affects women, which tends to leave male victims largely overlooked. This study explores male domestic violence (MDV) for the first time, highlighting the factors that influence it and tackling the challenges posed by a significant categorical imbalance of 5:1 and a lack of data. We collected data from nine major cities in Bangladesh and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying dynamics. EDA revealed patterns such as the high prevalence of verbal abuse, the influence of financial dependency, and the role of familial and socio-economic factors in MDV. To predict and analyze MDV, we implemented 10 traditional machine learning (ML) models, three deep learning models, and two ensemble models, including stacking and hybrid approaches. We propose a stacking ensemble model with ANN and CatBoost as base classifiers and Logistic Regression as the meta-model, which demonstrated the best performance, achieving 95% accuracy, a 99.29% AUC, and balanced metrics across evaluation criteria. Model-specific feature importance analysis of the base classifiers identified key features influencing their individual decision-making. Model-agnostic explainable AI techniques, SHAP and LIME, provided local and global insights into the decision-making processes of the proposed model, enhancing transparency and interpretability. Additionally, statistical validation using paired t-tests with 10-fold cross-validation and Bonferroni correction (alpha = 0.0036) confirmed the superior performance of our proposed model over alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Shahab Sepehri, Zalan Fabian, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi</p>
<p>Abstract: The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Chen, Micah Goldblum, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning, also known as lifelong learning or incremental learning, refers to the process by which a model learns from a stream of incoming data over time. A common problem in continual learning is the classification layer's bias towards the most recent task. Traditionally, methods have relied on incorporating data from past tasks during training to mitigate this issue. However, the recent shift in continual learning to memory-free environments has rendered these approaches infeasible. In this study, we propose a solution focused on the testing phase. We first introduce a simple Out-of-Task Detection method, OTD, designed to accurately identify samples from past tasks during testing. Leveraging OTD, we then propose: (1) an Adaptive Retention mechanism for dynamically tuning the classifier layer on past task data; (2) an Adaptive Correction mechanism for revising predictions when the model classifies data from previous tasks into classes from the current task. We name our approach Adaptive Retention & Correction (ARC). While designed for memory-free environments, ARC also proves effective in memory-based settings. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can be plugged in to virtually any existing continual learning approach without requiring any modifications to its training procedure. Specifically, when integrated with state-of-the-art approaches, ARC achieves an average performance increase of 2.7% and 2.6% on the CIFAR-100 and Imagenet-R datasets, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huaiguang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of machine learning models is crucial for ensuring trustworthy machine learning. Data Shapley, a landmark study on data valuation, advances this understanding by assessing the contribution of each datum to model performance. However, the resource-intensive and time-consuming nature of multiple model retraining poses challenges for applying Data Shapley to large datasets. To address this, we propose the CHG (compound of Hardness and Gradient) utility function, which approximates the utility of each data subset on model performance in every training epoch. By deriving the closed-form Shapley value for each data point using the CHG utility function, we reduce the computational complexity to that of a single model retraining, achieving a quadratic improvement over existing marginal contribution-based methods. We further leverage CHG Shapley for real-time data selection, conducting experiments across three settings: standard datasets, label noise datasets, and class imbalance datasets. These experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying high-value and noisy data. By enabling efficient data valuation, CHG Shapley promotes trustworthy model training through a novel data-centric perspective.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10994">Panza: Design and Analysis of a Fully-Local Personalized Text Writing Assistant</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Armand Nicolicioiu, Eugenia Iofinova, Eldar Kurtic, Mahdi Nikdan, Andrei Panferov, Ilia Markov, Nir Shavit, Dan Alistarh</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of powerful open-source large language models (LLMs) opens exciting use cases, such as automated personal assistants that adapt to the user's unique data and demands. Two key requirements for such assistants are personalization - in the sense that the assistant should reflect the user's own writing style - and privacy - users may prefer to always store their personal data locally, on their own computing device. In this application paper, we present a new design and evaluation for such an automated assistant, for the specific use case of email generation, which we call Panza. Specifically, Panza can be trained and deployed locally on commodity hardware, and is personalized to the user's writing style. Panza's personalization features are based on a combination of fine-tuning using a variant of the Reverse Instructions technique together with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We demonstrate that this combination allows us to fine-tune an LLM to better reflect a user's writing style using limited data, while executing on extremely limited resources, e.g. on a free Google Colab instance. Our key methodological contribution is what we believe to be the first detailed study of evaluation metrics for this personalized writing task, and of how different choices of system components - e.g. the use of RAG and of different fine-tuning approaches - impact the system's performance. We are releasing the full Panza code as well as a new "David" personalized email dataset licensed for research use, both available on https://github.com/IST-DASLab/PanzaMail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabiul Awal, Saba Ahmadi, Le Zhang, Aishwarya Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained understanding of objects, attributes, and relationships between objects is crucial for visual-language models (VLMs). Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar captions given an image. In this paper, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed Visual Minimal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions. The image pair and caption pair contain minimal changes, i.e., only one aspect changes at a time from among the following: object, attribute, count, and spatial relation. These changes test the models' understanding of objects, attributes (such as color, material, shape), counts, and spatial relationships between objects. We built an automatic framework using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators. Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities. We also generate a large-scale training dataset to finetune CLIP and Idefics2, showing significant improvements in fine-grained understanding across benchmarks and in CLIP's general image-text alignment. We release all resources, including the benchmark, training data, and finetuned model checkpoints, at https://vismin.net/.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop a machine learning method for mapping data originating from both Standard Model processes and various theories beyond the Standard Model into a unified representation (latent) space while conserving information about the relationship between the underlying theories. We apply our method to three examples of new physics at the LHC of increasing complexity, showing that models can be clustered according to their LHC phenomenology: different models are mapped to distinct regions in latent space, while indistinguishable models are mapped to the same region. This opens interesting new avenues on several fronts, such as model discrimination, selection of representative benchmark scenarios, and identifying gaps in the coverage of model space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Di Salvo, Sebastian Doerrich, Ines Rieger, Christian Ledig</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks scales with dataset size and label quality, rendering the efficient mitigation of low-quality data annotations crucial for building robust and cost-effective systems. Existing strategies to address label noise exhibit severe limitations due to computational complexity and application dependency. In this work, we propose WANN, a Weighted Adaptive Nearest Neighbor approach that builds on self-supervised feature representations obtained from foundation models. To guide the weighted voting scheme, we introduce a reliability score, which measures the likelihood of a data label being correct. WANN outperforms reference methods, including a linear layer trained with robust loss functions, on diverse datasets of varying size and under various noise types and severities. WANN also exhibits superior generalization on imbalanced data compared to both Adaptive-NNs (ANN) and fixed k-NNs. Furthermore, the proposed weighting scheme enhances supervised dimensionality reduction under noisy labels. This yields a significant boost in classification performance with 10x and 100x smaller image embeddings, minimizing latency and storage requirements. Our approach, emphasizing efficiency and explainability, emerges as a simple, robust solution to overcome inherent limitations of deep neural network training.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07448">Introducing Perturb-ability Score (PS) to Enhance Robustness Against Problem-Space Evasion Adversarial Attacks on Flow-based ML-NIDS</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed elShehaby, Ashraf Matrawy</p>
<p>Abstract: As network security threats continue to evolve, safeguarding Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) from adversarial attacks is crucial. This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and presents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS) metric that identifies NIDS features susceptible to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. By quantifying a feature's susceptibility to perturbations within the problem-space, the PS facilitates the selection of features that are inherently more robust against evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS during the feature selection phase. These features exhibit natural resilience to perturbations, as they are heavily constrained by the problem-space limitations and correlations of the NIDS domain. Furthermore, manipulating these features may either disrupt the malicious function of evasion adversarial attacks on NIDS or render the network traffic invalid for processing (or both). This proposed novel approach employs a fresh angle by leveraging network domain constraints as a defense mechanism against problem-space evasion adversarial attacks targeting ML-NIDS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-guided feature selection defense in enhancing NIDS robustness. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS models and public datasets show that selecting only robust features (low-PS features) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks. Additionally, our findings verify that the PS effectively identifies NIDS features highly vulnerable to problem-space perturbations.</p>

We show that, when the lower probabilities are the lower envelopes of $\epsilon$-contaminated sets, then our version of Monge's, and a restricted version of our Kantorovich's problems, coincide with their respective classical versions. We also give sufficient conditions for the existence of our version of Kantorovich's optimal plan, and for the two problems to be equivalent. As a byproduct, we show that for $\epsilon$-contaminations the lower probability versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems need not coincide. The applications of our results to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are also discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models have drastically changed the prospects of AI by introducing technologies for more complex natural language processing. However, current methodologies to train such LLMs require extensive resources including but not limited to large amounts of data, expensive machinery, and lengthy training. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new tokenization method inspired by universal Lempel-Ziv-Welch data compression that compresses repetitive phrases into multi-word tokens. With MultiTok as a new tokenizing tool, we show that language models are able to be trained notably more efficiently while offering a similar accuracy on more succinct and compressed training data. In fact, our results demonstrate that MultiTok achieves a comparable performance to the BERT and GPT-2 standards as both a stand-alone tokenizer and an add-on to existing tokenizers while also providing close to 2.5x faster training with more than 30% less training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising results in generating near-optimal solutions without the need for expert-crafted heuristics. However, high performance of these approaches often rely on problem-specific human-expertise-based search after generating candidate solutions, limiting their applicability to commonly solved CO problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this paper, we present IC/DC, an unsupervised CO framework that directly trains a diffusion model from scratch. We train our model in a self-supervised way to minimize the cost of the solution while adhering to the problem-specific constraints. IC/DC is specialized in addressing CO problems involving two distinct sets of items, and it does not need problem-specific search processes to generate valid solutions. IC/DC employs a novel architecture capable of capturing the intricate relationships between items, and thereby enabling effective optimization in challenging CO scenarios. IC/DC achieves state-of-the-art performance relative to existing NCO methods on the Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (PMSP) and Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP).</p>

<p>Abstract: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications.

<p>Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masahiro Kato</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates an asymptotically minimax optimal algorithm in the two-armed fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI) problem. Given two treatment arms, the objective is to identify the arm with the highest expected outcome through an adaptive experiment. We focus on the Neyman allocation, where treatment arms are allocated following the ratio of their outcome standard deviations. Our primary contribution is to prove the minimax optimality of the Neyman allocation for the simple regret, defined as the difference between the expected outcomes of the true best arm and the estimated best arm. Specifically, we first derive a minimax lower bound for the expected simple regret, which characterizes the worst-case performance achievable under the location-shift distributions, including Gaussian distributions. We then show that the simple regret of the Neyman allocation asymptotically matches this lower bound, including the constant term, not just the rate in terms of the sample size, under the worst-case distribution. Notably, our optimality result holds without imposing locality restrictions on the distribution, such as the local asymptotic normality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Neyman allocation reduces to the uniform allocation, i.e., the standard randomized controlled trial, under Bernoulli distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tara Radvand, Mojtaba Abdolmaleki, Mohamed Mostagir, Ambuj Tewari</p>
<p>Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly difficult as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that the type I and type II errors for our tests decrease exponentially in the text length. In designing our tests, we derive concentration inequalities on the difference between log-perplexity and the average entropy of the string under $A$. Specifically, for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. Lastly, we present preliminary experimental results to support our theoretical results. By enabling guaranteed (with high probability) finding of the origin of harmful LLM-generated text with arbitrary size, we can help combat misinformation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haichao Zhang, Haonan Yu, Le Zhao, Andrew Choi, Qinxun Bai, Break Yang, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a low-cost legged mobile manipulation system that solves long-horizon real-world tasks, trained by reinforcement learning purely in simulation. This system is made possible by 1) a hierarchical design of a high-level policy for visual-mobile manipulation following instructions and a low-level policy for quadruped movement and limb control, 2) a progressive exploration and learning approach that leverages privileged task decomposition information to train the teacher policy for long-horizon tasks, which will guide an imitation-based student policy for efficient training of the high-level visuomotor policy, and 3) a suite of techniques for minimizing sim-to-real gaps.
  In contrast to previous approaches that use high-end equipment, our system demonstrates effective performance with more accessible hardware - specifically, a Unitree Go1 quadruped, a WidowX250S arm, and a single wrist-mounted RGB camera - despite the increased challenges of sim-to-real transfer. When fully trained in simulation, a single policy autonomously solves long-horizon tasks such as search, move, grasp, and drop-into, achieving nearly 80% success. This performance is comparable to that of expert human teleoperation on the same tasks but operates in a more efficient way, at 1.5 times the speed of human expert. The sim-to-real transfer is fluid across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes under varying lighting conditions. Finally, we discuss the key techniques that enable the entire pipeline, including efficient RL training and sim-to-real, to work effectively for legged mobile manipulation, and present their ablation results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungjae Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Lee and Seung (2000) introduced numerical solutions for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) using iterative multiplicative update algorithms. These algorithms have been actively utilized as dimensionality reduction tools for high-dimensional non-negative data and learning algorithms for artificial neural networks. Despite a considerable amount of literature on the applications of the NMF algorithms, detailed explanations about their formulation and derivation are lacking. This report provides supplementary details to help understand the formulation and derivation of the proofs as used in the original paper.</p>

<p>Abstract: Delivering an immersive experience to virtual reality (VR) users through wireless connectivity offers the freedom to engage from anywhere at any time. Nevertheless, it is challenging to ensure seamless wireless connectivity that delivers real-time and high-quality videos to the VR users. This paper proposes a field of view (FoV) aware caching for mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled wireless VR network. In particular, the FoV of each VR user is cached/prefetched at the base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. Specifically, decentralized and personalized federated learning (DP-FL) based caching strategies with guarantees are presented. Considering VR systems composed of multiple VR devices and BSs, a DP-FL caching algorithm is implemented at each BS to personalize content delivery for VR users. The utilized DP-FL algorithm guarantees a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the conditional average cache hit. Further, to reduce the cost of communicating gradients, one-bit quantization of the stochastic gradient descent (OBSGD) is proposed, and a convergence guarantee of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ is obtained for the proposed algorithm, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Additionally, to better account for the wireless channel dynamics, the FoVs are grouped into multicast or unicast groups based on the number of requesting VR users. The performance of the proposed DP-FL algorithm is validated through realistic VR head-tracking dataset, and the proposed algorithm is shown to have better performance in terms of average delay and cache hit as compared to baseline algorithms.</p>
