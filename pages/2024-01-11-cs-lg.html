<p>A key concern of automatic process discovery is to provide insights into
performance aspects of business processes. Waiting times are of particular
importance in this context. For that reason, it is surprising that current
techniques for automatic process discovery generate directly-follows graphs and
comparable process models, but often miss the opportunity to explicitly
represent the time axis. In this paper, we present an approach for
automatically constructing process models that explicitly align with a time
axis. We exemplify our approach for directly-follows graphs. Our evaluation
using two BPIC datasets and a proprietary dataset highlight the benefits of
this representation in comparison to standard layout techniques.

<p>Dark patterns are deceptive user interface designs for online services that
make users behave in unintended ways. Dark patterns, such as privacy invasion,
financial loss, and emotional distress, can harm users. These issues have been
the subject of considerable debate in recent years. In this paper, we study
interpretable dark pattern auto-detection, that is, why a particular user
interface is detected as having dark patterns. First, we trained a model using
transformer-based pre-trained language models, BERT, on a text-based dataset
for the automatic detection of dark patterns in e-commerce. Then, we applied
post-hoc explanation techniques, including local interpretable model agnostic
explanation (LIME) and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), to the trained
model, which revealed which terms influence each prediction as a dark pattern.
In addition, we extracted and analyzed terms that affected the dark patterns.
Our findings may prevent users from being manipulated by dark patterns, and aid
in the construction of more equitable internet services. Our code is available

<p>Accurate weather forecasting holds significant importance to human
activities. Currently, there are two paradigms for weather forecasting:
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and Deep Learning-based Prediction (DLP).
NWP utilizes atmospheric physics for weather modeling but suffers from poor
data utilization and high computational costs, while DLP can learn weather
patterns from vast amounts of data directly but struggles to incorporate
physical laws. Both paradigms possess their respective strengths and
weaknesses, and are incompatible, because physical laws adopted in NWP describe
the relationship between coordinates and meteorological variables, while DLP
directly learns the relationships between meteorological variables without
consideration of coordinates. To address these problems, we introduce the
DeepPhysiNet framework, incorporating physical laws into deep learning models
for accurate and continuous weather system modeling. First, we construct
physics networks based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for individual
meteorological variable, such as temperature, pressure, and wind speed. Physics
networks establish relationships between variables and coordinates by taking
coordinates as input and producing variable values as output. The physical laws
in the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) can be incorporated as a
part of loss function. Next, we construct hyper-networks based on deep learning
methods to directly learn weather patterns from a large amount of
meteorological data. The output of hyper-networks constitutes a part of the
weights for the physics networks. Experimental results demonstrate that, upon
successful integration of physical laws, DeepPhysiNet can accomplish multiple
tasks simultaneously, not only enhancing forecast accuracy but also obtaining
continuous spatiotemporal resolution results, which is unattainable by either
the NWP or DLP.

<p>Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods such as LoRA, Adapter, and Visual
Prompt Tuning (VPT) have found success in enabling adaptation to new domains by
tuning small modules within a transformer model. However, the number of domains
encountered during test time can be very large, and the data is usually
unlabeled. Thus, adaptation to new domains is challenging; it is also
impractical to generate customized tuned modules for each such domain. Toward
addressing these challenges, this work introduces PLUTO: a Plug-and-pLay
modUlar Test-time domain adaptatiOn strategy. We pre-train a large set of
modules, each specialized for different source domains, effectively creating a
``module store''. Given a target domain with few-shot unlabeled data, we
introduce an unsupervised test-time adaptation (TTA) method to (1) select a
sparse subset of relevant modules from this store and (2) create a weighted
combination of selected modules without tuning their weights. This
plug-and-play nature enables us to harness multiple most-relevant source
domains in a single inference call. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
PLUTO uniformly outperforms alternative TTA methods and that selecting $\leq$5
modules suffice to extract most of the benefit. At a high level, our method
equips pre-trained transformers with the capability to dynamically adapt to new
domains, motivating a new paradigm for efficient and scalable domain
adaptation.

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in various domains, from detecting
e-commerce spam to social network classification problems. However, the lack of
public graph datasets hampers research progress, particularly in heterogeneous
information networks (HIN). The demand for datasets for fair HIN comparisons is
growing due to advancements in GNN interpretation models. In response, we
propose SynHIN, a unique method for generating synthetic heterogeneous
information networks. SynHIN identifies motifs in real-world datasets,
summarizes graph statistics, and constructs a synthetic network. Our approach
utilizes In-Cluster and Out-Cluster Merge modules to build the synthetic HIN
from primary motif clusters. After In/Our-Cluster mergers and a post-pruning
process fitting the real dataset constraints, we ensure the synthetic graph
statistics align closely with the reference one. SynHIN generates a synthetic
heterogeneous graph dataset for node classification tasks, using the primary
motif as the explanation ground truth. It can adapt and address the lack of
heterogeneous graph datasets and motif ground truths, proving beneficial for
assessing heterogeneous graph neural network explainers. We further present a
benchmark dataset for future heterogeneous graph explainer model research. Our
work marks a significant step towards explainable AI in HGNNs.

<p>Traffic flow prediction plays a crucial role in alleviating traffic
congestion and enhancing transport efficiency. While combining graph
convolution networks with recurrent neural networks for spatial-temporal
modeling is a common strategy in this realm, the restricted structure of
recurrent neural networks limits their ability to capture global information.
For spatial modeling, many prior studies learn a graph structure that is
assumed to be fixed and uniform at all time steps, which may not be true. This
paper introduces a novel traffic prediction framework, Global-Aware Enhanced
Spatial-Temporal Graph Recurrent Network (GA-STGRN), comprising two core
components: a spatial-temporal graph recurrent neural network and a global
awareness layer. Within this framework, three innovative prediction models are
formulated. A sequence-aware graph neural network is proposed and integrated
into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to learn non-fixed graphs at different time
steps and capture local temporal relationships. To enhance the model's global
perception, three distinct global spatial-temporal transformer-like
architectures (GST^2) are devised for the global awareness layer. We conduct
extensive experiments on four real traffic datasets and the results demonstrate
the superiority of our framework and the three concrete models.

<p>This study introduces CCNETS (Causal Learning with Causal Cooperative Nets),
a novel generative model-based classifier designed to tackle the challenge of
generating data for imbalanced datasets in pattern recognition. CCNETS is
uniquely crafted to emulate brain-like information processing and comprises
three main components: Explainer, Producer, and Reasoner. Each component is
designed to mimic specific brain functions, which aids in generating
high-quality datasets and enhancing classification performance.
</p>
<p>The model is particularly focused on addressing the common and significant
challenge of handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning. CCNETS's
effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to a "fraud dataset,"
where normal transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones (99.83% vs.
0.17%). Traditional methods often struggle with such imbalances, leading to
skewed performance metrics. However, CCNETS exhibits superior classification
ability, as evidenced by its performance metrics. Specifically, it achieved an
F1-score of 0.7992, outperforming traditional models like Autoencoders and
Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) in the same context. This performance indicates
CCNETS's proficiency in more accurately distinguishing between normal and
fraudulent patterns.
</p>
<p>The innovative structure of CCNETS enhances the coherence between generative
and classification models, helping to overcome the limitations of pattern
recognition that rely solely on generative models. This study emphasizes
CCNETS's potential in diverse applications, especially where quality data
generation and pattern recognition are key. It proves effective in machine
learning, particularly for imbalanced datasets. CCNETS overcomes current
challenges in these datasets and advances machine learning with brain-inspired
approaches.

<p>The fractal dimension provides a statistical index of object complexity by
studying how the pattern changes with the measuring scale. Although useful in
several classification tasks, the fractal dimension is under-explored in deep
learning applications. In this work, we investigate the features that are
learned by deep models and we study whether these deep networks are able to
encode features as complex and high-level as the fractal dimensions.
Specifically, we conduct a correlation analysis experiment to show that deep
networks are not able to extract such a feature in none of their layers. We
combine our analytical study with a human evaluation to investigate the
differences between deep learning networks and models that operate on the
fractal feature solely. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of fractal features
in applications where the object structure is crucial for the classification
task. We empirically show that training a shallow network on fractal features
achieves performance comparable, even superior in specific cases, to that of
deep networks trained on raw data while requiring less computational resources.
Fractals improved the accuracy of the classification by 30% on average while
requiring up to 84% less time to train. We couple our empirical study with a
complexity analysis of the computational cost of extracting the proposed
fractal features, and we study its limitation.

<p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have recently shown promise in path
planning tasks. However, when dealing with global planning tasks, these methods
face serious challenges such as poor convergence and generalization. To this
end, we propose an attention-enhanced DRL method called LOPA (Learn Once Plan
Arbitrarily) in this paper. Firstly, we analyze the reasons of these problems
from the perspective of DRL's observation, revealing that the traditional
design causes DRL to be interfered by irrelevant map information. Secondly, we
develop the LOPA which utilizes a novel attention-enhanced mechanism to attain
an improved attention capability towards the key information of the
observation. Such a mechanism is realized by two steps: (1) an attention model
is built to transform the DRL's observation into two dynamic views: local and
global, significantly guiding the LOPA to focus on the key information on the
given maps; (2) a dual-channel network is constructed to process these two
views and integrate them to attain an improved reasoning capability. The LOPA
is validated via multi-objective global path planning experiments. The result
suggests the LOPA has improved convergence and generalization performance as
well as great path planning efficiency.

<p>Accurate spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting is crucial in aiding
traffic managers in implementing control measures and assisting drivers in
selecting optimal travel routes. Traditional deep-learning based methods for
traffic flow forecasting typically rely on historical data to train their
models, which are then used to make predictions on future data. However, the
performance of the trained model usually degrades due to the temporal drift
between the historical and future data. To make the model trained on historical
data better adapt to future data in a fully online manner, this paper conducts
the first study of the online test-time adaptation techniques for
spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting problems. To this end, we propose an
Adaptive Double Correction by Series Decomposition (ADCSD) method, which first
decomposes the output of the trained model into seasonal and trend-cyclical
parts and then corrects them by two separate modules during the testing phase
using the latest observed data entry by entry. In the proposed ADCSD method,
instead of fine-tuning the whole trained model during the testing phase, a lite
network is attached after the trained model, and only the lite network is
fine-tuned in the testing process each time a data entry is observed. Moreover,
to satisfy that different time series variables may have different levels of
temporal drift, two adaptive vectors are adopted to provide different weights
for different time series variables. Extensive experiments on four real-world
traffic flow forecasting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
ADCSD method. The code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/ADCSD.

<p>Fine-tuning is the primary methodology for tailoring pre-trained large
language models to specific tasks. As the model's scale and the diversity of
tasks expand, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods are of paramount
importance. One of the most widely used family of methods is low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and its variants. LoRA encodes weight update as the product
of two low-rank matrices. Despite its advantages, LoRA falls short of
full-parameter fine-tuning in terms of generalization error for certain tasks.
</p>
<p>We introduce Chain of LoRA (COLA), an iterative optimization framework
inspired by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, to bridge the gap between LoRA and full
parameter fine-tuning, without incurring additional computational costs or
memory overheads. COLA employs a residual learning procedure where it merges
learned LoRA modules into the pre-trained language model parameters and
re-initilize optimization for new born LoRA modules. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees as well as empirical results to validate the
effectiveness of our algorithm. Across various models (OPT and llama-2) and
seven benchmarking tasks, we demonstrate that COLA can consistently outperform
LoRA without additional computational or memory costs.

<p>Audio and video are two most common modalities in the mainstream media
platforms, e.g., YouTube. To learn from multimodal videos effectively, in this
work, we propose a novel audio-video recognition approach termed audio video
Transformer, AVT, leveraging the effective spatio-temporal representation by
the video Transformer to improve action recognition accuracy. For multimodal
fusion, simply concatenating multimodal tokens in a cross-modal Transformer
requires large computational and memory resources, instead we reduce the
cross-modality complexity through an audio-video bottleneck Transformer. To
improve the learning efficiency of multimodal Transformer, we integrate
self-supervised objectives, i.e., audio-video contrastive learning, audio-video
matching, and masked audio and video learning, into AVT training, which maps
diverse audio and video representations into a common multimodal representation
space. We further propose a masked audio segment loss to learn semantic audio
activities in AVT. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three public
datasets and two in-house datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed AVT. Specifically, AVT outperforms its previous
state-of-the-art counterparts on Kinetics-Sounds by 8%. AVT also surpasses one
of the previous state-of-the-art video Transformers [25] by 10% on VGGSound by
leveraging the audio signal. Compared to one of the previous state-of-the-art
multimodal methods, MBT [32], AVT is 1.3% more efficient in terms of FLOPs and
improves the accuracy by 3.8% on Epic-Kitchens-100.

<p>Interpreting the observations of exoplanet atmospheres to constrain physical
and chemical properties is typically done using Bayesian retrieval techniques.
Because these methods require many model computations, a compromise is made
between model complexity and run time. Reaching this compromise leads to the
simplification of many physical and chemical processes (e.g. parameterised
temperature structure). Here we implement and test sequential neural posterior
estimation (SNPE), a machine learning inference algorithm, for exoplanet
atmospheric retrievals. The goal is to speed up retrievals so they can be run
with more computationally expensive atmospheric models, such as those computing
the temperature structure using radiative transfer. We generate 100 synthetic
observations using ARCiS (ARtful Modeling Code for exoplanet Science, an
atmospheric modelling code with the flexibility to compute models in varying
degrees of complexity) and perform retrievals on them to test the faithfulness
of the SNPE posteriors. The faithfulness quantifies whether the posteriors
contain the ground truth as often as we expect. We also generate a synthetic
observation of a cool brown dwarf using the self-consistent capabilities of
ARCiS and run a retrieval with self-consistent models to showcase the
possibilities that SNPE opens. We find that SNPE provides faithful posteriors
and is therefore a reliable tool for exoplanet atmospheric retrievals. We are
able to run a self-consistent retrieval of a synthetic brown dwarf spectrum
using only 50,000 forward model evaluations. We find that SNPE can speed up
retrievals between $\sim2\times$ and $\geq10\times$ depending on the
computational load of the forward model, the dimensionality of the observation,
and the signal-to-noise ratio of the observation. We make the code publicly
available for the community on Github.

<h1><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04191">Dense Hopfield Networks in the Teacher-Student Setting. (arXiv:2401.04191v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</a></h1>

<p>Dense Hopfield networks are known for their feature to prototype transition
and adversarial robustness. However, previous theoretical studies have been
mostly concerned with their storage capacity. We bridge this gap by studying
the phase diagram of p-body Hopfield networks in the teacher-student setting of
an unsupervised learning problem, uncovering ferromagnetic phases reminiscent
of the prototype and feature learning regimes. On the Nishimori line, we find
the critical size of the training set necessary for efficient pattern
retrieval. Interestingly, we find that that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic
transition of the teacher-student setting coincides with the paramagnetic to
spin-glass transition of the direct model, i.e. with random patterns. Outside
of the Nishimori line, we investigate the learning performance in relation to
the inference temperature and dataset noise. Moreover, we show that using a
larger p for the student than the teacher gives the student an extensive
tolerance to noise. We then derive a closed-form expression measuring the
adversarial robustness of such a student at zero temperature, corroborating the
positive correlation between number of parameters and robustness observed in
large neural networks. We also use our model to clarify why the prototype phase
of modern Hopfield networks is adversarially robust.

<p>The authors of 'Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning in Multiple environments'
propose a method, alpha-MEPOL, to tackle unsupervised RL across multiple
environments. They pre-train a task-agnostic exploration policy using
interactions from an entire environment class and then fine-tune this policy
for various tasks using supervision. We expanded upon this work, with the goal
of improving performance. We primarily propose and experiment with five new
modifications to the original work: sampling trajectories using an
entropy-based probability distribution, dynamic alpha, higher KL Divergence
threshold, curiosity-driven exploration, and alpha-percentile sampling on
curiosity. Dynamic alpha and higher KL-Divergence threshold both provided a
significant improvement over the baseline from the earlier work. PDF-sampling
failed to provide any improvement due to it being approximately equivalent to
the baseline method when the sample space is small. In high-dimensional
environments, the addition of curiosity-driven exploration enhances learning by
encouraging the agent to seek diverse experiences and explore the unknown more.
However, its benefits are limited in low-dimensional and simpler environments
where exploration possibilities are constrained and there is little that is
truly unknown to the agent. Overall, some of our experiments did boost
performance over the baseline and there are a few directions that seem
promising for further research.

<p>With the rapid increase in the number of Anthropogenic Space Objects (ASOs),
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is facing significant congestion, thereby posing
challenges to space operators and risking the viability of the space
environment for varied uses. Current models for examining this evolution, while
detailed, are computationally demanding. To address these issues, we propose a
novel machine learning-based model, as an extension of the MIT Orbital Capacity
Tool (MOCAT). This advanced model is designed to accelerate the propagation of
ASO density distributions, and it is trained on hundreds of simulations
generated by an established and accurate model of the space environment
evolution. We study how different deep learning-based solutions can potentially
be good candidates for ASO propagation and manage the high-dimensionality of
the data. To assess the model's capabilities, we conduct experiments in long
term forecasting scenarios (around 100 years), analyze how and why the
performance degrades over time, and discuss potential solutions to make this
solution better.

<p>We propose a methodology, based on machine learning and optimization, for
selecting a solver configuration for a given instance. First, we employ a set
of solved instances and configurations in order to learn a performance function
of the solver. Secondly, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear program where
the objective/constraints explicitly encode the learnt information, and which
we solve, upon the arrival of an unknown instance, to find the best solver
configuration for that instance, based on the performance function. The main
novelty of our approach lies in the fact that the configuration set search
problem is formulated as a mathematical program, which allows us to a) enforce
hard dependence and compatibility constraints on the configurations, and b)
solve it efficiently with off-the-shelf optimization tools.

<p>The Boltzmann distribution of a protein provides a roadmap to all of its
functional states. Normalizing flows are a promising tool for modeling this
distribution, but current methods are intractable for typical pharmacological
targets; they become computationally intractable due to the size of the system,
heterogeneity of intra-molecular potential energy, and long-range interactions.
To remedy these issues, we present a novel flow architecture that utilizes
split channels and gated attention to efficiently learn the conformational
distribution of proteins defined by internal coordinates. We show that by
utilizing a 2-Wasserstein loss, one can smooth the transition from maximum
likelihood training to energy-based training, enabling the training of
Boltzmann Generators for macromolecules. We evaluate our model and training
strategy on villin headpiece HP35(nle-nle), a 35-residue subdomain, and protein
G, a 56-residue protein. We demonstrate that standard architectures and
training strategies, such as maximum likelihood alone, fail while our novel
architecture and multi-stage training strategy are able to model the
conformational distributions of protein G and HP35.

<p>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has been praised by researchers for its
ability to capture intricate shapes and structures within data. TDA is
considered robust in handling noisy and high-dimensional datasets, and its
interpretability is believed to promote an intuitive understanding of model
behavior. However, claims regarding the power and usefulness of TDA have only
been partially tested in application domains where TDA-based models are
compared to other graph machine learning approaches, such as graph neural
networks. We meticulously test claims on TDA through a comprehensive set of
experiments and validate their merits. Our results affirm TDA's robustness
against outliers and its interpretability, aligning with proponents' arguments.
However, we find that TDA does not significantly enhance the predictive power
of existing methods in our specific experiments, while incurring significant
computational costs. We investigate phenomena related to graph characteristics,
such as small diameters and high clustering coefficients, to mitigate the
computational expenses of TDA computations. Our results offer valuable
perspectives on integrating TDA into graph machine learning tasks.

<p>Despite groundbreaking success in image and text learning, deep learning has
not achieved significant improvements against traditional machine learning (ML)
when it comes to tabular data. This performance gap underscores the need for
data-centric treatment and benchmarking of learning algorithms. Recently,
attention and contrastive learning breakthroughs have shifted computer vision
and natural language processing paradigms. However, the effectiveness of these
advanced deep models on tabular data is sparsely studied using a few data sets
with very large sample sizes, reporting mixed findings after benchmarking
against a limited number of baselines. We argue that the heterogeneity of
tabular data sets and selective baselines in the literature can bias the
benchmarking outcomes. This article extensively evaluates state-of-the-art
attention and contrastive learning methods on a wide selection of 28 tabular
data sets (14 easy and 14 hard-to-classify) against traditional deep and
machine learning. Our data-centric benchmarking demonstrates when traditional
ML is preferred over deep learning and vice versa because no best learning
method exists for all tabular data sets. Combining between-sample and
between-feature attentions conquers the invincible traditional ML on tabular
data sets by a significant margin but fails on high dimensional data, where
contrastive learning takes a robust lead. While a hybrid attention-contrastive
learning strategy mostly wins on hard-to-classify data sets, traditional
methods are frequently superior on easy-to-classify data sets with presumably
simpler decision boundaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
benchmarking paper with statistical analyses of attention and contrastive
learning performances on a diverse selection of tabular data sets against
traditional deep and machine learning baselines to facilitate further advances
in this field.

<p>This study develops a graph search algorithm to find the optimal
discrimination path for the binary classification problem. The objective
function is defined as the difference of variations between the true positive
(TP) and false positive (FP). It uses the depth first search (DFS) algorithm to
find the top-down paths for discrimination. It proposes a dynamic optimization
procedure to optimize TP at the upper levels and then reduce FP at the lower
levels. To accelerate computing speed with improving accuracy, it proposes a
reduced histogram algorithm with variable bin size instead of looping over all
data points, to find the feature threshold of discrimination. The algorithm is
applied on top of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for a binary
classification problem on whether a person is fit or unfit. It significantly
improves TP and reduces FP of the SVM results (e.g., reduced FP by 90% with a
loss of only\ 5% TP). The graph search auto-generates 39 ranked discrimination
paths within 9 seconds on an input of total 328,464 objects, using a dual-core

<p>In this paper, we first extend the result of FL93 and prove universal
consistency for a classification rule based on wide and deep ReLU neural
networks trained on the logistic loss. Unlike the approach in FL93 that
decomposes the estimation and empirical error, we directly analyze the
classification risk based on the observation that a realization of a neural
network that is wide enough is capable of interpolating an arbitrary number of
points. Secondly, we give sufficient conditions for a class of probability
measures under which classifiers based on neural networks achieve minimax
optimal rates of convergence. Our result is motivated from the practitioner's
observation that neural networks are often trained to achieve 0 training error,
which is the case for our proposed neural network classifiers. Our proofs hinge
on recent developments in empirical risk minimization and on approximation
rates of deep ReLU neural networks for various function classes of interest.
Applications to classical function spaces of smoothness illustrate the
usefulness of our result.

<p>Transformer-based models have recently become wildly successful across a
diverse set of domains. At the same time, recent work has shown that
Transformers are inherently low-pass filters that gradually oversmooth the
inputs, reducing the expressivity of their representations. A natural question
is: How can Transformers achieve these successes given this shortcoming? In
this work we show that in fact Transformers are not inherently low-pass
filters. Instead, whether Transformers oversmooth or not depends on the
eigenspectrum of their update equations. Our analysis extends prior work in
oversmoothing and in the closely-related phenomenon of rank collapse. We show
that many successful Transformer models have attention and weights which
satisfy conditions that avoid oversmoothing. Based on this analysis, we derive
a simple way to parameterize the weights of the Transformer update equations
that allows for control over its spectrum, ensuring that oversmoothing does not
occur. Compared to a recent solution for oversmoothing, our approach improves
generalization, even when training with more layers, fewer datapoints, and data
that is corrupted.

<p>At its core, this thesis aims to enhance the practicality of deep learning by
improving the label and training efficiency of deep learning models. To this
end, we investigate data subset selection techniques, specifically active
learning and active sampling, grounded in information-theoretic principles.
Active learning improves label efficiency, while active sampling enhances
training efficiency. Supervised deep learning models often require extensive
training with labeled data. Label acquisition can be expensive and
time-consuming, and training large models is resource-intensive, hindering the
adoption outside academic research and ``big tech.'' Existing methods for data
subset selection in deep learning often rely on heuristics or lack a principled
information-theoretic foundation. In contrast, this thesis examines several
objectives for data subset selection and their applications within deep
learning, striving for a more principled approach inspired by information
theory. We begin by disentangling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in single
forward-pass deep neural networks, which provides helpful intuitions and
insights into different forms of uncertainty and their relevance for data
subset selection. We then propose and investigate various approaches for active
learning and data subset selection in (Bayesian) deep learning. Finally, we
relate various existing and proposed approaches to approximations of
information quantities in weight or prediction space. Underpinning this work is
a principled and practical notation for information-theoretic quantities that
includes both random variables and observed outcomes. This thesis demonstrates
the benefits of working from a unified perspective and highlights the potential
impact of our contributions to the practical application of deep learning.

<p>Private Everlasting Prediction (PEP), recently introduced by Naor et al.
[2023], is a model for differentially private learning in which the learner
never publicly releases a hypothesis. Instead, it provides black-box access to
a "prediction oracle" that can predict the labels of an endless stream of
unlabeled examples drawn from the underlying distribution. Importantly, PEP
provides privacy both for the initial training set and for the endless stream
of classification queries. We present two conceptual modifications to the
definition of PEP, as well as new constructions exhibiting significant
improvements over prior work. Specifically,
</p>
<p>(1) Robustness: PEP only guarantees accuracy provided that all the
classification queries are drawn from the correct underlying distribution. A
few out-of-distribution queries might break the validity of the prediction
oracle for future queries, even for future queries which are sampled from the
correct distribution. We incorporate robustness against such poisoning attacks
into the definition of PEP, and show how to obtain it.
</p>
<p>(2) Dependence of the privacy parameter $\delta$ in the time horizon: We
present a relaxed privacy definition, suitable for PEP, that allows us to
disconnect the privacy parameter $\delta$ from the number of total time steps
$T$. This allows us to obtain algorithms for PEP whose sample complexity is
independent from $T$, thereby making them "truly everlasting". This is in
contrast to prior work where the sample complexity grows with $polylog(T)$.
</p>
<p>(3) New constructions: Prior constructions for PEP exhibit sample complexity
that is quadratic in the VC dimension of the target class. We present new
constructions of PEP for axis-aligned rectangles and for decision-stumps that
exhibit sample complexity linear in the dimension (instead of quadratic). We
show that our constructions satisfy very strong robustness properties.

<p>In this work, we rigorously investigate the robustness of graph neural
fractional-order differential equation (FDE) models. This framework extends
beyond traditional graph neural (integer-order) ordinary differential equation
(ODE) models by implementing the time-fractional Caputo derivative. Utilizing
fractional calculus allows our model to consider long-term memory during the
feature updating process, diverging from the memoryless Markovian updates seen
in traditional graph neural ODE models. The superiority of graph neural FDE
models over graph neural ODE models has been established in environments free
from attacks or perturbations. While traditional graph neural ODE models have
been verified to possess a degree of stability and resilience in the presence
of adversarial attacks in existing literature, the robustness of graph neural
FDE models, especially under adversarial conditions, remains largely
unexplored. This paper undertakes a detailed assessment of the robustness of
graph neural FDE models. We establish a theoretical foundation outlining the
robustness characteristics of graph neural FDE models, highlighting that they
maintain more stringent output perturbation bounds in the face of input and
graph topology disturbances, compared to their integer-order counterparts. Our
empirical evaluations further confirm the enhanced robustness of graph neural
FDE models, highlighting their potential in adversarially robust applications.

the unique challenge of incomplete information propagation on local subgraphs
due to missing cross-subgraph neighbors, previous works resort to the
augmentation of local neighborhoods through the joint FL of missing neighbor
generators and GNNs. Yet their technical designs have profound limitations
regarding the utility, efficiency, and privacy goals of FL. In this work, we
propose FedDEP to comprehensively tackle these challenges in subgraph FL.
FedDEP consists of a series of novel technical designs: (1) Deep neighbor
generation through leveraging the GNN embeddings of potential missing
neighbors; (2) Efficient pseudo-FL for neighbor generation through embedding
prototyping; and (3) Privacy protection through noise-less
edge-local-differential-privacy.
</p>
<p>We analyze the correctness and efficiency of FedDEP, and provide theoretical
guarantees on its privacy.

<p>Recently, a new paradigm, meta learning, has been widely applied to Deep
Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) and significantly improves statistical
performance, especially in cold-start scenarios. However, the existing systems
are not tailored for meta learning based DLRM models and have critical problems
regarding efficiency in distributed training in the GPU cluster. It is because
the conventional deep learning pipeline is not optimized for two task-specific
datasets and two update loops in meta learning. This paper provides a
high-performance framework for large-scale training for Optimization-based Meta
DLRM models over the \textbf{G}PU cluster, namely \textbf{G}-Meta. Firstly,
G-Meta utilizes both data parallelism and model parallelism with careful
orchestration regarding computation and communication efficiency, to enable
high-speed distributed training. Secondly, it proposes a Meta-IO pipeline for
efficient data ingestion to alleviate the I/O bottleneck. Various experimental
results show that G-Meta achieves notable training speed without loss of
statistical performance. Since early 2022, G-Meta has been deployed in Alipay's
core advertising and recommender system, shrinking the continuous delivery of
models by four times. It also obtains 6.48\% improvement in Conversion Rate
(CVR) and 1.06\% increase in CPM (Cost Per Mille) in Alipay's homepage display
advertising, with the benefit of larger training samples and tasks.

<p>Fine-tuning large pretrained models on private datasets may run the risk of
violating privacy. Differential privacy is a framework for mitigating privacy
risks by enforcing algorithmic stability. DP-SGD enables training models with
private data in a privacy-preserving manner, but raises new obstacles in the
form of performance loss and significant engineering challenges. We introduce
DP-ZO, a new method for fine-tuning large language models that preserves the
privacy of training data by privatizing zeroth-order optimization. A key
insight into the design of our method is that the direction of the gradient in
SPSA, the zeroth-order algorithm we use, is always random and the only
information that depends on private data is the step size, i.e., a scalar.
Therefore, we only need to privatize the scalar step size, which is
memory-efficient. DP-ZO, which can be instantiated with either Laplace or
Gaussian noise, provides a strong privacy-utility trade-off across different
tasks, and model sizes, under conservative privacy budgets. One noteworthy
result is that DP-ZO exhibits just $1.86\%$ performance degradation due to
privacy at $(1,10^{-5})$-DP when fine-tuning OPT-66B on 1000 training samples
from SQuAD.

<p>By informing the onset of the degradation process, health status evaluation
serves as a significant preliminary step for reliable remaining useful life
(RUL) estimation of complex equipment. This paper proposes a novel temporal
dynamics learning-based model for detecting change points of individual
devices, even under variable operating conditions, and utilises the learnt
change points to improve the RUL estimation accuracy. During offline model
development, the multivariate sensor data are decomposed to learn fused
temporal correlation features that are generalisable and representative of
normal operation dynamics across multiple operating conditions. Monitoring
statistics and control limit thresholds for normal behaviour are dynamically
constructed from these learnt temporal features for the unsupervised detection
of device-level change points. The detected change points then inform the
degradation data labelling for training a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
RUL estimation model. During online monitoring, the temporal correlation
dynamics of a query device is monitored for breach of the control limit derived
in offline training. If a change point is detected, the device's RUL is
estimated with the well-trained offline model for early preventive action.
Using C-MAPSS turbofan engines as the case study, the proposed method improved
the accuracy by 5.6\% and 7.5\% for two scenarios with six operating
conditions, when compared to existing LSTM-based RUL estimation models that do
not consider heterogeneous change points.

<p>Deepfakes have rapidly emerged as a profound and serious threat to society,
primarily due to their ease of creation and dissemination. This situation has
triggered an accelerated development of deepfake detection technologies.
However, many existing detectors rely heavily on lab-generated datasets for
validation, which may not effectively prepare them for novel, emerging, and
real-world deepfake techniques. In this paper, we conduct an extensive and
comprehensive review and analysis of the latest state-of-the-art deepfake
detectors, evaluating them against several critical criteria. These criteria
facilitate the categorization of these detectors into 4 high-level groups and
13 fine-grained sub-groups, all aligned with a unified standard conceptual
framework. This classification and framework offer deep and practical insights
into the factors that affect detector efficacy. We assess the generalizability
of 16 leading detectors across various standard attack scenarios, including
black-box, white-box, and gray-box settings. Our systematized analysis and
experimentation lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of deepfake
detectors and their generalizability, paving the way for future research
focused on creating detectors adept at countering various attack scenarios.
Additionally, this work offers insights for developing more proactive defenses

<p>The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction and nephrotoxic
drugs, or drugs that adversely affect kidney function, is one that has yet to
be explored in the critical care setting. One contributing factor to this gap
in research is the limited investigation of drug modalities in the intensive
care unit (ICU) context, due to the challenges of processing prescription data
into the corresponding drug representations and a lack in the comprehensive
understanding of these drug representations. This study addresses this gap by
proposing a novel approach that leverages patient prescription data as a
modality to improve existing models for AKI prediction. We base our research on
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, extracting the relevant patient
prescription information and converting it into the selected drug
representation for our research, the extended-connectivity fingerprint (ECFP).
Furthermore, we adopt a unique multimodal approach, developing machine learning
models and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) applied to clinical drug
representations, establishing a procedure which has not been used by any
previous studies predicting AKI. The findings showcase a notable improvement in
AKI prediction through the integration of drug embeddings and other patient
cohort features. By using drug features represented as ECFP molecular
fingerprints along with common cohort features such as demographics and lab
test values, we achieved a considerable improvement in model performance for
the AKI prediction task over the baseline model which does not include the drug
representations as features, indicating that our distinct approach enhances
existing baseline techniques and highlights the relevance of drug data in
predicting AKI in the ICU setting

<p>Air pollution stands as the fourth leading cause of death globally. While
extensive research has been conducted in this domain, most approaches rely on
large datasets when it comes to prediction. This limits their applicability in
low-resource settings though more vulnerable. This study addresses this gap by
proposing a novel machine learning approach for accurate air quality prediction
using two months of air quality data. By leveraging the World Weather
Repository, the meteorological, air pollutant, and Air Quality Index features
from 197 capital cities were considered to predict air quality for the next
day. The evaluation of several machine learning models demonstrates the
effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm in generating reliable
predictions, particularly when applied to classification rather than
regression, approach which enhances the model's generalizability by 42%,
achieving a cross-validation score of 0.38 for regression and 0.89 for
classification. To instill confidence in the predictions, interpretable machine
learning was considered. Finally, a cost estimation comparing the
implementation of this solution in high-resource and low-resource settings is
presented including a tentative of technology licensing business model. This
research highlights the potential for resource-limited countries to
independently predict air quality while awaiting larger datasets to further
refine their predictions.

<p>We consider the problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which
only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. Such
settings have recently drawn considerable interest in the context of generative
modelling. In this paper, we propose a generative model combining diffusion
maps and Langevin dynamics. Diffusion maps are used to approximate the drift
term from the available training samples, which is then implemented in a
discrete-time Langevin sampler to generate new samples. By setting the kernel
bandwidth to match the time step size used in the unadjusted Langevin
algorithm, our method effectively circumvents any stability issues typically
associated with time-stepping stiff stochastic differential equations. More
precisely, we introduce a novel split-step scheme, ensuring that the generated
samples remain within the convex hull of the training samples. Our framework
can be naturally extended to generate conditional samples. We demonstrate the
performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on synthetic datasets
with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization
conditional sampling problem.

<p>Given the complexity and lack of transparency in deep neural networks (DNNs),
extensive efforts have been made to make these systems more interpretable or
explain their behaviors in accessible terms. Unlike most reviews, which focus
on algorithmic and model-centric perspectives, this work takes a "data-centric"
view, examining how data collection, processing, and analysis contribute to
explainable AI (XAI). We categorize existing work into three categories subject
to their purposes: interpretations of deep models, referring to feature
attributions and reasoning processes that correlate data points with model
outputs; influences of training data, examining the impact of training data
nuances, such as data valuation and sample anomalies, on decision-making
processes; and insights of domain knowledge, discovering latent patterns and
fostering new knowledge from data and models to advance social values and
scientific discovery. Specifically, we distill XAI methodologies into data
mining operations on training and testing data across modalities, such as
images, text, and tabular data, as well as on training logs, checkpoints,
models and other DNN behavior descriptors. In this way, our study offers a
comprehensive, data-centric examination of XAI from a lens of data mining

<p>Machine unlearning techniques, which involve retracting data records and
reducing influence of said data on trained models, help with the user privacy
protection objective but incur significant computational costs. Weight
perturbation-based unlearning is a general approach, but it typically involves
globally modifying the parameters. We propose fine-grained Top-K and Random-k
parameters perturbed inexact machine unlearning strategies that address the
privacy needs while keeping the computational costs tractable.
</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the efficacy of our strategies we also tackle the
challenge of evaluating the effectiveness of machine unlearning by considering
the model's generalization performance across both unlearning and remaining
data. To better assess the unlearning effect and model generalization, we
propose novel metrics, namely, the forgetting rate and memory retention rate.
However, for inexact machine unlearning, current metrics are inadequate in
quantifying the degree of forgetting that occurs after unlearning strategies
are applied. To address this, we introduce SPD-GAN, which subtly perturbs the
distribution of data targeted for unlearning. Then, we evaluate the degree of
unlearning by measuring the performance difference of the models on the
perturbed unlearning data before and after the unlearning process. By
implementing these innovative techniques and metrics, we achieve
computationally efficacious privacy protection in machine learning applications
without significant sacrifice of model performance. Furthermore, this approach
provides a novel method for evaluating the degree of unlearning.

<p>Building machines capable of efficiently collaborating with humans has been a
longstanding goal in artificial intelligence. Especially in the presence of
uncertainties, optimal cooperation often requires that humans and artificial
agents model each other's behavior and use these models to infer underlying
goals, beliefs or intentions, potentially involving multiple levels of
recursion. Empirical evidence for such higher-order cognition in human behavior
is also provided by previous works in cognitive science, linguistics, and
robotics. We advocate for a new paradigm for active learning for human feedback
that utilises humans as active data sources while accounting for their higher
levels of agency. In particular, we discuss how increasing level of agency
results in qualitatively different forms of rational communication between an
active learning system and a teacher. Additionally, we provide a practical
example of active learning using a higher-order cognitive model. This is
accompanied by a computational study that underscores the unique behaviors that

<p>Electronic Health Records present a valuable modality for driving
personalized medicine, where treatment is tailored to fit individual-level
differences. For this purpose, many data-driven machine learning and
statistical models rely on the wealth of longitudinal EHRs to study patients'
physiological and treatment effects. However, longitudinal EHRs tend to be
sparse and highly missing, where missingness could also be informative and
reflect the underlying patient's health status. Therefore, the success of
data-driven models for personalized medicine highly depends on how the EHR data
is represented from physiological data, treatments, and the missing values in
the data. To this end, we propose a novel deep-learning model that learns the
underlying patient dynamics over time across multivariate data to generate
personalized realistic values conditioning on an individual's demographic
characteristics and treatments. Our proposed model, IGNITE (Individualized
GeNeration of Imputations in Time-series Electronic health records), utilises a
conditional dual-variational autoencoder augmented with dual-stage attention to
generate missing values for an individual. In IGNITE, we further propose a
novel individualized missingness mask (IMM), which helps our model generate
values based on the individual's observed data and missingness patterns. We
further extend the use of IGNITE from imputing missingness to a personalized
data synthesizer, where it generates missing EHRs that were never observed
prior or even generates new patients for various applications. We validate our
model on three large publicly available datasets and show that IGNITE
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in missing data reconstruction and task
prediction.

<p>Huge embedding tables in modern Deep Learning Recommender Models (DLRM)
require prohibitively large memory during training and inference. Aiming to
reduce the memory footprint of training, this paper proposes FIne-grained
In-Training Embedding Dimension optimization (FIITED). Given the observation
that embedding vectors are not equally important, FIITED adjusts the dimension
of each individual embedding vector continuously during training, assigning
longer dimensions to more important embeddings while adapting to dynamic
changes in data. A novel embedding storage system based on virtually-hashed
physically-indexed hash tables is designed to efficiently implement the
embedding dimension adjustment and effectively enable memory saving.
Experiments on two industry models show that FIITED is able to reduce the size
of embeddings by more than 65% while maintaining the trained model's quality,
saving significantly more memory than a state-of-the-art in-training embedding
pruning method. On public click-through rate prediction datasets, FIITED is
able to prune up to 93.75%-99.75% embeddings without significant accuracy loss.

<p>Domain generalization is a popular machine learning technique that enables
models to perform well on the unseen target domain, by learning from multiple
source domains. Domain generalization is useful in cases where data is limited,
difficult, or expensive to collect, such as in object recognition and
biomedicine. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization algorithm
called "meta-forests", which builds upon the basic random forests model by
incorporating the meta-learning strategy and maximum mean discrepancy measure.
The aim of meta-forests is to enhance the generalization ability of classifiers
by reducing the correlation among trees and increasing their strength. More
specifically, meta-forests conducts meta-learning optimization during each
meta-task, while also utilizing the maximum mean discrepancy as a
regularization term to penalize poor generalization performance in the
meta-test process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we test it
on two publicly object recognition datasets and a glucose monitoring dataset
that we have used in a previous study. Our results show that meta-forests
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization performance

<p>Sea wave monitoring is key in many applications in oceanography such as the
validation of weather and wave models. Conventional in situ solutions are based
on moored buoys whose measurements are often recognized as a standard. However,
being exposed to a harsh environment, they are not reliable, need frequent
maintenance, and the datasets feature many gaps. To overcome the previous
limitations, we propose a system including a buoy, a micro-seismic measuring
station, and a machine learning algorithm. The working principle is based on
measuring the micro-seismic signals generated by the sea waves. Thus, the
machine learning algorithm will be trained to reconstruct the missing buoy data
from the micro-seismic data. As the micro-seismic station can be installed
indoor, it assures high reliability while the machine learning algorithm
provides accurate reconstruction of the missing buoy data. In this work, we
present the methods to process the data, develop and train the machine learning
algorithm, and assess the reconstruction accuracy. As a case of study, we used
experimental data collected in 2014 from the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea
demonstrating that the data reconstruction can be done both for significant
wave height and wave period. The proposed approach was inspired from Data
Science, whose methods were the foundation for the new solutions presented in
this work. For example, estimating the period of the sea waves, often not
discussed in previous works, was relatively simple with machine learning. In
conclusion, the experimental results demonstrated that the new system can
overcome the reliability issues of the buoy keeping the same accuracy.

<p>Massive amounts of unlabelled data are captured by Earth Observation (EO)
satellites, with the Sentinel-2 constellation generating 1.6 TB of data daily.
This makes Remote Sensing a data-rich domain well suited to Machine Learning
(ML) solutions. However, a bottleneck in applying ML models to EO is the lack
of annotated data as annotation is a labour-intensive and costly process. As a
result, research in this domain has focused on Self-Supervised Learning and
Foundation Model approaches. This paper addresses the need to evaluate
different Foundation Models on a fair and uniform benchmark by introducing the
PhilEO Bench, a novel evaluation framework for EO Foundation Models. The
framework comprises of a testbed and a novel 400 GB Sentinel-2 dataset
containing labels for three downstream tasks, building density estimation, road
segmentation, and land cover classification. We present experiments using our
framework evaluating different Foundation Models, including Prithvi and SatMAE,
at multiple n-shots and convergence rates.

<p>Federated Learning (FL) has become an established technique to facilitate
privacy-preserving collaborative training. However, new approaches to FL often
discuss their contributions involving small deep-learning models only. With the
tremendous success of transformer models, the following question arises: What
is necessary to operationalize foundation models in an FL application? Knowing
that computation and communication often take up similar amounts of time in FL,
we introduce a novel taxonomy focused on computational and communication
efficiency methods in FL applications. This said, these methods aim to optimize
the training time and reduce communication between clients and the server. We
also look at the current state of widely used FL frameworks and discuss future
research potentials based on existing approaches in FL research and beyond.

<p>The success of drug discovery and development relies on the precise
prediction of molecular activities and properties. While in silico molecular
property prediction has shown remarkable potential, its use has been limited so
far to assays for which large amounts of data are available. In this study, we
use a fine-tuned large language model to integrate biological assays based on
their textual information, coupled with Barlow Twins, a Siamese neural network
using a novel self-supervised learning approach. This architecture uses both
assay information and molecular fingerprints to extract the true molecular
information. TwinBooster enables the prediction of properties of unseen
bioassays and molecules by providing state-of-the-art zero-shot learning tasks.
Remarkably, our artificial intelligence pipeline shows excellent performance on
the FS-Mol benchmark. This breakthrough demonstrates the application of deep
learning to critical property prediction tasks where data is typically scarce.
By accelerating the early identification of active molecules in drug discovery
and development, this method has the potential to help streamline the

<p>Despite recent advances, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are still
far from perfect. Typical errors include acronyms, named entities and
domain-specific special words for which little or no data is available. To
address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose an self-supervised
continual learning approach. Given the audio of a lecture talk with
corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the
slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from previous work. Then, we
perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new
words into an adaptation dataset. Continual learning is then performed on this
set by adapting low-rank matrix weights added to each weight matrix of the
model. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this
approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur
more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance
of the model.

<p>Survival analysis studies and predicts the time of death, or other singular
unrepeated events, based on historical data, while the true time of death for
some instances is unknown. Survival trees enable the discovery of complex
nonlinear relations in a compact human comprehensible model, by recursively
splitting the population and predicting a distinct survival distribution in
each leaf node. We use dynamic programming to provide the first survival tree
method with optimality guarantees, enabling the assessment of the optimality
gap of heuristics. We improve the scalability of our method through a special

<p>The joint progress of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and domain specific
hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs took over many domains of machine
learning research. This development is accompanied by a rapid growth of the
required computational demands for larger models and more data. Concurrently,
emerging properties of foundation models such as in-context learning drive new
opportunities for machine learning applications. However, the computational
cost of such applications is a limiting factor of the technology in data
centers, and more importantly in mobile devices and edge systems. To mediate
the energy footprint and non-trivial latency of contemporary systems,
neuromorphic computing systems deeply integrate computational principles of
neurobiological systems by leveraging low-power analog and digital
technologies. SpiNNaker2 is a digital neuromorphic chip developed for scalable
machine learning. The event-based and asynchronous design of SpiNNaker2 allows
the composition of large-scale systems involving thousands of chips. This work
features the operating principles of SpiNNaker2 systems, outlining the
prototype of novel machine learning applications. These applications range from
ANNs over bio-inspired spiking neural networks to generalized event-based

<p>The problem of audio-to-audio (A2A) style transfer involves replacing the
style features of the source audio with those from the target audio while
preserving the content related attributes of the source audio. In this paper,
we propose an efficient approach, termed as Zero-shot Emotion Style Transfer
(ZEST), that allows the transfer of emotional content present in the given
source audio with the one embedded in the target audio while retaining the
speaker and speech content from the source. The proposed system builds upon
decomposing speech into semantic tokens, speaker representations and emotion
embeddings. Using these factors, we propose a framework to reconstruct the
pitch contour of the given speech signal and train a decoder that reconstructs
the speech signal. The model is trained using a self-supervision based
reconstruction loss. During conversion, the emotion embedding is alone derived
from the target audio, while rest of the factors are derived from the source
audio. In our experiments, we show that, even without using parallel training
data or labels from the source or target audio, we illustrate zero shot emotion
transfer capabilities of the proposed ZEST model using objective and subjective
quality evaluations.

<p>In code search, the Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework, which
generates exemplar code snippets to augment queries, has emerged as a promising
strategy to address the principal challenge of modality misalignment between
code snippets and natural language queries, particularly with the demonstrated
code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, our
preliminary investigations indicate that the improvements conferred by such an
LLM-augmented framework are somewhat constrained. This limitation could
potentially be ascribed to the fact that the generated codes, albeit
functionally accurate, frequently display a pronounced stylistic deviation from
the ground truth code in the codebase. In this paper, we extend the
foundational GAR framework and propose a simple yet effective method that
additionally Rewrites the Code (ReCo) within the codebase for style
normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCo significantly boosts
retrieval accuracy across sparse (up to 35.7%), zero-shot dense (up to 27.6%),
and fine-tuned dense (up to 23.6%) retrieval settings in diverse search
scenarios. To further elucidate the advantages of ReCo and stimulate research
in code style normalization, we introduce Code Style Similarity, the first
metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarities in code. Notably, our
empirical findings reveal the inadequacy of existing metrics in capturing
stylistic nuances.

<p>We propose SDORE, a semi-supervised deep Sobolev regressor, for the
nonparametric estimation of the underlying regression function and its
gradient. SDORE employs deep neural networks to minimize empirical risk with
gradient norm regularization, allowing computation of the gradient norm on
unlabeled data. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the convergence rates of
SDORE and establish a minimax optimal rate for the regression function.
Crucially, we also derive a convergence rate for the associated plug-in
gradient estimator, even in the presence of significant domain shift. These
theoretical findings offer valuable prior guidance for selecting regularization
parameters and determining the size of the neural network, while showcasing the
provable advantage of leveraging unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning. To
the best of our knowledge, SDORE is the first provable neural network-based

<p>Companies, organizations, and governments increasingly exploit Language
Models' (LM) remarkable capability to display agent-like behavior. As LMs are
adopted to perform tasks with growing autonomy, there exists an urgent need for
reliable and scalable evaluation benchmarks. Current, predominantly static LM
benchmarks are ill-suited to evaluate such dynamic applications. Thus, we
propose jointly evaluating LM performance and alignment through the lenses of
negotiation games. We argue that this common task better reflects real-world
deployment conditions while offering insights into LMs' decision-making
processes. Crucially, negotiation games allow us to study multi-turn, and
cross-model interactions, modulate complexity, and side-step accidental data
leakage in evaluation. We report results for six publicly accessible LMs from
several major providers on a variety of negotiation games, evaluating both
self-play and cross-play performance. Noteworthy findings include: (i)
open-source models are currently unable to complete these tasks; (ii)
cooperative bargaining games prove challenging; and (iii) the most powerful
models do not always "win".

<p>A fundamental problem in machine learning is to understand how neural
networks make accurate predictions, while seemingly bypassing the curse of
dimensionality. A possible explanation is that common training algorithms for
neural networks implicitly perform dimensionality reduction - a process called
feature learning. Recent work posited that the effects of feature learning can
be elicited from a classical statistical estimator called the average gradient
outer product (AGOP). The authors proposed Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) as
an algorithm that explicitly performs feature learning by alternating between
(1) reweighting the feature vectors by the AGOP and (2) learning the prediction
function in the transformed space. In this work, we develop the first
theoretical guarantees for how RFM performs dimensionality reduction by
focusing on the class of overparametrized problems arising in sparse linear
regression and low-rank matrix recovery. Specifically, we show that RFM
restricted to linear models (lin-RFM) generalizes the well-studied Iteratively
Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm. Our results shed light on the
connection between feature learning in neural networks and classical sparse
recovery algorithms. In addition, we provide an implementation of lin-RFM that
scales to matrices with millions of missing entries. Our implementation is
faster than the standard IRLS algorithm as it is SVD-free. It also outperforms
deep linear networks for sparse linear regression and low-rank matrix
completion.

ability and pitch accuracy to enhance the editability of user-provided sound,
we propose HyperGANStrument, which introduces a pitch-invariant hypernetwork to
modulate the weights of a pre-trained GANStrument generator, given a one-shot
sound as input. The hypernetwork modulation provides feedback for the generator
in the reconstruction of the input sound. In addition, we take advantage of an
adversarial fine-tuning scheme for the hypernetwork to improve the

stream handles the continuous tasks, to have a more refined and adaptive
control, while the BC stream handles discrete actions, to ease training. We
evaluate the performance of EVOLUTE in a shooting-and-driving game, where the
agent is required to navigate and continuously identify targets to attack. The
proposed model has higher generalisation capabilities than standard BC
approaches, showing a wider range of behaviours and higher performances. Also,
EVOLUTE is easier to train than a pure end-to-end EBM model, as discrete tasks
can be quite sparse in the dataset and cause model training to explore a much
wider set of possible actions while training.

<p>We introduce MAGNeT, a masked generative sequence modeling method that
operates directly over several streams of audio tokens. Unlike prior work,
MAGNeT is comprised of a single-stage, non-autoregressive transformer. During
training, we predict spans of masked tokens obtained from a masking scheduler,
while during inference we gradually construct the output sequence using several
decoding steps. To further enhance the quality of the generated audio, we
introduce a novel rescoring method in which, we leverage an external
pre-trained model to rescore and rank predictions from MAGNeT, which will be
then used for later decoding steps. Lastly, we explore a hybrid version of
MAGNeT, in which we fuse between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models
to generate the first few seconds in an autoregressive manner while the rest of
the sequence is being decoded in parallel. We demonstrate the efficiency of
MAGNeT for the task of text-to-music and text-to-audio generation and conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation, considering both objective metrics and human
studies. The proposed approach is comparable to the evaluated baselines, while
being significantly faster (x7 faster than the autoregressive baseline).
Through ablation studies and analysis, we shed light on the importance of each
of the components comprising MAGNeT, together with pointing to the trade-offs
between autoregressive and non-autoregressive modeling, considering latency,
throughput, and generation quality. Samples are available on our demo page

<p>Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation tasks
through iterative noise estimation. However, the heavy denoising process and
complex neural networks hinder their low-latency applications in real-world
scenarios. Quantization can effectively reduce model complexity, and
post-training quantization (PTQ), which does not require fine-tuning, is highly
promising in accelerating the denoising process. Unfortunately, we find that
due to the highly dynamic distribution of activations in different denoising
steps, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models suffer from distribution
mismatch issues at both calibration sample level and reconstruction output
level, which makes the performance far from satisfactory, especially in low-bit
cases. In this paper, we propose Enhanced Distribution Alignment for
Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Models (EDA-DM) to address the above
issues. Specifically, at the calibration sample level, we select calibration
samples based on the density and diversity in the latent space, thus
facilitating the alignment of their distribution with the overall samples; and
at the reconstruction output level, we propose Fine-grained Block
Reconstruction, which can align the outputs of the quantized model and the
full-precision model at different network granularity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EDA-DM outperforms the existing post-training quantization
frameworks in both unconditional and conditional generation scenarios. At
low-bit precision, the quantized models with our method even outperform the
full-precision models on most datasets.

<p>Sequences of labeled events observed at irregular intervals in continuous
time are ubiquitous across various fields. Temporal Point Processes (TPPs)
provide a mathematical framework for modeling these sequences, enabling
inferences such as predicting the arrival time of future events and their
associated label, called mark. However, due to model misspecification or lack
of training data, these probabilistic models may provide a poor approximation
of the true, unknown underlying process, with prediction regions extracted from
them being unreliable estimates of the underlying uncertainty. This paper
develops more reliable methods for uncertainty quantification in neural TPP
models via the framework of conformal prediction. A primary objective is to
generate a distribution-free joint prediction region for the arrival time and
mark, with a finite-sample marginal coverage guarantee. A key challenge is to
handle both a strictly positive, continuous response and a categorical
response, without distributional assumptions. We first consider a simple but
overly conservative approach that combines individual prediction regions for
the event arrival time and mark. Then, we introduce a more effective method
based on bivariate highest density regions derived from the joint predictive
density of event arrival time and mark. By leveraging the dependencies between
these two variables, this method exclude unlikely combinations of the two,
resulting in sharper prediction regions while still attaining the pre-specified
coverage level. We also explore the generation of individual univariate
prediction regions for arrival times and marks through conformal regression and
classification techniques. Moreover, we investigate the stronger notion of
conditional coverage. Finally, through extensive experimentation on both
simulated and real-world datasets, we assess the validity and efficiency of
these methods.

<p>The conservation of hydrological resources involves continuously monitoring
their contamination. A multi-agent system composed of autonomous surface
vehicles is proposed in this paper to efficiently monitor the water quality. To
achieve a safe control of the fleet, the fleet policy should be able to act
based on measurements and to the the fleet state. It is proposed to use Local
Gaussian Processes and Deep Reinforcement Learning to jointly obtain effective
monitoring policies. Local Gaussian processes, unlike classical global Gaussian
processes, can accurately model the information in a dissimilar spatial
correlation which captures more accurately the water quality information. A
Deep convolutional policy is proposed, that bases the decisions on the
observation on the mean and variance of this model, by means of an information
gain reward. Using a Double Deep Q-Learning algorithm, agents are trained to
minimize the estimation error in a safe manner thanks to a Consensus-based
heuristic. Simulation results indicate an improvement of up to 24% in terms of
the mean absolute error with the proposed models. Also, training results with
1-3 agents indicate that our proposed approach returns 20% and 24% smaller

<p>Effective prioritization of issue reports is crucial in software engineering
to optimize resource allocation and address critical problems promptly.
However, the manual classification of issue reports for prioritization is
laborious and lacks scalability. Alternatively, many open source software (OSS)
projects employ automated processes for this task, albeit relying on
substantial datasets for adequate training. This research seeks to devise an
automated approach that ensures reliability in issue prioritization, even when
trained on smaller datasets. Our proposed methodology harnesses the power of
Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), recognizing their potential to
efficiently handle this task. By leveraging the capabilities of such models, we
aim to develop a robust system for prioritizing issue reports accurately,
mitigating the necessity for extensive training data while maintaining
reliability. In our research, we have developed a reliable GPT-based approach
to accurately label and prioritize issue reports with a reduced training
dataset. By reducing reliance on massive data requirements and focusing on
few-shot fine-tuning, our methodology offers a more accessible and efficient
solution for issue prioritization in software engineering. Our model predicted
issue types in individual projects up to 93.2% in precision, 95% in recall, and

<p>This paper presents a novel concept learning framework for enhancing model
interpretability and performance in visual classification tasks. Our approach
appends an unsupervised explanation generator to the primary classifier network
and makes use of adversarial training. During training, the explanation module
is optimized to extract visual concepts from the classifier's latent
representations, while the GAN-based module aims to discriminate images
generated from concepts, from true images. This joint training scheme enables
the model to implicitly align its internally learned concepts with
human-interpretable visual properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
the robustness of our approach, while producing coherent concept activations.
We analyse the learned concepts, showing their semantic concordance with object
parts and visual attributes. We also study how perturbations in the adversarial
training protocol impact both classification and concept acquisition. In
summary, this work presents a significant step towards building inherently
interpretable deep vision models with task-aligned concept representations - a
key enabler for developing trustworthy AI for real-world perception tasks.

<p>Modelling of systems where the full system information is unknown is an oft

it's either impossible to consider all the complex physics involved or simpler
models are considered to keep within the limits of the available resources.
Recent advances in greybox modelling like the deep hidden physics models
address this space by combining data and physics. However, for most real-life
applications, model generalizability is a key issue, as retraining a model for
every small change in system inputs and parameters or modification in domain
configuration can render the model economically unviable. In this work we
present a novel enhancement to the idea of hidden physics models which can
generalize for changes in system inputs, parameters and domains. We also show
that this approach holds promise in system discovery as well and helps learn
the hidden physics for the changed system inputs, parameters and domain

<p>As diverse high-performance computing (HPC) systems are built, many
opportunities arise for applications to solve larger problems than ever before.
Given the significantly increased complexity of these HPC systems and
application tuning, empirical performance tuning, such as autotuning, has
emerged as a promising approach in recent years. Despite its effectiveness,
autotuning is often a computationally expensive approach. Transfer learning
(TL)-based autotuning seeks to address this issue by leveraging the data from
prior tuning. Current TL methods for autotuning spend significant time modeling
the relationship between parameter configurations and performance, which is
ineffective for few-shot (that is, few empirical evaluations) tuning on new
tasks. We introduce the first generative TL-based autotuning approach based on
the Gaussian copula (GC) to model the high-performing regions of the search
space from prior data and then generate high-performing configurations for new
tasks. This allows a sampling-based approach that maximizes few-shot
performance and provides the first probabilistic estimation of the few-shot
budget for effective TL-based autotuning. We compare our generative TL approach
with state-of-the-art autotuning techniques on several benchmarks. We find that
the GC is capable of achieving 64.37% of peak few-shot performance in its first
evaluation. Furthermore, the GC model can determine a few-shot transfer budget
that yields up to 33.39$\times$ speedup, a dramatic improvement over the
20.58$\times$ speedup using prior techniques.

at risk. We hereby assess and map at kilometre resolution the conservation
status of the iconic orchid family, and discuss the insights conveyed at
multiple scales. We introduce a new Deep Species Distribution Model trained on
1M occurrences of 14K orchid species to predict their assemblages at global
scale and at kilometre resolution. We propose two main indicators of the
conservation status of the assemblages: (i) the proportion of threatened
species, and (ii) the status of the most threatened species in the assemblage.
We show and analyze the variation of these indicators at World scale and in
relation to currently protected areas in Sumatra island. Global and interactive
maps available online show the indicators of conservation status of orchid
assemblages, with sharp spatial variations at all scales. The highest level of
threat is found at Madagascar and the neighbouring islands. In Sumatra, we
found good correspondence of protected areas with our indicators, but
supplementing current IUCN assessments with status predictions results in
alarming levels of species threat across the island. Recent advances in deep

<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have been the most
popular architectures for biomedical image segmentation, but both of them have
limited ability to handle long-range dependencies because of inherent locality
or computational complexity. To address this challenge, we introduce U-Mamba, a
general-purpose network for biomedical image segmentation. Inspired by the
State Space Sequence Models (SSMs), a new family of deep sequence models known
for their strong capability in handling long sequences, we design a hybrid
CNN-SSM block that integrates the local feature extraction power of
convolutional layers with the abilities of SSMs for capturing the long-range
dependency. Moreover, U-Mamba enjoys a self-configuring mechanism, allowing it
to automatically adapt to various datasets without manual intervention. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse tasks, including the 3D abdominal
organ segmentation in CT and MR images, instrument segmentation in endoscopy
images, and cell segmentation in microscopy images. The results reveal that
U-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based
segmentation networks across all tasks. This opens new avenues for efficient
long-range dependency modeling in biomedical image analysis. The code, models,

<p>The constantly increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) open
new possibilities for human-AI collaboration. One promising approach to
leverage existing complementary capabilities is allowing humans to delegate
individual instances to the AI. However, enabling humans to delegate instances
effectively requires them to assess both their own and the AI's capabilities in
the context of the given task. In this work, we explore the effects of
providing contextual information on human decisions to delegate instances to an
AI. We find that providing participants with contextual information
significantly improves the human-AI team performance. Additionally, we show
that the delegation behavior changes significantly when participants receive
varying types of contextual information. Overall, this research advances the
understanding of human-AI interaction in human delegation and provides
actionable insights for designing more effective collaborative systems.

<p>In this article, we consider convergence of stochastic gradient descent
schemes (SGD), including momentum stochastic gradient descent (MSGD), under
weak assumptions on the underlying landscape. More explicitly, we show that on
the event that the SGD stays bounded we have convergence of the SGD if there is
only a countable number of critical points or if the objective function
satisfies Lojasiewicz-inequalities around all critical levels as all analytic
functions do. In particular, we show that for neural networks with analytic

converges on the event of staying bounded, if the random variables modelling
the signal and response in the training are compactly supported.

<p>Logistic regression training over encrypted data has been an attractive idea
to security concerns for years. In this paper, we propose a faster gradient
variant called $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$ for privacy-preserving logistic
regression training. The core of $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$ can be seen as
an extension of the simplified fixed Hessian.
</p>
<p>We enhance Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) and Adaptive Gradient
Algorithm (Adagrad) respectively with $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$ and
evaluate the enhanced algorithms on several datasets. %gradient $ascent$
methods with this gradient variant on the gene dataset provided by the 2017
iDASH competition and other datasets. Experiments show that the enhanced
methods have a state-of-the-art performance in convergence speed compared to
the raw first-order gradient methods. We then adopt the enhanced NAG method to
implement homomorphic logistic regression training, obtaining a comparable
result by only $3$ iterations.
</p>
<p>There is a promising chance that $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$ could be used
to enhance other first-order gradient methods for general numerical

<p>Random cut forest (RCF) algorithms have been developed for anomaly detection,
particularly in time series data. The RCF algorithm is an improved version of
the isolation forest (IF) algorithm. Unlike the IF algorithm, the RCF algorithm
can determine whether real-time input contains an anomaly by inserting the
input into the constructed tree network. Various RCF algorithms, including
Robust RCF (RRCF), have been developed, where the cutting procedure is
adaptively chosen probabilistically. The RRCF algorithm demonstrates better
performance than the IF algorithm, as dimension cuts are decided based on the
geometric range of the data, whereas the IF algorithm randomly chooses
dimension cuts. However, the overall data structure is not considered in both
IF and RRCF, given that split values are chosen randomly. In this paper, we
propose new IF and RCF algorithms, referred to as the weighted IF (WIF) and
weighted RCF (WRCF) algorithms, respectively. Their split values are determined
by considering the density of the given data. To introduce the WIF and WRCF, we
first present a new geometric measure, a density measure, which is crucial for
constructing the WIF and WRCF. We provide various mathematical properties of
the density measure, accompanied by theorems that support and validate our
claims through numerical examples.

<p>Service robots are integrating more and more into our daily lives to help us
with various tasks. In such environments, robots frequently face new objects
while working in the environment and need to learn them in an open-ended
fashion. Furthermore, such robots must be able to recognize a wide range of
object categories. In this paper, we present a lifelong ensemble learning
approach based on multiple representations to address the few-shot object
recognition problem. In particular, we form ensemble methods based on deep
representations and handcrafted 3D shape descriptors. To facilitate lifelong
learning, each approach is equipped with a memory unit for storing and
retrieving object information instantly. The proposed model is suitable for
open-ended learning scenarios where the number of 3D object categories is not
fixed and can grow over time. We have performed extensive sets of experiments
to assess the performance of the proposed approach in offline, and open-ended
scenarios. For the evaluation purpose, in addition to real object datasets, we
generate a large synthetic household objects dataset consisting of 27000 views
of 90 objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on online few-shot 3D object recognition tasks, as well as its
superior performance over the state-of-the-art open-ended learning approaches.
Furthermore, our results show that while ensemble learning is modestly
beneficial in offline settings, it is significantly beneficial in lifelong
few-shot learning situations. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness
of our approach in both simulated and real-robot settings, where the robot
rapidly learned new categories from limited examples.

<p>We investigate the problem of producing diverse solutions to an image
super-resolution problem. From a probabilistic perspective, this can be done by
sampling from the posterior distribution of an inverse problem, which requires
the definition of a prior distribution on the high-resolution images. In this
work, we propose to use a pretrained hierarchical variational autoencoder
(HVAE) as a prior. We train a lightweight stochastic encoder to encode
low-resolution images in the latent space of a pretrained HVAE. At inference,
we combine the low-resolution encoder and the pretrained generative model to
super-resolve an image. We demonstrate on the task of face super-resolution
that our method provides an advantageous trade-off between the computational
efficiency of conditional normalizing flows techniques and the sample quality
of diffusion based methods.

<p>Artificial Intelligence is now recognized as a general-purpose technology
with ample impact on human life. This work aims at understanding the evolution
of AI and, in particular Machine learning, from the perspective of researchers'
contributions to the field. In order to do so, we present several measures
allowing the analyses of AI and machine learning researchers' impact,
influence, and leadership over the last decades. This work also contributes, to
a certain extent, to shed new light on the history and evolution of AI by
exploring the dynamics involved in the field's evolution by looking at papers
published at the flagship AI and machine learning conferences since the first
International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) held in 1969.
AI development and evolution have led to increasing research output, reflected
in the number of articles published over the last sixty years. We construct
comprehensive citation collaboration and paper-author datasets and compute
corresponding centrality measures to carry out our analyses. These analyses
allow a better understanding of how AI has reached its current state of affairs
in research. Throughout the process, we correlate these datasets with the work
of the ACM Turing Award winners and the so-called two AI winters the field has
gone through. We also look at self-citation trends and new authors' behaviors.
Finally, we present a novel way to infer the country of affiliation of a paper
from its organization. Therefore, this work provides a deep analysis of
Artificial Intelligence history from information gathered and analysed from
large technical venues datasets and suggests novel insights that can contribute

<p>Models for text-to-image synthesis, such as DALL-E~2 and Stable Diffusion,
have recently drawn a lot of interest from academia and the general public.
These models are capable of producing high-quality images that depict a variety
of concepts and styles when conditioned on textual descriptions. However, these
models adopt cultural characteristics associated with specific Unicode scripts
from their vast amount of training data, which may not be immediately apparent.
We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in a textual
description, common models reflect cultural stereotypes and biases in their
generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and
quantitatively, and identify a model's text encoder as the root cause of the
phenomenon. Additionally, malicious users or service providers may try to
intentionally bias the image generation to create racist stereotypes by
replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin
scripts, so-called homoglyphs. To mitigate such unnoticed script attacks, we
propose a novel homoglyph unlearning method to fine-tune a text encoder, making
it robust against homoglyph manipulations.

<p>This work presents a novel reconfigurable architecture for Low Latency Graph
Neural Network (LL-GNN) designs for particle detectors, delivering
unprecedented low latency performance. Incorporating FPGA-based GNNs into
particle detectors presents a unique challenge since it requires
sub-microsecond latency to deploy the networks for online event selection with
a data rate of hundreds of terabytes per second in the Level-1 triggers at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider experiments. This paper proposes a novel
outer-product based matrix multiplication approach, which is enhanced by
exploiting the structured adjacency matrix and a column-major data layout.
Moreover, a fusion step is introduced to further reduce the end-to-end design
latency by eliminating unnecessary boundaries. Furthermore, a GNN-specific
algorithm-hardware co-design approach is presented which not only finds a
design with a much better latency but also finds a high accuracy design under
given latency constraints. To facilitate this, a customizable template for this
low latency GNN hardware architecture has been designed and open-sourced, which
enables the generation of low-latency FPGA designs with efficient resource
utilization using a high-level synthesis tool. Evaluation results show that our
FPGA implementation is up to 9.0 times faster and achieves up to 13.1 times
higher power efficiency than a GPU implementation. Compared to the previous
FPGA implementations, this work achieves 6.51 to 16.7 times lower latency.
Moreover, the latency of our FPGA design is sufficiently low to enable
deployment of GNNs in a sub-microsecond, real-time collider trigger system,
enabling it to benefit from improved accuracy. The proposed LL-GNN design
advances the next generation of trigger systems by enabling sophisticated
algorithms to process experimental data efficiently.

<p>We present a system for anomaly detection in histopathological images. In
histology, normal samples are usually abundant, whereas anomalous
(pathological) cases are scarce or not available. Under such settings,
one-class classifiers trained on healthy data can detect out-of-distribution
anomalous samples. Such approaches combined with pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) representations of images were previously employed for
anomaly detection (AD). However, pre-trained off-the-shelf CNN representations
may not be sensitive to abnormal conditions in tissues, while natural
variations of healthy tissue may result in distant representations. To adapt
representations to relevant details in healthy tissue we propose training a CNN
on an auxiliary task that discriminates healthy tissue of different species,
organs, and staining reagents. Almost no additional labeling workload is
required, since healthy samples come automatically with aforementioned labels.
During training we enforce compact image representations with a center-loss
term, which further improves representations for AD. The proposed system
outperforms established AD methods on a published dataset of liver anomalies.
Moreover, it provided comparable results to conventional methods specifically
tailored for quantification of liver anomalies. We show that our approach can
be used for toxicity assessment of candidate drugs at early development stages
and thereby may reduce expensive late-stage drug attrition.

<p>Temporal graph neural networks have shown promising results in learning
inductive representations by automatically extracting temporal patterns.
However, previous works often rely on complex memory modules or inefficient
random walk methods to construct temporal representations. To address these
limitations, we present an efficient yet effective attention-based encoder that
leverages temporal edge encodings and window-based subgraph sampling to
generate task-agnostic embeddings. Moreover, we propose a joint-embedding
architecture using non-contrastive SSL to learn rich temporal embeddings
without labels. Experimental results on 7 benchmark datasets indicate that on
average, our model outperforms SoTA baselines on the future link prediction
task by 4.23% for the transductive setting and 3.30% for the inductive setting
while only requiring 5-10x less training/inference time. Lastly, different

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to achieve high classification accuracy
on many important real world datasets, but provide no rigorous notion of
predictive uncertainty. Quantifying the confidence of GNN models is difficult
due to the dependence between datapoints induced by the graph structure. We
leverage recent advances in conformal prediction to construct prediction sets
for node classification in inductive learning scenarios. We do this by taking
an existing approach for conformal classification that relies on
\textit{exchangeable} data and modifying it by appropriately weighting the
conformal scores to reflect the network structure. We show through experiments
on standard benchmark datasets using popular GNN models that our approach
provides tighter and better calibrated prediction sets than a naive application

<p>Modern machine learning requires system designers to specify aspects of the
learning pipeline, such as losses, architectures, and optimizers.
Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, instead aims to learn those aspects, and
promises to unlock greater capabilities with less manual effort. One
particularly ambitious goal of meta-learning is to train general-purpose
in-context learning algorithms from scratch, using only black-box models with
minimal inductive bias. Such a model takes in training data, and produces
test-set predictions across a wide range of problems, without any explicit
definition of an inference model, training loss, or optimization algorithm. In
this paper we show that Transformers and other black-box models can be
meta-trained to act as general-purpose in-context learners. We characterize
transitions between algorithms that generalize, algorithms that memorize, and
algorithms that fail to meta-train at all, induced by changes in model size,
number of tasks, and meta-optimization. We further show that the capabilities
of meta-trained algorithms are bottlenecked by the accessible state size
(memory) determining the next prediction, unlike standard models which are
thought to be bottlenecked by parameter count. Finally, we propose practical
interventions such as biasing the training distribution that improve the

<p>Objective: Gaussian Processes (GP)-based filters, which have been effectively
used for various applications including electrocardiogram (ECG) filtering can
be computationally demanding and the choice of their hyperparameters is
typically ad hoc. Methods: We develop a data-driven GP filter to address both
issues, using the notion of the ECG phase domain -- a time-warped
representation of the ECG beats onto a fixed number of samples and aligned
R-peaks, which is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Under this
assumption, the computation of the sample mean and covariance matrix is
simplified, enabling an efficient implementation of the GP filter in a
data-driven manner, with no ad hoc hyperparameters. The proposed filter is
evaluated and compared with a state-of-the-art wavelet-based filter, on the
PhysioNet QT Database. The performance is evaluated by measuring the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of the filter at SNR levels ranging
from -5 to 30dB, in 5dB steps, using additive noise. For a clinical evaluation,
the error between the estimated QT-intervals of the original and filtered
signals is measured and compared with the benchmark filter. Results: It is
shown that the proposed GP filter outperforms the benchmark filter for all the
tested noise levels. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art filter in terms
of QT-interval estimation error bias and variance. Conclusion: The proposed GP
filter is a versatile technique for preprocessing the ECG in clinical and
research applications, is applicable to ECG of arbitrary lengths and sampling
frequencies, and provides confidence intervals for its performance.

<p>The wide popularity of short videos on social media poses new opportunities
and challenges to optimize recommender systems on the video-sharing platforms.
Users sequentially interact with the system and provide complex and
multi-faceted responses, including watch time and various types of interactions
with multiple videos. One the one hand, the platforms aims at optimizing the
users' cumulative watch time (main goal) in long term, which can be effectively
optimized by Reinforcement Learning. On the other hand, the platforms also
needs to satisfy the constraint of accommodating the responses of multiple user
interactions (auxiliary goals) such like, follow, share etc. In this paper, we
formulate the problem of short video recommendation as a Constrained Markov
Decision Process (CMDP). We find that traditional constrained reinforcement
learning algorithms can not work well in this setting. We propose a novel
two-stage constrained actor-critic method: At stage one, we learn individual
policies to optimize each auxiliary signal. At stage two, we learn a policy to
(i) optimize the main signal and (ii) stay close to policies learned at the
first stage, which effectively guarantees the performance of this main policy
on the auxiliaries. Through extensive offline evaluations, we demonstrate
effectiveness of our method over alternatives in both optimizing the main goal
as well as balancing the others. We further show the advantage of our method in
live experiments of short video recommendations, where it significantly
outperforms other baselines in terms of both watch time and interactions. Our
approach has been fully launched in the production system to optimize user
experiences on the platform.

<p>Gaussian processes provide a flexible, non-parametric framework for the
approximation of functions in high-dimensional spaces. The covariance kernel is
the main engine of Gaussian processes, incorporating correlations that underpin
the predictive distribution. For applications with spatiotemporal datasets,
suitable kernels should model joint spatial and temporal dependence. Separable
space-time covariance kernels offer simplicity and computational efficiency.
However, non-separable kernels include space-time interactions that better
capture observed correlations. Most non-separable kernels that admit explicit
expressions are based on mathematical considerations (admissibility conditions)
rather than first-principles derivations. We present a hybrid spectral approach
for generating covariance kernels which is based on physical arguments. We use
this approach to derive a new class of physically motivated, non-separable
covariance kernels which have their roots in the stochastic, linear, damped,
harmonic oscillator (LDHO). The new kernels incorporate functions with both
monotonic and oscillatory decay of space-time correlations. The LDHO covariance
kernels involve space-time interactions which are introduced by dispersion
relations that modulate the oscillator coefficients. We derive explicit
relations for the spatiotemporal covariance kernels in the three oscillator
regimes (underdamping, critical damping, overdamping) and investigate their
properties. We further illustrate the hybrid spectral method by deriving
covariance kernels that are based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.

<p>Safety in goal directed Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings has typically
been handled through constraints over trajectories and have demonstrated good
performance in primarily short horizon tasks. In this paper, we are
specifically interested in the problem of solving temporally extended decision
making problems such as robots cleaning different areas in a house while
avoiding slippery and unsafe areas (e.g., stairs) and retaining enough charge
to move to a charging dock; in the presence of complex safety constraints. Our
key contribution is a (safety) Constrained Search with Hierarchical
Reinforcement Learning (CoSHRL) mechanism that combines an upper level
constrained search agent (which computes a reward maximizing policy from a
given start to a far away goal state while satisfying cost constraints) with a
low-level goal conditioned RL agent (which estimates cost and reward values to
move between nearby states). A major advantage of CoSHRL is that it can handle
constraints on the cost value distribution (e.g., on Conditional Value at Risk,
CVaR) and can adjust to flexible constraint thresholds without retraining. We
perform extensive experiments with different types of safety constraints to
demonstrate the utility of our approach over leading approaches in constrained
and hierarchical RL.

<p>Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions
of machine learning models that are valid with high probability. However,
applying conformal prediction to time series data leads to conservative
prediction regions. In fact, to obtain prediction regions over $T$ time steps
with confidence $1-\delta$, {previous works require that each individual
prediction region is valid} with confidence $1-\delta/T$. We propose an
optimization-based method for reducing this conservatism to enable long horizon
planning and verification when using learning-enabled time series predictors.
Instead of considering prediction errors individually at each time step, we
consider a parameterized prediction error over multiple time steps. By
optimizing the parameters over an additional dataset, we find prediction
regions that are not conservative. We show that this problem can be cast as a
mixed integer linear complementarity program (MILCP), which we then relax into
a linear complementarity program (LCP). Additionally, we prove that the relaxed
LP has the same optimal cost as the original MILCP. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our method on case studies using pedestrian trajectory predictors
and F16 fighter jet altitude predictors.

<p>We study the approximation capacity of some variation spaces corresponding to
shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks. It is shown that sufficiently smooth
functions are contained in these spaces with finite variation norms. For
functions with less smoothness, the approximation rates in terms of the
variation norm are established. Using these results, we are able to prove the
optimal approximation rates in terms of the number of neurons for shallow
ReLU$^k$ neural networks. It is also shown how these results can be used to
derive approximation bounds for deep neural networks and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). As applications, we study convergence rates for nonparametric
regression using three ReLU neural network models: shallow neural network,
over-parameterized neural network, and CNN. In particular, we show that shallow
neural networks can achieve the minimax optimal rates for learning H\"older
functions, which complements recent results for deep neural networks. It is
also proven that over-parameterized (deep or shallow) neural networks can
achieve nearly optimal rates for nonparametric regression.

<p>We propose a novel class incremental learning approach by incorporating a
feature augmentation technique motivated by adversarial attacks. We employ a
classifier learned in the past to complement training examples rather than
simply play a role as a teacher for knowledge distillation towards subsequent
models. The proposed approach has a unique perspective to utilize the previous
knowledge in class incremental learning since it augments features of arbitrary
target classes using examples in other classes via adversarial attacks on a
previously learned classifier. By allowing the cross-class feature
augmentations, each class in the old tasks conveniently populates samples in
the feature space, which alleviates the collapse of the decision boundaries
caused by sample deficiency for the previous tasks, especially when the number
of stored exemplars is small. This idea can be easily incorporated into
existing class incremental learning algorithms without any architecture
modification. Extensive experiments on the standard benchmarks show that our
method consistently outperforms existing class incremental learning methods by
significant margins in various scenarios, especially under an environment with
an extremely limited memory budget.

<p>Real-world data often exhibits bias, imbalance, and privacy risks. Synthetic
datasets have emerged to address these issues. This paradigm relies on
generative AI models to generate unbiased, privacy-preserving data while
maintaining fidelity to the original data. However, assessing the
trustworthiness of synthetic datasets and models is a critical challenge. We
introduce a holistic auditing framework that comprehensively evaluates
synthetic datasets and AI models. It focuses on preventing bias and
discrimination, ensures fidelity to the source data, assesses utility,
robustness, and privacy preservation. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness by auditing various generative models across diverse use cases
like education, healthcare, banking, and human resources, spanning different
data modalities such as tabular, time-series, vision, and natural language.
This holistic assessment is essential for compliance with regulatory
safeguards. We introduce a trustworthiness index to rank synthetic datasets
based on their safeguards trade-offs. Furthermore, we present a
trustworthiness-driven model selection and cross-validation process during
training, exemplified with "TrustFormers" across various data types. This
approach allows for controllable trustworthiness trade-offs in synthetic data
creation. Our auditing framework fosters collaboration among stakeholders,
including data scientists, governance experts, internal reviewers, external
certifiers, and regulators. This transparent reporting should become a standard
practice to prevent bias, discrimination, and privacy violations, ensuring
compliance with policies and providing accountability, safety, and performance
guarantees.

<p>Heterogeneity across devices in federated learning (FL) typically refers to
statistical (e.g., non-i.i.d. data distributions) and resource (e.g.,
communication bandwidth) dimensions. In this paper, we focus on another
important dimension that has received less attention: varying
quantities/distributions of labeled and unlabeled data across devices. In order
to leverage all data, we develop a decentralized federated domain adaptation
methodology which considers the transfer of ML models from devices with high
quality labeled data (called sources) to devices with low quality or unlabeled
data (called targets). Our methodology, Source-Target Determination and Link
Formation (ST-LF), optimizes both (i) classification of devices into sources
and targets and (ii) source-target link formation, in a manner that considers
the trade-off between ML model accuracy and communication energy efficiency. To
obtain a concrete objective function, we derive a measurable generalization
error bound that accounts for estimates of source-target hypothesis deviations
and divergences between data distributions. The resulting optimization problem
is a mixed-integer signomial program, a class of NP-hard problems, for which we
develop an algorithm based on successive convex approximations to solve it
tractably. Subsequent numerical evaluations of ST-LF demonstrate that it
improves classification accuracy and energy efficiency over state-of-the-art
baselines.

<p>Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning mechanism which
still faces two major challenges, namely privacy breaches and system
efficiency. In this work, we reconceptualize the FL system from the perspective
of network information theory, and formulate an original FL communication
framework, FedNC, which is inspired by Network Coding (NC). The main idea of
FedNC is mixing the information of the local models by making random linear
combinations of the original parameters, before uploading for further
aggregation. Due to the benefits of the coding scheme, both theoretical and
experimental analysis indicate that FedNC improves the performance of
traditional FL in several important ways, including security, efficiency, and
robustness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework where NC
is introduced in FL. As FL continues to evolve within practical network
frameworks, more variants can be further designed based on FedNC.

<p>We present a latent variable model for classification that provides a novel
probabilistic interpretation of neural network softmax classifiers. We derive a
variational objective to train the model, analogous to the evidence lower bound
(ELBO) used to train variational auto-encoders, that generalises the softmax
cross-entropy loss. Treating inputs to the softmax layer as samples of a latent
variable, our abstracted perspective reveals a potential inconsistency between
their anticipated distribution, required for accurate label predictions, and
their empirical distribution found in practice. We augment the variational
objective to mitigate such inconsistency and induce a chosen latent
distribution, instead of the implicit assumption found in a standard softmax
layer. Overall, we provide new theoretical insight into the inner workings of
widely-used softmax classifiers. Empirical evaluation on image and text
classification datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach, variational
classification, maintains classification accuracy while the reshaped latent
space improves other desirable properties of a classifier, such as calibration,
adversarial robustness, robustness to distribution shift and sample efficiency
useful in low data settings.

methods to infer compute-optimal model shapes, such as width and depth, and
successfully implement this in vision transformers. Our shape-optimized vision
transformer, SoViT, achieves results competitive with models that exceed twice
its size, despite being pre-trained with an equivalent amount of compute. For
example, SoViT-400m/14 achieves 90.3% fine-tuning accuracy on ILSRCV2012,
surpassing the much larger ViT-g/14 and approaching ViT-G/14 under identical

<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for graph representation
learning in many application domains. The expressiveness of vanilla GNNs is
upper-bounded by 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test as they operate on
rooted subtrees through iterative message passing. In this paper, we empower
GNNs by injecting neighbor-connectivity information extracted from a new type
of substructure. We first investigate different kinds of connectivities
existing in a local neighborhood and identify a substructure called union
subgraph, which is able to capture the complete picture of the 1-hop
neighborhood of an edge. We then design a shortest-path-based substructure
descriptor that possesses three nice properties and can effectively encode the
high-order connectivities in union subgraphs. By infusing the encoded neighbor
connectivities, we propose a novel model, namely Union Subgraph Neural Network
(UnionSNN), which is proven to be strictly more powerful than 1-WL in
distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. Additionally, the local encoding from
union subgraphs can also be injected into arbitrary message-passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and Transformer-based models as a plugin. Extensive
experiments on 18 benchmarks of both graph-level and node-level tasks
demonstrate that UnionSNN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models, with
competitive computational efficiency. The injection of our local encoding to
existing models is able to boost the performance by up to 11.09%. Our code is

<p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in
graph-oriented tasks. However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain
proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of
classical GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue
to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and
homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or
multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of
studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from
inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first
propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more
reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels
of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized
embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph
Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values
and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive

our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance

<p>We present a deep learning-based iterative approach to solve the discrete
heterogeneous Helmholtz equation for high wavenumbers. Combining classical
iterative multigrid solvers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via
preconditioning, we obtain a learned neural solver that is faster and scales
better than a standard multigrid solver. Our approach offers three main
contributions over previous neural methods of this kind. First, we construct a
multilevel U-Net-like encoder-solver CNN with an implicit layer on the coarsest
grid of the U-Net, where convolution kernels are inverted. This alleviates the
field of view problem in CNNs and allows better scalability. Second, we improve
upon the previous CNN preconditioner in terms of the number of parameters,
computation time, and convergence rates. Third, we propose a multiscale
training approach that enables the network to scale to problems of previously
unseen dimensions while still maintaining a reasonable training procedure. Our
encoder-solver architecture can be used to generalize over different slowness
models of various difficulties and is efficient at solving for many right-hand
sides per slowness model. We demonstrate the benefits of our novel architecture
with numerical experiments on a variety of heterogeneous two-dimensional
problems at high wavenumbers.

<p>The Laplace approximation provides a closed-form model selection objective
for neural networks (NN). Online variants, which optimise NN parameters jointly
with hyperparameters, like weight decay strength, have seen renewed interest in
the Bayesian deep learning community. However, these methods violate Laplace's
method's critical assumption that the approximation is performed around a mode
of the loss, calling into question their soundness. This work re-derives online
Laplace methods, showing them to target a variational bound on a mode-corrected
variant of the Laplace evidence which does not make stationarity assumptions.
Online Laplace and its mode-corrected counterpart share stationary points where
1. the NN parameters are a maximum a posteriori, satisfying the Laplace
method's assumption, and 2. the hyperparameters maximise the Laplace evidence,
motivating online methods. We demonstrate that these optima are roughly
attained in practise by online algorithms using full-batch gradient descent on
UCI regression datasets. The optimised hyperparameters prevent overfitting and
outperform validation-based early stopping.

<p>The concept of attention, numerical weights that emphasize the importance of
particular data, has proven to be very relevant in artificial intelligence.
Relative entropy (RE, aka Kullback-Leibler divergence) plays a central role in
communication theory. Here we combine these concepts, attention and RE. RE
guides optimal encoding of messages in bandwidth-limited communication as well
as optimal message decoding via the maximum entropy principle (MEP). In the
coding scenario, RE can be derived from four requirements, namely being
analytical, local, proper, and calibrated. Weighted RE, used for attention
steering in communications, turns out to be improper. To see how proper
attention communication can emerge, we analyze a scenario of a message sender
who wants to ensure that the receiver of the message can perform well-informed
actions. If the receiver decodes the message using the MEP, the sender only
needs to know the receiver's utility function to inform optimally, but not the
receiver's initial knowledge state. In case only the curvature of the utility
function maxima are known, it becomes desirable to accurately communicate an
attention function, in this case a by this curvature weighted and re-normalized
probability function. Entropic attention communication is here proposed as the
desired generalization of entropic communication that permits weighting while
being proper, thereby aiding the design of optimal communication protocols in
technical applications and helping to understand human communication. For
example, our analysis shows how to derive the level of cooperation expected
under misaligned interests of otherwise honest communication partners.

<p>In this paper we give the first efficient algorithms for the $k$-center
problem on dynamic graphs undergoing edge updates. In this problem, the goal is
to partition the input into $k$ sets by choosing $k$ centers such that the
maximum distance from any data point to its closest center is minimized. It is
known that it is NP-hard to get a better than $2$ approximation for this
problem.
</p>
<p>While in many applications the input may naturally be modeled as a graph, all
prior works on $k$-center problem in dynamic settings are on point sets in
arbitrary metric spaces. In this paper, we give a deterministic decremental
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized incremental
$(4+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, both with amortized update time
$kn^{o(1)}$ for weighted graphs. Moreover, we show a reduction that leads to a
fully dynamic $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-center
problem, with worst-case update time that is within a factor $k$ of the
state-of-the-art fully dynamic $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation single-source
shortest paths algorithm in graphs. Matching this bound is a natural goalpost
because the approximate distances of each vertex to its center can be used to
maintain a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation of the graph diameter and the fastest
known algorithms for such a diameter approximation also rely on maintaining
approximate single-source distances.

<p>In vanilla federated learning (FL) such as FedAvg, the parameter server (PS)
and multiple distributed clients can form a typical buyer's market, where the
number of PS/buyers of FL services is far less than the number of
clients/sellers. In order to improve the performance of FL and reduce the cost
of motivating clients to participate in FL, this paper proposes to
differentiate the pricing for services provided by different clients rather
than simply providing the same service pricing for different clients. The price
is differentiated based on the performance improvements brought to FL and their
heterogeneity in computing and communication capabilities. To this end, a
price-discrimination game (PDG) is formulated to comprehensively address the
distributed resource management problems in FL, including multi-objective
trade-off, client selection, and incentive mechanism. As the PDG is a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, a distributed
semi-heuristic algorithm with low computational complexity and low
communication overhead is designed to solve it. The simulation result verifies
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<p>Causal inference in a sub-population involves identifying the causal effect
of an intervention on a specific subgroup, which is distinguished from the
whole population through the influence of systematic biases in the sampling
process. However, ignoring the subtleties introduced by sub-populations can
either lead to erroneous inference or limit the applicability of existing
methods. We introduce and advocate for a causal inference problem in
sub-populations (henceforth called s-ID), in which we merely have access to
observational data of the targeted sub-population (as opposed to the entire
population). Existing inference problems in sub-populations operate on the
premise that the given data distributions originate from the entire population,
thus, cannot tackle the s-ID problem. To address this gap, we provide necessary
and sufficient conditions that must hold in the causal graph for a causal
effect in a sub-population to be identifiable from the observational
distribution of that sub-population. Given these conditions, we present a sound
and complete algorithm for the s-ID problem.

<p>Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CSR) which leverages user sequence
data from multiple domains has received extensive attention in recent years.
However, the existing CSR methods require sharing origin user data across
domains, which violates the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Thus, it
is necessary to combine federated learning (FL) and CSR to fully utilize
knowledge from different domains while preserving data privacy. Nonetheless,
the sequence feature heterogeneity across different domains significantly
impacts the overall performance of FL. In this paper, we propose FedDCSR, a
novel federated cross-domain sequential recommendation framework via
disentangled representation learning. Specifically, to address the sequence
feature heterogeneity across domains, we introduce an approach called
inter-intra domain sequence representation disentanglement (SRD) to disentangle
the user sequence features into domain-shared and domain-exclusive features. In
addition, we design an intra domain contrastive infomax (CIM) strategy to learn
richer domain-exclusive features of users by performing data augmentation on
user sequences. Extensive experiments on three real-world scenarios demonstrate
that FedDCSR achieves significant improvements over existing baselines.

<p>Deep Gradient Leakage (DGL) is a highly effective attack that recovers
private training images from gradient vectors. This attack casts significant
privacy challenges on distributed learning from clients with sensitive data,
where clients are required to share gradients. Defending against such attacks
requires but lacks an understanding of when and how privacy leakage happens,
mostly because of the black-box nature of deep networks. In this paper, we
propose a novel Inversion Influence Function (I$^2$F) that establishes a
closed-form connection between the recovered images and the private gradients
by implicitly solving the DGL problem. Compared to directly solving DGL, I$^2$F
is scalable for analyzing deep networks, requiring only oracle access to
gradients and Jacobian-vector products. We empirically demonstrate that I$^2$F
effectively approximated the DGL generally on different model architectures,
datasets, modalities, attack implementations, and perturbation-based defenses.
With this novel tool, we provide insights into effective gradient perturbation
directions, the unfairness of privacy protection, and privacy-preferred model
initialization. Our codes are provided in

code-switch SVS. To address this gap, we design a shared representation between
Chinese and English singing voices, achieved by using the CMU dictionary with

voice conversion techniques to generate bilingual singing voices while also
exploring the potential use of bilingual speech data. Experiments affirm that
our language-independent representation and incorporation of related datasets

early-stage detection and severity classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR),
a significant risk to the public's health is the primary goal of this work.
This study compares the outcomes of various deep learning models, including

<p>Proteins are macromolecules responsible for essential functions in almost all
living organisms. Designing reasonable proteins with desired functions is
crucial. A protein's sequence and structure are strongly correlated and they
together determine its function. In this paper, we propose NAEPro, a model to
jointly design Protein sequence and structure based on automatically detected
functional sites. NAEPro is powered by an interleaving network of attention and
equivariant layers, which can capture global correlation in a whole sequence
and local influence from nearest amino acids in three dimensional (3D) space.
Such an architecture facilitates effective yet economic message passing at two
levels. We evaluate our model and several strong baselines on two protein
datasets, $\beta$-lactamase and myoglobin. Experimental results show that our
model consistently achieves the highest amino acid recovery rate, TM-score, and
the lowest RMSD among all competitors. These findings prove the capability of
our model to design protein sequences and structures that closely resemble

<p>Modeling the interaction between proteins and ligands and accurately
predicting their binding structures is a critical yet challenging task in drug
discovery. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in
addressing this challenge, with sampling-based and regression-based methods
emerging as two prominent approaches. However, these methods have notable
limitations. Sampling-based methods often suffer from low efficiency due to the
need for generating multiple candidate structures for selection. On the other
hand, regression-based methods offer fast predictions but may experience
decreased accuracy. Additionally, the variation in protein sizes often requires
external modules for selecting suitable binding pockets, further impacting
efficiency. In this work, we propose $\mathbf{FABind}$, an end-to-end model
that combines pocket prediction and docking to achieve accurate and fast
protein-ligand binding. $\mathbf{FABind}$ incorporates a unique ligand-informed
pocket prediction module, which is also leveraged for docking pose estimation.
The model further enhances the docking process by incrementally integrating the
predicted pocket to optimize protein-ligand binding, reducing discrepancies
between training and inference. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, our proposed $\mathbf{FABind}$ demonstrates strong advantages in

<p>We propose a distributional framework for assessing socio-technical risks of
foundation models with quantified statistical significance. Our approach hinges
on a new statistical relative testing based on first and second order
stochastic dominance of real random variables. We show that the second order
statistics in this test are linked to mean-risk models commonly used in
econometrics and mathematical finance to balance risk and utility when choosing
between alternatives. Using this framework, we formally develop a risk-aware
approach for foundation model selection given guardrails quantified by
specified metrics. Inspired by portfolio optimization and selection theory in
mathematical finance, we define a metrics portfolio for each model as a means
to aggregate a collection of metrics, and perform model selection based on the
stochastic dominance of these portfolios. The statistical significance of our
tests is backed theoretically by an asymptotic analysis via central limit
theorems instantiated in practice via a bootstrap variance estimate. We use our
framework to compare various large language models regarding risks related to
drifting from instructions and outputting toxic content.

<p>Perceptual evaluation constitutes a crucial aspect of various
audio-processing tasks. Full reference (FR) or similarity-based metrics rely on
high-quality reference recordings, to which lower-quality or corrupted versions
of the recording may be compared for evaluation. In contrast, no-reference (NR)
metrics evaluate a recording without relying on a reference. Both the FR and NR
approaches exhibit advantages and drawbacks relative to each other. In this
paper, we present a novel framework called CORN that amalgamates these dual
approaches, concurrently training both FR and NR models together. After
training, the models can be applied independently. We evaluate CORN by
predicting several common objective metrics and across two different
architectures. The NR model trained using CORN has access to a reference
recording during training, and thus, as one would expect, it consistently
outperforms baseline NR models trained independently. Perhaps even more
remarkable is that the CORN FR model also outperforms its baseline counterpart,
even though it relies on the same training data and the same model
architecture. Thus, a single training regime produces two independently useful
models, each outperforming independently trained models

<p>The reliance of text classifiers on spurious correlations can lead to poor
generalization at deployment, raising concerns about their use in
safety-critical domains such as healthcare. In this work, we propose to use
counterfactual data augmentation, guided by knowledge of the causal structure
of the data, to simulate interventions on spurious features and to learn more
robust text classifiers. We show that this strategy is appropriate in
prediction problems where the label is spuriously correlated with an attribute.
Under the assumptions of such problems, we discuss the favorable sample
complexity of counterfactual data augmentation, compared to importance
re-weighting. Pragmatically, we match examples using auxiliary data, based on
diff-in-diff methodology, and use a large language model (LLM) to represent a
conditional probability of text. Through extensive experimentation on learning
caregiver-invariant predictors of clinical diagnoses from medical narratives
and on semi-synthetic data, we demonstrate that our method for simulating
interventions improves out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy compared to baseline
invariant learning algorithms.

<p>As neural networks (NN) are deployed across diverse sectors, their energy
demand correspondingly grows. While several prior works have focused on
reducing energy consumption during training, the continuous operation of
ML-powered systems leads to significant energy use during inference. This paper
investigates how the configuration of on-device hardware-elements such as GPU,
memory, and CPU frequency, often neglected in prior studies, affects energy
consumption for NN inference with regular fine-tuning. We propose PolyThrottle,
a solution that optimizes configurations across individual hardware components
using Constrained Bayesian Optimization in an energy-conserving manner. Our
empirical evaluation uncovers novel facets of the energy-performance
equilibrium showing that we can save up to 36 percent of energy for popular
models. We also validate that PolyThrottle can quickly converge towards
near-optimal settings while satisfying application constraints.

<p>Over the past decade, deep learning has proven to be a highly effective tool
for learning meaningful features from raw data. However, it remains an open
question how deep networks perform hierarchical feature learning across layers.
In this work, we attempt to unveil this mystery by investigating the structures
of intermediate features. Motivated by our empirical findings that linear
layers mimic the roles of deep layers in nonlinear networks for feature
learning, we explore how deep linear networks transform input data into output
by investigating the output (i.e., features) of each layer after training in
the context of multi-class classification problems. Toward this goal, we first
define metrics to measure within-class compression and between-class
discrimination of intermediate features, respectively. Through theoretical
analysis of these two metrics, we show that the evolution of features follows a
simple and quantitative pattern from shallow to deep layers when the input data
is nearly orthogonal and the network weights are minimum-norm, balanced, and
approximate low-rank: Each layer of the linear network progressively compresses
within-class features at a geometric rate and discriminates between-class
features at a linear rate with respect to the number of layers that data have
passed through. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative
characterization of feature evolution in hierarchical representations of deep
linear networks. Empirically, our extensive experiments not only validate our
theoretical results numerically but also reveal a similar pattern in deep
nonlinear networks which aligns well with recent empirical studies. Moreover,
we demonstrate the practical implications of our results in transfer learning.

<p>While self-correction has shown promise in improving LLM outputs in terms of
style and quality (e.g. Chen et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023), recent
attempts to self-correct logical or reasoning errors often cause correct
answers to become incorrect, resulting in worse performances overall (Huang et
al., 2023). In this paper, we break down the self-correction process into two
core components: mistake finding and output correction. For mistake finding, we
release BIG-Bench Mistake, a dataset of logical mistakes in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning traces. We provide benchmark numbers for several state-of-the-art
LLMs, and demonstrate that LLMs generally struggle with finding logical
mistakes. For output correction, we propose a backtracking method which
provides large improvements when given information on mistake location. We
construe backtracking as a lightweight alternative to reinforcement learning
methods, and show that it remains effective with a reward model at 60-70%
accuracy.

<p>Interactive segmentation is a crucial research area in medical image analysis
aiming to boost the efficiency of costly annotations by incorporating human
feedback. This feedback takes the form of clicks, scribbles, or masks and
allows for iterative refinement of the model output so as to efficiently guide
the system towards the desired behavior. In recent years, deep learning-based
approaches have propelled results to a new level causing a rapid growth in the
field with 121 methods proposed in the medical imaging domain alone. In this
review, we provide a structured overview of this emerging field featuring a
comprehensive taxonomy, a systematic review of existing methods, and an
in-depth analysis of current practices. Based on these contributions, we
discuss the challenges and opportunities in the field. For instance, we find
that there is a severe lack of comparison across methods which needs to be
tackled by standardized baselines and benchmarks.

<p>The increasing use of Advanced Language Models (ALMs) in diverse sectors,
particularly due to their impressive capability to generate top-tier content
following linguistic instructions, forms the core of this investigation. This
study probes into ALMs' deployment in electronic hardware design, with a
specific emphasis on the synthesis and enhancement of Verilog programming. We
introduce an innovative framework, crafted to assess and amplify ALMs'
productivity in this niche. The methodology commences with the initial crafting
of Verilog programming via ALMs, succeeded by a distinct dual-stage refinement
protocol. The premier stage prioritizes augmenting the code's operational and
linguistic precision, while the latter stage is dedicated to aligning the code
with Power-Performance-Area (PPA) benchmarks, a pivotal component in proficient
hardware design. This bifurcated strategy, merging error remediation with PPA
enhancement, has yielded substantial upgrades in the caliber of ALM-created
Verilog programming. Our framework achieves an 81.37% rate in linguistic
accuracy and 62.0% in operational efficacy in programming synthesis, surpassing
current leading-edge techniques, such as 73% in linguistic accuracy and 46% in
operational efficacy. These findings illuminate ALMs' aptitude in tackling
complex technical domains and signal a positive shift in the mechanization of

<p>The Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm introduced by Robbins and Monro
in 1951 has been a standard method for solving equations of the form
$\mathbf{f}({\boldsymbol {\theta}}) = \mathbf{0}$, when only noisy measurements
of $\mathbf{f}(\cdot)$ are available. If $\mathbf{f}({\boldsymbol {\theta}}) =
\nabla J({\boldsymbol {\theta}})$ for some function $J(\cdot)$, then SA can
also be used to find a stationary point of $J(\cdot)$. At each time $t$, the
current guess ${\boldsymbol {\theta}}_t$ is updated to ${\boldsymbol
{\theta}}_{t+1}$ using a noisy measurement of the form $\mathbf{f}({\boldsymbol
{\theta}}_t) + {\boldsymbol {\xi}}_{t+1}$. In much of the literature, it is
assumed that the error term ${\boldsymbol {\xi}}_{t+1}$ has zero conditional
mean, and/or that its conditional variance is bounded as a function of $t$
(though not necessarily with respect to ${\boldsymbol {\theta}}_t$). Over the
years, SA has been applied to a variety of areas, out of which the focus in
this paper is on convex and nonconvex optimization. As it turns out, in these
applications, the above-mentioned assumptions on the measurement error do not
always hold. In zero-order methods, the error neither has zero mean nor bounded
conditional variance. In the present paper, we extend SA theory to encompass
errors with nonzero conditional mean and/or unbounded conditional variance. In
addition, we derive estimates for the rate of convergence of the algorithm, and
compute the ``optimal step size sequences'' to maximize the estimated rate of
convergence.

<p>Driving Automation Systems (DAS) are subject to complex road environments and
vehicle behaviors and increasingly rely on sophisticated sensors and Artificial
Intelligence (AI). These properties give rise to unique safety faults stemming
from specification insufficiencies and technological performance limitations,
where sensors and AI introduce errors that vary in magnitude and temporal
patterns, posing potential safety risks. The Safety of the Intended
Functionality (SOTIF) standard emerges as a promising framework for addressing
these concerns, focusing on scenario-based analysis to identify hazardous
behaviors and their causes. Although the current standard provides a basic
cause-and-effect model and high-level process guidance, it lacks concepts
required to identify and evaluate hazardous errors, especially within the
context of AI.
</p>
<p>This paper introduces two key contributions to bridge this gap. First, it
defines the SOTIF Temporal Error and Failure Model (STEAM) as a refinement of
the SOTIF cause-and-effect model, offering a comprehensive system-design
perspective. STEAM refines error definitions, introduces error sequences, and
classifies them as error sequence patterns, providing particular relevance to
systems employing advanced sensors and AI. Second, this paper proposes the
Model-based SOTIF Analysis of Failures and Errors (MoSAFE) method, which allows
instantiating STEAM based on system-design models by deriving hazardous error
sequence patterns at module level from hazardous behaviors at vehicle level via
weakest precondition reasoning. Finally, the paper presents a case study
centered on an automated speed-control feature, illustrating the practical
applicability of the refined model and the MoSAFE method in addressing complex
safety challenges in DAS.

<p>Generating time series data is a promising approach to address data
deficiency problems. However, it is also challenging due to the complex
temporal properties of time series data, including local correlations as well
as global dependencies. Most existing generative models have failed to
effectively learn both the local and global properties of time series data. To
address this open problem, we propose a novel time series generative model
named 'Time-Transformer AAE', which consists of an adversarial autoencoder
(AAE) and a newly designed architecture named 'Time-Transformer' within the
decoder. The Time-Transformer first simultaneously learns local and global
features in a layer-wise parallel design, combining the abilities of Temporal
Convolutional Networks and Transformer in extracting local features and global
dependencies respectively. Second, a bidirectional cross attention is proposed
to provide complementary guidance across the two branches and achieve proper
fusion between local and global features. Experimental results demonstrate that
our model can outperform existing state-of-the-art models in 5 out of 6
datasets, specifically on those with data containing both global and local
properties. Furthermore, we highlight our model's advantage on handling this
kind of data via an artificial dataset. Finally, we show our model's ability to
address a real-world problem: data augmentation to support learning with small
datasets and imbalanced datasets.

<p>Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training among
participants while guaranteeing the privacy of raw data. Mainstream FL
methodologies overlook the dynamic nature of real-world data, particularly its
tendency to grow in volume and diversify in classes over time. This oversight
results in FL methods suffering from catastrophic forgetting, where the trained
models inadvertently discard previously learned information upon assimilating
new data. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel Federated
Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) method, named \underline{Fed}erated
\underline{C}lass-Incremental \underline{L}earning with New-Class
\underline{A}ugmented \underline{S}elf-Di\underline{S}tillation (FedCLASS). The
core of FedCLASS is to enrich the class scores of historical models with new
class scores predicted by current models and utilize the combined knowledge for
self-distillation, enabling a more sufficient and precise knowledge transfer
from historical models to current models. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that
FedCLASS stands on reliable foundations, considering scores of old classes
predicted by historical models as conditional probabilities in the absence of
new classes, and the scores of new classes predicted by current models as the
conditional probabilities of class scores derived from historical models.
Empirical experiments demonstrate the superiority of FedCLASS over four

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in
understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication.
However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands
during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge
is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating
frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new
knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many
applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address
deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in
efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end,
recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for
LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains
while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we
first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive
review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and
cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that
classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external
knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.
Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive
empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.
Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can
give a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs.
Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing,
outlining its broad and impactful implications.

<p>As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their
ability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly
crucial. One promising approach is cross-lingual transfer, where a model
acquires specific functionality on some language by finetuning on another
language. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction
tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages. We
first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities
to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only
40 multilingual examples in an English tuning set substantially improve
multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during
tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures
exhibit comparable or superior performance in several languages compared to
monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those
languages. Finally, we find that increasing the number of languages in the
instruction tuning set from 1 to only 2, 3, or 4 increases cross-lingual
generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual
instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual
instruction-responses.

<p>We propose Guided Positive Sampling Self-Supervised Learning (GPS-SSL), a
general method to inject a priori knowledge into Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
positive samples selection. Current SSL methods leverage Data-Augmentations
(DA) for generating positive samples and incorporate prior knowledge - an
incorrect, or too weak DA will drastically reduce the quality of the learned
representation. GPS-SSL proposes instead to design a metric space where
Euclidean distances become a meaningful proxy for semantic relationship. In
that space, it is now possible to generate positive samples from nearest
neighbor sampling. Any prior knowledge can now be embedded into that metric
space independently from the employed DA. From its simplicity, GPS-SSL is
applicable to any SSL method, e.g. SimCLR or BYOL. A key benefit of GPS-SSL is
in reducing the pressure in tailoring strong DAs. For example GPS-SSL reaches
85.58% on Cifar10 with weak DA while the baseline only reaches 37.51%. We
therefore move a step forward towards the goal of making SSL less reliant on
DA. We also show that even when using strong DAs, GPS-SSL outperforms the
baselines on under-studied domains. We evaluate GPS-SSL along with multiple
baseline SSL methods on numerous downstream datasets from different domains
when the models use strong or minimal data augmentations. We hope that GPS-SSL
will open new avenues in studying how to inject a priori knowledge into SSL in
a principled manner.

<p>Surgical tool detection is essential for analyzing and evaluating minimally
invasive surgery videos. Current approaches are mostly based on supervised
methods that require large, fully instance-level labels (i.e., bounding boxes).
However, large image datasets with instance-level labels are often limited
because of the burden of annotation. Thus, surgical tool detection is important
when providing image-level labels instead of instance-level labels since
image-level annotations are considerably more time-efficient than
instance-level annotations. In this work, we propose to strike a balance
between the extremely costly annotation burden and detection performance. We
further propose a co-occurrence loss, which considers a characteristic that
some tool pairs often co-occur together in an image to leverage image-level
labels. Encapsulating the knowledge of co-occurrence using the co-occurrence
loss helps to overcome the difficulty in classification that originates from
the fact that some tools have similar shapes and textures. Extensive
experiments conducted on the Endovis2018 dataset in various data settings show
the effectiveness of our method.

<p>Concepts abound in mathematics and its applications. They vary greatly
between subject areas, and new ones are introduced in each mathematical paper
or application. A formal theory builds a hierarchy of definitions, theorems and
proofs that reference each other. When an AI agent is proving a new theorem,
most of the mathematical concepts and lemmas relevant to that theorem may have
never been seen during training. This is especially true in the Coq proof
assistant, which has a diverse library of Coq projects, each with its own
definitions, lemmas, and even custom tactic procedures used to prove those
lemmas. It is essential for agents to incorporate such new information into
their knowledge base on the fly. We work towards this goal by utilizing a new,
large-scale, graph-based dataset for machine learning in Coq. We leverage a
faithful graph-representation of Coq terms that induces a directed graph of
dependencies between definitions to create a novel graph neural network,
Graph2Tac (G2T), that takes into account not only the current goal, but also
the entire hierarchy of definitions that led to the current goal. G2T is an
online model that is deeply integrated into the users' workflow and can adapt
in real time to new Coq projects and their definitions. It complements well
with other online models that learn in real time from new proof scripts. Our
novel definition embedding task, which is trained to compute representations of
mathematical concepts not seen during training, boosts the performance of the
neural network to rival state-of-the-art k-nearest neighbor predictors.

<p>Diffusion models have shown their effectiveness in generation tasks by
well-approximating the underlying probability distribution. However, diffusion
models are known to suffer from an amplified inherent bias from the training
data in terms of fairness. While the sampling process of diffusion models can
be controlled by conditional guidance, previous works have attempted to find
empirical guidance to achieve quantitative fairness. To address this
limitation, we propose a fairness-aware sampling method called
\textit{attribute switching} mechanism for diffusion models. Without additional
training, the proposed sampling can obfuscate sensitive attributes in generated
data without relying on classifiers. We mathematically prove and experimentally
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two key aspects: (i)
the generation of fair data and (ii) the preservation of the utility of the

<p>Molecular property prediction refers to the task of labeling molecules with
some biochemical properties, playing a pivotal role in the drug discovery and
design process. Recently, with the advancement of machine learning, deep
learning-based molecular property prediction has emerged as a solution to the
resource-intensive nature of traditional methods, garnering significant
attention. Among them, molecular representation learning is the key factor for
molecular property prediction performance. And there are lots of
sequence-based, graph-based, and geometry-based methods that have been
proposed. However, the majority of existing studies focus solely on one
modality for learning molecular representations, failing to comprehensively
capture molecular characteristics and information. In this paper, a novel
multi-modal representation learning model, which integrates the sequence,
graph, and geometry characteristics, is proposed for molecular property
prediction, called SGGRL. Specifically, we design a fusion layer to fusion the
representation of different modalities. Furthermore, to ensure consistency
across modalities, SGGRL is trained to maximize the similarity of
representations for the same molecule while minimizing similarity for different
molecules. To verify the effectiveness of SGGRL, seven molecular datasets, and
several baselines are used for evaluation and comparison. The experimental
results demonstrate that SGGRL consistently outperforms the baselines in most
cases. This further underscores the capability of SGGRL to comprehensively
capture molecular information. Overall, the proposed SGGRL model showcases its
potential to revolutionize molecular property prediction by leveraging
multi-modal representation learning to extract diverse and comprehensive
molecular insights. Our code is released at

<p>Finetuned large language models (such as ChatGPT and Qwen-chat) can generate
Chinese classical poetry following human's instructions. LLMs perform well in
content, but are usually lacking in format, with occasionally excess or
insufficient number of characters in each line. Since most SOTA LLMs are
token-based, we assume that the format inaccuracy is due to the difficulty of
the "token planning" task, which means that the LLM need to know exactly how
much characters are contained in each token and do length-control planning
based on that knowledge. In this paper, we first confirm our assumption by
showing that existing token-based large language models has limited knowledge
on token-character relationship. We use a spelling bee probing procedure, and
find that Qwen-chat failed in nearly 15% Chinese spelling test. We then show
that a token-based model can be easily tailored into a token-free model (in
terms of Chinese), which can largely solve the format accuracy problem. Our
tailoring procedure removes long-tokens from the vocabulary and the language
model head, and keeps only character-level or byte-level tokens. As part of our
contribution, we release the finetuned token-free model (which is based on
Qwen-chat-7B), which can generate chinese classical poetry following complex
instructions like LLMs (such as story paraphrasing), and also perform well in
format. On the test set, our token-free model achives an format accuracy of
0.96, compared to 0.84 for token-based equivalents and 0.38 for GPT-4.

<p>Incorporating neural networks for the solution of Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs) represents a pivotal research direction within computational
mathematics. Within neural network architectures, the integration of the
intrinsic structure of ODEs offers advantages such as enhanced predictive
capabilities and reduced data utilization. Among these structural ODE forms,
the Lagrangian representation stands out due to its significant physical
underpinnings. Building upon this framework, Bhattoo introduced the concept of
Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs). Then in this article, we introduce a
groundbreaking extension (Genralized Lagrangian Neural Networks) to Lagrangian
Neural Networks (LNNs), innovatively tailoring them for non-conservative
systems. By leveraging the foundational importance of the Lagrangian within
Lagrange's equations, we formulate the model based on the generalized
Lagrange's equation. This modification not only enhances prediction accuracy
but also guarantees Lagrangian representation in non-conservative systems.
Furthermore, we perform various experiments, encompassing 1-dimensional and
2-dimensional examples, along with an examination of the impact of network
parameters, which proved the superiority of Generalized Lagrangian Neural

<p>We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference to
constrain the magneto-rotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars.
We first develop a flexible framework to model neutron-star birth properties
and evolution, focusing on their dynamical, rotational and magnetic
characteristics. In particular, we sample initial magnetic-field strengths,
$B$, and spin periods, $P$, from log-normal distributions and capture the
late-time magnetic-field decay with a power law. Each log-normal is described
by a mean, $\mu_{\log B}, \mu_{\log P}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{\log
B}, \sigma_{\log P}$, while the power law is characterized by the index,
$a_{\rm late}$, resulting in five free parameters. We subsequently model the
stars' radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three
radio surveys, and produce a large database of synthetic $P$-$\dot{P}$ diagrams
by varying our input parameters. We then follow a simulation-based inference
approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and employ this database
to train deep neural networks to directly infer the posterior distributions of
the five model parameters. After successfully validating these individual
neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to
infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain
$\mu_{\log B} = 13.10^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\sigma_{\log B} =
0.45^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $\mu_{\log P} = -1.00^{+0.26}_{-0.21}$, $\sigma_{\log
P} = 0.38^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ for the log-normal distributions, and $a_{\rm late}
= -1.80^{+0.65}_{-0.61}$ for the power law at $95\%$ credible interval. Our
approach represents a crucial step towards robust statistical inference for
complex population-synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future

explanation structures that are hard to access, nor directly queryable.We
propose GVEX, a novel paradigm that generates Graph Views for EXplanation. (1)
We design a two-tier explanation structure called explanation views. An
explanation view consists of a set of graph patterns and a set of induced
explanation subgraphs. Given a database G of multiple graphs and a specific
class label l assigned by a GNN-based classifier M, it concisely describes the
fraction of G that best explains why l is assigned by M. (2) We propose quality
measures and formulate an optimization problem to compute optimal explanation
views for GNN explanation. We show that the problem is $\Sigma^2_P$-hard. (3)
We present two algorithms. The first one follows an explain-and-summarize
strategy that first generates high-quality explanation subgraphs which best
explain GNNs in terms of feature influence maximization, and then performs a
summarization step to generate patterns. We show that this strategy provides an
approximation ratio of 1/2. Our second algorithm performs a single-pass to an
input node stream in batches to incrementally maintain explanation views,
having an anytime quality guarantee of 1/4 approximation. Using real-world
benchmark data, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency,
and scalability of GVEX. Through case studies, we showcase the practical
applications of GVEX.

<p>We seek to understand what facilitates sample-efficient learning from
historical datasets for sequential decision-making, a problem that is popularly
known as offline reinforcement learning (RL). Further, we are interested in
algorithms that enjoy sample efficiency while leveraging (value) function
approximation. In this paper, we address these fundamental questions by (i)
proposing a notion of data diversity that subsumes the previous notions of
coverage measures in offline RL and (ii) using this notion to {unify} three
distinct classes of offline RL algorithms based on version spaces (VS),
regularized optimization (RO), and posterior sampling (PS). We establish that
VS-based, RO-based, and PS-based algorithms, under standard assumptions,
achieve \emph{comparable} sample efficiency, which recovers the
state-of-the-art sub-optimality bounds for finite and linear model classes with
the standard assumptions. This result is surprising, given that the prior work
suggested an unfavorable sample complexity of the RO-based algorithm compared
to the VS-based algorithm, whereas posterior sampling is rarely considered in
offline RL due to its explorative nature. Notably, our proposed model-free
PS-based algorithm for offline RL is {novel}, with sub-optimality bounds that
are {frequentist} (i.e., worst-case) in nature.
