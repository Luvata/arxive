<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Chang Yeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Network reliability assessment is pivotal for ensuring the robustness of modern infrastructure systems, from power grids to communication networks. While exact reliability computation for binary-state networks is NP-hard, existing approximation methods face critical tradeoffs between accuracy, scalability, and data efficiency. This study evaluates 20 machine learning methods across three reliability regimes full range (0.0-1.0), high reliability (0.9-1.0), and ultra high reliability (0.99-1.0) to address these gaps. We demonstrate that large-scale networks with arc reliability larger than or equal to 0.9 exhibit near-unity system reliability, enabling computational simplifications. Further, we establish a dataset-scale-driven paradigm for algorithm selection: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) excel with limited data, while Polynomial Regression (PR) achieves superior accuracy in data-rich environments. Our findings reveal ANN's Test-MSE of 7.24E-05 at 30,000 samples and PR's optimal performance (5.61E-05) at 40,000 samples, outperforming traditional Monte Carlo simulations. These insights provide actionable guidelines for balancing accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency in reliability engineering, with implications for infrastructure resilience and system optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15559">Advanced Relay-Based Collaborative Framework for Optimizing Synchronization in Split Federated Learning over Wireless Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Gao, Samuel D. Okegbile, Jun Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) offers a promising approach for distributed model training in edge computing, combining the strengths of split learning in reducing computational demands on edge devices and enhancing data privacy, with the role of federated aggregation to ensure model convergence and synchronization across users. However, synchronization issues caused by user heterogeneity have hindered the development of the framework. To optimize synchronization efficiency among users and improve overall system performance, we propose a collaborative SFL framework (CSFL). Based on the model's partitioning capabilities, we design a mechanism called the collaborative relay optimization mechanism (CROM), where the assistance provided by high-efficiency users is seen as a relay process, with the portion of the model they compute acting as the relay point. Wireless communication between users facilitates real-time collaboration, allowing high-efficiency users to assist bottleneck users in handling part of the model's computation, thereby alleviating the computational load on bottleneck users. Simulation results show that our proposed CSFL framework reduces synchronization delays and improves overall system throughput while maintaining similar performance and convergence rate to the SFL framework. This demonstrates that the collaboration not only reduces synchronization waiting time but also accelerates model convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Yousefpour, Shirin Hosseinmardi, Xiangyu Sun, Ramin Bostanabad</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a simultaneous and meshfree topology optimization (TO) framework based on physics-informed Gaussian processes (GPs). Our framework endows all design and state variables via GP priors which have a shared, multi-output mean function that is parametrized via a customized deep neural network (DNN). The parameters of this mean function are estimated by minimizing a multi-component loss function that depends on the performance metric, design constraints, and the residuals on the state equations. Our TO approach yields well-defined material interfaces and has a built-in continuation nature that promotes global optimality. Other unique features of our approach include (1) its customized DNN which, unlike fully connected feed-forward DNNs, has a localized learning capacity that enables capturing intricate topologies and reducing residuals in high gradient fields, (2) its loss function that leverages localized weights to promote solution accuracy around interfaces, and (3) its use of curriculum training to avoid local optimality.To demonstrate the power of our framework, we validate it against commercial TO package COMSOL on three problems involving dissipated power minimization in Stokes flow.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15563">Dynamic Power Flow Analysis and Fault Characteristics: A Graph Attention Neural Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tan Le, Van Le</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose the joint graph attention neural network (GAT), clustering with adaptive neighbors (CAN) and probabilistic graphical model for dynamic power flow analysis and fault characteristics. In fact, computational efficiency is the main focus to enhance, whilst we ensure the performance accuracy at the accepted level. Note that Machine Learning (ML) based schemes have a requirement of sufficient labeled data during training, which is not easily satisfied in practical applications. Also, there are unknown data due to new arrived measurements or incompatible smart devices in complex smart grid systems. These problems would be resolved by our proposed GAT based framework, which models the label dependency between the network data and learns object representations such that it could achieve the semi-supervised fault diagnosis. To create the joint label dependency, we develop the graph construction from the raw acquired signals by using CAN. Next, we develop the probabilistic graphical model of Markov random field for graph representation, which supports for the GAT based framework. We then evaluate the proposed framework in the use-case application in smart grid and make a fair comparison to the existing methods.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15564">GReaTER: Generate Realistic Tabular data after data Enhancement and Reduction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tung Sum Thomas Kwok, Chi-Hua Wang, Guang Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data synthesis involves not only multi-table synthesis but also generating multi-modal data (e.g., strings and categories), which enables diverse knowledge synthesis. However, separating numerical and categorical data has limited the effectiveness of tabular data generation. The GReaT (Generate Realistic Tabular Data) framework uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode entire rows, eliminating the need to partition data types. Despite this, the framework's performance is constrained by two issues: (1) tabular data entries lack sufficient semantic meaning, limiting LLM's ability to leverage pre-trained knowledge for in-context learning, and (2) complex multi-table datasets struggle to establish effective relationships for collaboration. To address these, we propose GReaTER (Generate Realistic Tabular Data after data Enhancement and Reduction), which includes: (1) a data semantic enhancement system that improves LLM's understanding of tabular data through mapping, enabling better in-context learning, and (2) a cross-table connecting method to establish efficient relationships across complex tables. Experimental results show that GReaTER outperforms the GReaT framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijing Chen, Shoaib Jameel, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Feilong Tang, Usman Naseem, Basem Suleiman, Hakim Hacid, Flora D. Salim, Imran Razzak</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Multi-level Hierarchical Classification (MLHC) classifiers often rely on backbone models with $n$ independent output layers. This structure tends to overlook the hierarchical relationships between classes, leading to inconsistent predictions that violate the underlying taxonomy. Additionally, once a backbone architecture for an MLHC classifier is selected, adapting the model to accommodate new tasks can be challenging. For example, incorporating fairness to protect sensitive attributes within a hierarchical classifier necessitates complex adjustments to maintain the class hierarchy while enforcing fairness constraints. In this paper, we extend this concept to hierarchical classification by introducing a fair, model-agnostic layer designed to enforce taxonomy and optimize specific objectives, including consistency, fairness, and exact match. Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed layer not only improves the fairness of predictions but also enforces the taxonomy, resulting in consistent predictions and superior performance. Compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) employing in-processing de-biasing techniques and models without any bias correction, our approach achieves better outcomes in both fairness and accuracy, making it particularly valuable in sectors like e-commerce, healthcare, and education, where predictive reliability is crucial.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15567">Towards Unified Latent Space for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanchen Luo, Zhiyuan Liu, Yi Zhao, Sihang Li, Kenji Kawaguchi, Tat-Seng Chua, Xiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D molecule generation is crucial for drug discovery and material science, requiring models to process complex multi-modalities, including atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. A key challenge is integrating these modalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D coordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate latent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in both training and sampling. In this work, we propose \textbf{U}nified Variational \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}ncoder for \textbf{3D} Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D molecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining near-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the complexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent diffusion modeling. We demonstrate this by employing the Diffusion Transformer--a general-purpose diffusion model without any molecular inductive bias--for latent generation. Extensive experiments on GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly establishes new benchmarks in both \textit{de novo} and conditional 3D molecule generation, achieving leading efficiency and quality.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15568">Mixed precision accumulation for neural network inference guided by componentwise forward error analysis</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> El-Mehdi El Arar (TARAN), Silviu-Ioan Filip (TARAN), Theo Mary (PEQUAN), Elisa Riccietti (ENS de Lyon)</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a mathematically founded mixed precision accumulation strategy for the inference of neural networks. Our strategy is based on a new componentwise forward error analysis that explains the propagation of errors in the forward pass of neural networks. Specifically, our analysis shows that the error in each component of the output of a layer is proportional to the condition number of the inner product between the weights and the input, multiplied by the condition number of the activation function. These condition numbers can vary widely from one component to the other, thus creating a significant opportunity to introduce mixed precision: each component should be accumulated in a precision inversely proportional to the product of these condition numbers. We propose a practical algorithm that exploits this observation: it first computes all components in low precision, uses this output to estimate the condition numbers, and recomputes in higher precision only the components associated with large condition numbers. We test our algorithm on various networks and datasets and confirm experimentally that it can significantly improve the cost--accuracy tradeoff compared with uniform precision accumulation baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinsheng Yuan, Yun Tang, Weisi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed-precision computing, a widely applied technique in AI, offers a larger trade-off space between accuracy and efficiency. The recent purposed Mixed-Precision Over-the-Air Federated Learning (MP-OTA-FL) enables clients to operate at appropriate precision levels based on their heterogeneous hardware, taking advantages of the larger trade-off space while covering the quantization overheads in the mixed-precision modulation scheme for the OTA aggregation process. A key to further exploring the potential of the MP-OTA-FL framework is the optimization of client precision levels. The choice of precision level hinges on multifaceted factors including hardware capability, potential client contribution, and user satisfaction, among which factors can be difficult to define or quantify.
  In this paper, we propose a RAG-based User Profiling for precision planning framework that integrates retrieval-augmented LLMs and dynamic client profiling to optimize satisfaction and contributions. This includes a hybrid interface for gathering device/user insights and an RAG database storing historical quantization decisions with feedback. Experiments show that our method boosts satisfaction, energy savings, and global model accuracy in MP-OTA-FL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiexia Ye, Weiqi Zhang, Ziyue Li, Jia Li, Fugee Tsung</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical time series (MedTS) classification is crucial for improved diagnosis in healthcare, and yet it is challenging due to the varying granularity of patterns, intricate inter-channel correlation, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While existing transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, they mainly focus on forecasting and fail to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of MedTS data. In this paper, we introduce Sparseformer, a transformer specifically designed for MedTS classification. We propose a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global modeling and token compression, allowing dynamic focus on the most informative tokens while distilling redundant features. This mechanism is then applied to the multi-granularity, cross-channel encoding of medical signals, capturing intra- and inter-granularity correlations and inter-channel connections. The sparsification design allows our model to handle heterogeneous inputs of varying lengths and channels directly. Further, we introduce an adaptive label encoder to address label space misalignment across datasets, equipping our model with cross-dataset transferability to alleviate the medical label scarcity issue. Our model outperforms 12 baselines across seven medical datasets under supervised learning. In the few-shot learning experiments, our model also achieves superior average results. In addition, the in-domain and cross-domain experiments among three diagnostic scenarios demonstrate our model's zero-shot learning capability. Collectively, these findings underscore the robustness and transferability of our model in various medical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingxuan Zhang, Haoran Wang, Jiansheng Li, Yuan Xue, Shikai Guan, Renzhe Xu, Hao Zou, Han Yu, Peng Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 utilize the powerful in-context learning (ICL) capability of Transformer architecture to learn on the fly from limited examples. While ICL underpins many LLM applications, its full potential remains hindered by a limited understanding of its generalization boundaries and vulnerabilities. We present a systematic investigation of transformers' generalization capability with ICL relative to training data coverage by defining a task-centric framework along three dimensions: inter-problem, intra-problem, and intra-task generalization. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, encompassing tasks such as function fitting, API calling, and translation, we find that transformers lack inter-problem generalization with ICL, but excel in intra-task and intra-problem generalization. When the training data includes a greater variety of mixed tasks, it significantly enhances the generalization ability of ICL on unseen tasks and even on known simple tasks. This guides us in designing training data to maximize the diversity of tasks covered and to combine different tasks whenever possible, rather than solely focusing on the target task for testing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songqiao Hu, Zeyi Liu, Xiao He</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensemble learning plays a crucial role in practical applications of online learning due to its enhanced classification performance and adaptable adjustment mechanisms. However, most weight allocation strategies in ensemble learning are heuristic, making it challenging to theoretically guarantee that the ensemble classifier outperforms its base classifiers. To address this issue, a performance-bounded online ensemble learning method based on multi-armed bandits, named PB-OEL, is proposed in this paper. Specifically, multi-armed bandit with expert advice is incorporated into online ensemble learning, aiming to update the weights of base classifiers and make predictions. A theoretical framework is established to bound the performance of the ensemble classifier relative to base classifiers. By setting expert advice of bandits, the bound exceeds the performance of any base classifier when the length of data stream is sufficiently large. Additionally, performance bounds for scenarios with limited annotations are also derived. Numerous experiments on benchmark datasets and a dataset of real-time safety assessment tasks are conducted. The experimental results validate the theoretical bound to a certain extent and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fabian Denoodt, Jos\'e Oramas</p>
<p>Abstract: Since state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods are often computationally demanding, we investigate whether incorporating prior information can improve uncertainty estimates in conventional deep neural networks. Our focus is on machine learning tasks where meaningful predictions can be made from sub-parts of the input. For example, in speaker classification, the speech waveform can be divided into sequential patches, each containing information about the same speaker. We observe that the variance between sub-predictions serves as a reliable proxy for uncertainty in such settings. Our proposed variance-based scaling framework produces competitive uncertainty estimates in classification while being less computationally demanding and allowing for integration as a post-hoc calibration tool. This approach also leads to a simple extension of deep ensembles, improving the expressiveness of their predicted distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua McClellan, Greyson Brothers, Furong Huang, Pratap Tokekar</p>
<p>Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have emerged as a promising approach in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), leveraging symmetry guarantees to greatly improve sample efficiency and generalization. However, real-world environments often exhibit inherent asymmetries arising from factors such as external forces, measurement inaccuracies, or intrinsic system biases. This paper introduces \textit{Partially Equivariant Graph NeUral Networks (PEnGUiN)}, a novel architecture specifically designed to address these challenges. We formally identify and categorize various types of partial equivariance relevant to MARL, including subgroup equivariance, feature-wise equivariance, regional equivariance, and approximate equivariance. We theoretically demonstrate that PEnGUiN is capable of learning both fully equivariant (EGNN) and non-equivariant (GNN) representations within a unified framework. Through extensive experiments on a range of MARL problems incorporating various asymmetries, we empirically validate the efficacy of PEnGUiN. Our results consistently demonstrate that PEnGUiN outperforms both EGNNs and standard GNNs in asymmetric environments, highlighting their potential to improve the robustness and applicability of graph-based MARL algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p>

While a large set of works explored the expressivity of MPNNs, i.e., their ability to separate graphs and approximate functions over them, comparatively less attention has been directed toward investigating their generalization abilities, i.e., making meaningful predictions beyond the training data. Here, we systematically review the existing literature on the generalization abilities of MPNNs. We analyze the strengths and limitations of various studies in these domains, providing insights into their methodologies and findings. Furthermore, we identify potential avenues for future research, aiming to deepen our understanding of the generalization abilities of MPNNs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15693">Good Actions Succeed, Bad Actions Generalize: A Case Study on Why RL Generalizes Better</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Meng Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) are both widely used to train general-purpose agents for complex tasks, yet their generalization capabilities and underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we provide a direct comparison between SL and RL in terms of zero-shot generalization. Using the Habitat visual navigation task as a testbed, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Behavior Cloning (BC) agents across two levels of generalization: state-goal pair generalization within seen environments and generalization to unseen environments. Our experiments show that PPO consistently outperforms BC across both zero-shot settings and performance metrics-success rate and SPL. Interestingly, even though additional optimal training data enables BC to match PPO's zero-shot performance in SPL, it still falls significantly behind in success rate. We attribute this to a fundamental difference in how models trained by these algorithms generalize: BC-trained models generalize by imitating successful trajectories, whereas TD-based RL-trained models generalize through combinatorial experience stitching-leveraging fragments of past trajectories (mostly failed ones) to construct solutions for new tasks. This allows RL to efficiently find solutions in vast state space and discover novel strategies beyond the scope of human knowledge. Besides providing empirical evidence and understanding, we also propose practical guidelines for improving the generalization capabilities of RL and SL through algorithm design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa Jin, Jianhao Ma, Zechun Liu, Andrey Gromov, Aaron Defazio, Lin Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a principled method for quantization-aware training (QAT) of large-scale machine learning models. Specifically, we show that convex, piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) can effectively induce the model parameters to cluster towards discrete values. We minimize PAR-regularized loss functions using an aggregate proximal stochastic gradient method (AProx) and prove that it has last-iterate convergence. Our approach provides an interpretation of the straight-through estimator (STE), a widely used heuristic for QAT, as the asymptotic form of PARQ. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that PARQ obtains competitive performance on convolution- and transformer-based vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Venmugil Elango</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models have emerged as a leading architecture for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation tasks. A fundamental element of the transformer architecture is self-attention, which allows the model to capture intricate dependencies within the data. However, the self-attention mechanism also incurs significant computational and memory costs, particularly for long sequences.
  In this paper, we introduce ATTENTION2D, a novel approach that exploits parallelism along two dimensions - query and key/value - of the self-attention operation. This method enables efficient distribution and parallelization of computations across multiple devices. Our approach facilitates asymptotically faster training and inference phases compared to previous methods, without relying on approximations or incurring additional computational or memory overheads. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques that struggle to scale with an increasing number of processing units, our approach effectively scales with additional processing units.
  Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving communication efficiency and scalability. Compared to Ring Attention, our approach demonstrated up to a 5x performance boost on a GPT-3-like model using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs across 16 nodes, and up to a 9.4x performance boost on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 64 nodes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Sharpe, Rishikesh Ranade, Sanjay Choudhry</p>
<p>Abstract: Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for many industrial applications, but a significant portion of their computational cost stems from the time needed to reach statistical steadiness from initial conditions. We present a novel machine learning-based initialization method that reduces the cost of this subsequent transient solve substantially, achieving a 50% reduction in time-to-convergence compared to traditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Through a case study in automotive aerodynamics using a 16.7M-cell unsteady RANS simulation, we evaluate three ML-based initialization strategies. Two of these strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a physics-informed hybrid method combining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) a more versatile approach integrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD solvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally expensive steady RANS initializations, while requiring only seconds of computation. We develop a robust statistical convergence metric based on windowed time-averaging for performance comparison between initialization strategies. Notably, these improvements are achieved using an ML model trained on a different dataset of automotive geometries, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. The proposed methods integrate seamlessly with existing CFD workflows without requiring modifications to the underlying flow solver, providing a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations through improved ML-based initialization strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joanikij Chulev, Angela Mladenovska</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional data is a critical challenge in machine learning due to the curse of dimensionality and the presence of noise. Traditional clustering algorithms often fail to capture the intrinsic structures in such data. This paper explores a combination of clustering methods, which we called Line Space Clustering (LSC), a representation that transforms data points into lines in a newly defined feature space, enabling clustering based on the similarity of feature value patterns, essentially treating features as sequences. LSC employs a combined distance metric that uses Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances, weighted by a parameter {\alpha}, allowing flexibility in emphasizing shape or magnitude similarities. We delve deeply into the mechanics of DTW and the Savitzky Golay filter, explaining their roles in the algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of LSC on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that randomly experimenting with time-series optimized methods sometimes might surprisingly work on a complex dataset, particularly in noisy environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoxuan Ma, Xishun Liao, Yifan Liu, Qinhua Jiang, Chris Stanford, Shangqing Cao, Jiaqi Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation management, yet existing datasets often lack the resolution and semantic richness required for comprehensive analysis. To address this, we proposed a cross-domain data fusion framework that integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. This framework is demonstrated through two case studies in Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt, where a domain adaptation algorithm ensures its transferability across diverse urban contexts. Quantitative evaluation shows that the generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. Moreover, large-scale traffic simulations for LA County based on the generated synthetic demand align well with observed traffic. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling has significantly improved large language model performance, enabling deeper reasoning to solve complex problems. However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Don\'t Answer Bench (DNA Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNA Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNA Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinlong Zhai, Chunchen Wang, Ruijia Wang, Jiazheng Kang, Shujie Li, Boyu Chen, Tengfei Ma, Zikai Zhou, Cheng Yang, Chuan Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Drug-target interaction prediction (DTI) is essential in various applications including drug discovery and clinical application. There are two perspectives of input data widely used in DTI prediction: Intrinsic data represents how drugs or targets are constructed, and extrinsic data represents how drugs or targets are related to other biological entities. However, any of the two perspectives of input data can be scarce for some drugs or targets, especially for those unpopular or newly discovered. Furthermore, ground-truth labels for specific interaction types can also be scarce. Therefore, we propose the first method to tackle DTI prediction under input data and/or label scarcity. To make our model functional when only one perspective of input data is available, we design two separate experts to process intrinsic and extrinsic data respectively and fuse them adaptively according to different samples. Furthermore, to make the two perspectives complement each other and remedy label scarcity, two experts synergize with each other in a mutually supervised way to exploit the enormous unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets under different extents of input data scarcity and/or label scarcity demonstrate our model outperforms states of the art significantly and steadily, with a maximum improvement of 53.53%. We also test our model without any data scarcity and it still outperforms current methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shibo Jie, Yehui Tang, Kai Han, Yitong Li, Duyu Tang, Zhi-Hong Deng, Yunhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) activates only a subset of experts during inference, allowing the model to maintain low inference FLOPs and latency even as the parameter count scales up. However, since MoE dynamically selects the experts, all the experts need to be loaded into VRAM. Their large parameter size still limits deployment, and offloading, which load experts into VRAM only when needed, significantly increase inference latency. To address this, we propose Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE), a new MoE architecture that is efficient in both communication and VRAM usage. In MoLE, the experts are Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) during training, taking the output of the embedding layer as input. Before inference, these experts can be re-parameterized as lookup tables (LUTs) that retrieves expert outputs based on input ids, and offloaded to storage devices. Therefore, we do not need to perform expert computations during inference. Instead, we directly retrieve the expert's computation results based on input ids and load them into VRAM, and thus the resulting communication overhead is negligible. Experiments show that, with the same FLOPs and VRAM usage, MoLE achieves inference speeds comparable to dense models and significantly faster than MoE with experts offloading, while maintaining performance on par with MoE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu An, Zhibo Hou, Wan Du</p>
<p>Abstract: We study aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimation in a learned regressive system dynamics model. Disentangling aleatoric uncertainty (the inherent randomness of the system) from epistemic uncertainty (the lack of data) is crucial for downstream tasks such as risk-aware control and reinforcement learning, efficient exploration, and robust policy transfer. While existing approaches like Gaussian Processes, Bayesian networks, and model ensembles are widely adopted, they suffer from either high computational complexity or inaccurate uncertainty estimation. To address these limitations, we propose the Compressed Data Representation Model (CDRM), a framework that learns a neural network encoding of the data distribution and enables direct sampling from the output distribution. Our approach incorporates a novel inference procedure based on Langevin dynamics sampling, allowing CDRM to predict arbitrary output distributions rather than being constrained to a Gaussian prior. Theoretical analysis provides the conditions where CDRM achieves better memory and computational complexity compared to bin-based compression methods. Empirical evaluations show that CDRM demonstrates a superior capability to identify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties separately, achieving AUROCs of 0.8876 and 0.9981 on a single test set containing a mixture of both uncertainties. Qualitative results further show that CDRM's capability extends to datasets with multimodal output distributions, a challenging scenario where existing methods consistently fail.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15804">Communication Efficient Federated Learning with Linear Convergence on Heterogeneous Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Liu, Yongqiang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: By letting local clients perform multiple local updates before communicating with a parameter server, modern federated learning algorithms such as FedAvg tackle the communication bottleneck problem in distributed learning and have found many successful applications. However, this asynchrony between local updates and communication also leads to a ''client-drift'' problem when the data is heterogeneous (not independent and identically distributed), resulting in errors in the final learning result. In this paper, we propose a federated learning algorithm, which is called FedCET, to ensure accurate convergence even under heterogeneous distributions of data across clients. Inspired by the distributed optimization algorithm NIDS, we use learning rates to weight information received from local clients to eliminate the ''client-drift''. We prove that under appropriate learning rates, FedCET can ensure linear convergence to the exact solution. Different from existing algorithms which have to share both gradients and a drift-correction term to ensure accurate convergence under heterogeneous data distributions, FedCET only shares one variable, which significantly reduces communication overhead. Numerical comparison with existing counterpart algorithms confirms the effectiveness of FedCET.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Changlong Shi, He Zhao, Bingjie Zhang, Mingyuan Zhou, Dandan Guo, Yi Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training without sharing local data, thereby preserving privacy and enhancing security. However, data heterogeneity resulting from differences across user behaviors, preferences, and device characteristics poses a significant challenge for federated learning. Most previous works overlook the adjustment of aggregation weights, relying solely on dataset size for weight assignment, which often leads to unstable convergence and reduced model performance. Recently, several studies have sought to refine aggregation strategies by incorporating dataset characteristics and model alignment. However, adaptively adjusting aggregation weights while ensuring data security-without requiring additional proxy data-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Federated learning with Adaptive Weight Aggregation (FedAWA), a novel method that adaptively adjusts aggregation weights based on client vectors during the learning process. The client vector captures the direction of model updates, reflecting local data variations, and is used to optimize the aggregation weight without requiring additional datasets or violating privacy. By assigning higher aggregation weights to local models whose updates align closely with the global optimization direction, FedAWA enhances the stability and generalization of the global model. Extensive experiments under diverse scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method, providing a promising solution to the challenges of data heterogeneity in federated learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qishen Zhou, Yifan Zhang, Michail A. Makridis, Anastasios Kouvelas, Yibing Wang, Simon Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Network-wide Traffic State Estimation (TSE), which aims to infer a complete image of network traffic states with sparsely deployed sensors, plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems. With the development of data-driven methods, traffic dynamics modeling has advanced significantly. However, TSE poses fundamental challenges for data-driven approaches, since historical patterns cannot be learned locally at sensor-free segments. Although inductive graph learning shows promise in estimating states at locations without sensor, existing methods typically handle unobserved locations by filling them with zeros, introducing bias to the sensitive graph message propagation. The recently proposed Dirichlet Energy-based Feature Propagation (DEFP) method achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance in unobserved node classification by eliminating the need for zero-filling. However, applying it to TSE faces three key challenges: inability to handle directed traffic networks, strong assumptions in traffic spatial correlation modeling, and overlooks distinct propagation rules of different patterns (e.g., congestion and free flow). We propose DGAE, a novel inductive graph representation model that addresses these challenges through theoretically derived DEFP for Directed graph (DEFP4D), enhanced spatial representation learning via DEFP4D-guided latent space encoding, and physics-guided propagation mechanisms that separately handles congested and free-flow patterns. Experiments on three traffic datasets demonstrate that DGAE outperforms existing SOTA methods and exhibits strong cross-city transferability. Furthermore, DEFP4D can serve as a standalone lightweight solution, showing superior performance under extremely sparse sensor conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashkan Dehghan, Pawe{\l} Pra{\l}at, Fran\c{c}ois Th\'eberge</p>
<p>Abstract: Many real-world and artificial systems and processes can be represented as graphs. Some examples of such systems include social networks, financial transactions, supply chains, and molecular structures. In many of these cases, one needs to consider a collection of graphs, rather than a single network. This could be a collection of distinct but related graphs, such as different protein structures or graphs resulting from dynamic processes on the same network. Examples of the latter include the evolution of social networks, community-induced graphs, or ego-nets around various nodes. A significant challenge commonly encountered is the absence of ground-truth labels for graphs or nodes, necessitating the use of unsupervised techniques to analyze such systems. Moreover, even when ground-truth labels are available, many existing graph machine learning methods depend on complex deep learning models, complicating model explainability and interpretability. To address some of these challenges, we have introduced NEExT (Network Embedding Exploration Tool) for embedding collections of graphs via user-defined node features. The advantages of the framework are twofold: (i) the ability to easily define your own interpretable node-based features in view of the task at hand, and (ii) fast embedding of graphs provided by the Vectorizers library. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of NEExT on collections of synthetic and real-world graphs. For supervised tasks, we demonstrate that performance in graph classification tasks could be achieved similarly to other state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining model interpretability. Furthermore, our framework can also be used to generate high-quality embeddings in an unsupervised way, where target variables are not available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jong-Hyun Jeonga, Hongki Jo, Qiang Zhou, Tahsin Afroz Hoque Nishat, Lang Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become a promising solution for structural health monitoring (SHM), especially in hard-to-reach or remote locations. Battery-powered WSNs offer various advantages over wired systems, however limited battery life has always been one of the biggest obstacles in practical use of the WSNs, regardless of energy harvesting methods. While various methods have been studied for battery health management, existing methods exclusively aim to extend lifetime of individual batteries, lacking a system level view. A consequence of applying such methods is that batteries in a WSN tend to fail at different times, posing significant difficulty on planning and scheduling of battery replacement trip. This study investigate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for active battery degradation management by optimizing duty cycle of WSNs at the system level. This active management strategy effectively reduces earlier failure of battery individuals which enable group replacement without sacrificing WSN performances. A simulated environment based on a real-world WSN setup was developed to train a DRL agent and learn optimal duty cycle strategies. The performance of the strategy was validated in a long-term setup with various network sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Gastric cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and has a high mortality rate. Due to limited medical resources, developing machine learning models for gastric cancer recognition provides an efficient solution for medical institutions. However, such models typically require large sample sizes for training and testing, which can challenge patient privacy. Federated learning offers an effective alternative by enabling model training across multiple institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This paper addresses the limited sample size of publicly available gastric cancer data with a modified data processing method. This paper introduces FedSAF, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to improve the performance of existing methods, particularly in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenarios. FedSAF incorporates attention-based message passing and the Fisher Information Matrix to enhance model accuracy, while a model splitting function reduces computation and transmission costs. Hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this new algorithm, showing improvements in test accuracy on gastric cancer datasets, with FedSAF outperforming existing federated learning methods like FedAMP, FedAvg, and FedProx. The framework's robustness and generalization ability were further validated across additional datasets (SEED, BOT, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10), achieving high performance in diverse environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunan Wang, Jijie Li, Bo-Wen Zhang, Liangdong Wang, Guang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) optimizes language models to align with human preferences. Utilizing on-policy samples, generated directly by the policy model, typically results in better performance due to its distribution consistency with the model compared to off-policy samples. This paper identifies the quality of candidate preference samples as another critical factor. While the quality of on-policy data is inherently constrained by the capabilities of the policy model, off-policy data, which can be derived from diverse sources, offers greater potential for quality despite experiencing distribution shifts. However, current research mostly relies on on-policy data and neglects the value of off-policy data in terms of data quality, due to the challenge posed by distribution shift. In this paper, we propose InCo-DPO, an efficient method for synthesizing preference data by integrating on-policy and off-policy data, allowing dynamic adjustments to balance distribution shifts and data quality, thus finding an optimal trade-off. Consequently, InCo-DPO overcomes the limitations of distribution shifts in off-policy data and the quality constraints of on-policy data. We evaluated InCo-DPO with the Alpaca-Eval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms both on-policy and off-policy data but also achieves a state-of-the-art win rate of 60.8 on Arena-Hard with the vanilla DPO using Gemma-2 model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cynthia Dong, Hong Jia, Young D. Kwon, Georgios Rizos, Cecilia Mascolo</p>
<p>Abstract: While there are many advantages to deploying machine learning models on edge devices, the resource constraints of mobile platforms, the dynamic nature of the environment, and differences between the distribution of training versus in-the-wild data make such deployments challenging. Current test-time adaptation methods are often memory-intensive and not designed to be quantization-compatible or deployed on low-resource devices. To address these challenges, we present LeanTTA, a novel backpropagation-free and stateless framework for quantized test-time adaptation tailored to edge devices. Our approach minimizes computational costs by dynamically updating normalization statistics without backpropagation, which frees LeanTTA from the common pitfall of relying on large batches and historical data, making our method robust to realistic deployment scenarios. Our approach is the first to enable further computational gains by combining partial adaptation with quantized module fusion. We validate our framework across sensor modalities, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art TTA methods, including a 15.7% error reduction, peak memory usage of only 11.2MB for ResNet18, and fast adaptation within an order-of-magnitude of normal inference speeds on-device. LeanTTA provides a robust solution for achieving the right trade offs between accuracy and system efficiency in edge deployments, addressing the unique challenges posed by limited data and varied operational conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoav Wald, Mark Goldstein, Yonathan Efroni, Wouter A. C. van Amsterdam, Rajesh Ranganath</p>
<p>Abstract: Problems in fields such as healthcare, robotics, and finance requires reasoning about the value both of what decision or action to take and when to take it. The prevailing hope is that artificial intelligence will support such decisions by estimating the causal effect of policies such as how to treat patients or how to allocate resources over time. However, existing methods for estimating the effect of a policy struggle with \emph{irregular time}. They either discretize time, or disregard the effect of timing policies. We present a new deep-Q algorithm that estimates the effect of both when and what to do called Earliest Disagreement Q-Evaluation (EDQ). EDQ makes use of recursion for the Q-function that is compatible with flexible sequence models, such as transformers. EDQ provides accurate estimates under standard assumptions. We validate the approach through experiments on survival time and tumor growth tasks.</p>

With recent advances demonstrating transformers' ability to model intricate relationships and outperform in various domains, this work explores their performance on the novel NeuroGraph benchmark datasets and synthetic variants derived from probabilistically removing edges to simulate noisy data. Our findings suggest that graph transformers offer no major advantage over traditional GNNs on this dataset. Furthermore, both traditional and transformer GNN models maintain accuracy even with all edges removed, suggesting that the dataset's graph structures may not significantly impact predictions. We propose further assessing NeuroGraph as a brain connectome benchmark, emphasizing the need for well-curated datasets and improved preprocessing strategies to obtain meaningful edge connections.</p>

<p>Abstract: A fundamental challenge in imitation learning is the \emph{covariate shift} problem. Existing methods to mitigate covariate shift often require additional expert interactions, access to environment dynamics, or complex adversarial training, which may not be practical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method (DeCIL) to mitigate covariate shift by incorporating a denoising mechanism that enhances the contraction properties of the state transition mapping. Our approach involves training two neural networks: a dynamics model ( f ) that predicts the next state from the current state, and a joint state-action denoising policy network ( d ) that refines this state prediction via denoising and outputs the corresponding action. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the denoising network acts as a local contraction mapping, reducing the error propagation of the state transition and improving stability. Our method is straightforward to implement and can be easily integrated with existing imitation learning frameworks without requiring additional expert data or complex modifications to the training procedure. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach effectively improves success rate of various imitation learning tasks under noise perturbation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Wagner, Tobias Nagel, Philipp Leube, Marco F. Huber</p>
<p>Abstract: Correctly setting the parameters of a production machine is essential to improve product quality, increase efficiency, and reduce production costs while also supporting sustainability goals. Identifying optimal parameters involves an iterative process of producing an object and evaluating its quality. Minimizing the number of iterations is, therefore, desirable to reduce the costs associated with unsuccessful attempts. This work introduces a method to optimize the machine parameters in the system itself using a \ac{BO} algorithm. By leveraging existing machine data, we use a transfer learning approach in order to identify an optimum with minimal iterations, resulting in a cost-effective transfer learning algorithm. We validate our approach on a laser machine for cutting sheet metal in the real world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Colombi, Michela Vespa, Nicolas Belletti, Matteo Brina, Simon Dahdal, Filippo Tabanelli, Elena Bellodi, Mauro Tortonesi, Cesare Stefanelli, Massimiliano Vignoli</p>
<p>Abstract: Industry5.0 environments present a critical need for effective anomaly detection methods that can indicate equipment malfunctions, process inefficiencies, or potential safety hazards. The ever-increasing sensorization of manufacturing lines makes processes more observable, but also poses the challenge of continuously analyzing vast amounts of multivariate time series data. These challenges include data quality since data may contain noise, be unlabeled or even mislabeled. A promising approach consists of combining an embedding model with other Machine Learning algorithms to enhance the overall performance in detecting anomalies. Moreover, representing time series as vectors brings many advantages like higher flexibility and improved ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. We tested our solution in a real industrial use case, using data collected from a Bonfiglioli plant. The results demonstrate that, unlike traditional reconstruction-based autoencoders, which often struggle in the presence of sporadic noise, our embedding-based framework maintains high performance across various noise conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alex Barbier-Chebbah (EPIMETHEE), Christian L. Vestergaard (EPIMETHEE), Jean-Baptiste Masson (EPIMETHEE)</p>
<p>Abstract: Information and free-energy maximization are physics principles that provide general rules for an agent to optimize actions in line with specific goals and policies. These principles are the building blocks for designing decision-making policies capable of efficient performance with only partial information. Notably, the information maximization principle has shown remarkable success in the classical bandit problem and has recently been shown to yield optimal algorithms for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian reward distributions. This article explores a broad extension of physics-based approaches to more complex and structured bandit problems. To this end, we cover three distinct types of bandit problems, where information maximization is adapted and leads to strong performance. Since the main challenge of information maximization lies in avoiding over-exploration, we highlight how information is tailored at various levels to mitigate this issue, paving the way for more efficient and robust decision-making strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elisabeth Griesbauer, Claudia Czado, Arnoldo Frigessi, Ingrid Hob{\ae}k Haff</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose TVineSynth, a vine copula based synthetic tabular data generator, which is designed to balance privacy and utility, using the vine tree structure and its truncation to do the trade-off. Contrary to synthetic data generators that achieve DP by globally adding noise, TVineSynth performs a controlled approximation of the estimated data generating distribution, so that it does not suffer from poor utility of the resulting synthetic data for downstream prediction tasks. TVineSynth introduces a targeted bias into the vine copula model that, combined with the specific tree structure of the vine, causes the model to zero out privacy-leaking dependencies while relying on those that are beneficial for utility. Privacy is here measured with membership (MIA) and attribute inference attacks (AIA). Further, we theoretically justify how the construction of TVineSynth ensures AIA privacy under a natural privacy measure for continuous sensitive attributes. When compared to competitor models, with and without DP, on simulated and on real-world data, TVineSynth achieves a superior privacy-utility balance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The fundamental problem of toxicity detection lies in the fact that the term "toxicity" is ill-defined. Such uncertainty causes researchers to rely on subjective and vague data during model training, which leads to non-robust and inaccurate results, following the 'garbage in - garbage out' paradigm.

We propose new definition, metric and training approach as a parts of our framework and demonstrate it's effectiveness using a dataset we collected.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Liu, Yuting Zhang, Feng Liu, Changwang Zhang, Ying Sun, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Language Models have gained significant traction for their ability to process diverse input data types and generate coherent, contextually relevant outputs across various applications. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Despite the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address these limitations, it faces two issues: (1) its generalized capabilities in multimodal tasks remain underexplored. (2) its training constraints such as constant Kullback-Leibler or clamp strategy easily lead to suboptimal bottleneck. To adress these issues, we introduce OThink-MR1, a framework that extends RL to MLLMs, enabling them to achieve deeper understanding and reasoning across multimodal tasks. We design a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy that significantly enhances RL performance, surpassing SFT in same-task evaluations. Also, we are the first to reveal that RL exhibits remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, which shows that models post-trained with RL on one multimodal task can be effectively transfered to another tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the great reasoning ability of our proposed OThink-MR1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdullah Mamun, Diane J. Cook, Hassan Ghasemzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Adherence to prescribed treatments is crucial for individuals with chronic conditions to avoid costly or adverse health outcomes. For certain patient groups, intensive lifestyle interventions are vital for enhancing medication adherence. Accurate forecasting of treatment adherence can open pathways to developing an on-demand intervention tool, enabling timely and personalized support. With the increasing popularity of smartphones and wearables, it is now easier than ever to develop and deploy smart activity monitoring systems. However, effective forecasting systems for treatment adherence based on wearable sensors are still not widely available. We close this gap by proposing Adherence Forecasting and Intervention with Machine Intelligence (AIMI). AIMI is a knowledge-guided adherence forecasting system that leverages smartphone sensors and previous medication history to estimate the likelihood of forgetting to take a prescribed medication. A user study was conducted with 27 participants who took daily medications to manage their cardiovascular diseases. We designed and developed CNN and LSTM-based forecasting models with various combinations of input features and found that LSTM models can forecast medication adherence with an accuracy of 0.932 and an F-1 score of 0.936. Moreover, through a series of ablation studies involving convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures, we demonstrate that leveraging known knowledge about future and personalized training enhances the accuracy of medication adherence forecasting.

<p>Abstract: Wind power producers (WPPs) participating in short-term power markets face significant imbalance costs due to their non-dispatchable and variable production. While some WPPs have a large enough market share to influence prices with their bidding decisions, existing optimal bidding methods rarely account for this aspect. Price-maker approaches typically model bidding as a bilevel optimization problem, but these methods require complex market models, estimating other participants' actions, and are computationally demanding. To address these challenges, we propose an online learning algorithm that leverages contextual information to optimize WPP bids in the price-maker setting. We formulate the strategic bidding problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit, ensuring provable regret minimization. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against various benchmark strategies using a numerical simulation of the German day-ahead and real-time markets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Discriminator Guidance has become a popular method for efficiently refining pre-trained Score-Matching Diffusion models. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the standard implementation of this technique does not necessarily lead to a distribution closer to the real data distribution. Specifically, we show that training the discriminator using Cross-Entropy loss, as commonly done, can in fact increase the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and target distributions, particularly when the discriminator overfits. To address this, we propose a theoretically sound training objective for discriminator guidance that properly minimizes the KL divergence. We analyze its properties and demonstrate empirically across multiple datasets that our proposed method consistently improves over the conventional method by producing samples of higher quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiwoo Son, Zhikai Zhao, Federico Berto, Chuanbo Hua, Changhyun Kwon, Jinkyoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are a class of NP-hard problems ubiquitous in several real-world logistics scenarios that pose significant challenges for optimization. Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical approaches, as it can learn fast heuristics to solve VRPs. However, most research works in NCO for VRPs focus on simplified settings, which do not account for asymmetric distances and travel durations that cannot be derived by simple Euclidean distances and unrealistic data distributions, hindering real-world deployment. This work introduces RRNCO (Real Routing NCO) to bridge the gap of NCO between synthetic and real-world VRPs in the critical aspects of both data and modeling. First, we introduce a new, openly available dataset with real-world data containing a diverse dataset of locations, distances, and duration matrices from 100 cities, considering realistic settings with actual routing distances and durations obtained from Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM). Second, we propose a novel approach that efficiently processes both node and edge features through contextual gating, enabling the construction of more informed node embedding, and we finally incorporate an Adaptation Attention Free Module (AAFM) with neural adaptive bias mechanisms that effectively integrates not only distance matrices but also angular relationships between nodes, allowing our model to capture rich structural information. RRNCO achieves state-of-the-art results in real-world VRPs among NCO methods. We make our dataset and code publicly available at https://github.com/ai4co/real-routing-nco.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16183">Variance-Aware Noisy Training: Hardening DNNs against Unstable Analog Computations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Wang, Hendrik Borras, Bernhard Klein, Holger Fr\"oning</p>
<p>Abstract: The disparity between the computational demands of deep learning and the capabilities of compute hardware is expanding drastically. Although deep learning achieves remarkable performance in countless tasks, its escalating requirements for computational power and energy consumption surpass the sustainable limits of even specialized neural processing units, including the Apple Neural Engine and NVIDIA TensorCores. This challenge is intensified by the slowdown in CMOS scaling.
  Analog computing presents a promising alternative, offering substantial improvements in energy efficiency by directly manipulating physical quantities such as current, voltage, charge, or photons. However, it is inherently vulnerable to manufacturing variations, nonlinearities, and noise, leading to degraded prediction accuracy. One of the most effective techniques for enhancing robustness, Noisy Training, introduces noise during the training phase to reinforce the model against disturbances encountered during inference. Although highly effective, its performance degrades in real-world environments where noise characteristics fluctuate due to external factors such as temperature variations and temporal drift.
  This study underscores the necessity of Noisy Training while revealing its fundamental limitations in the presence of dynamic noise. To address these challenges, we propose Variance-Aware Noisy Training, a novel approach that mitigates performance degradation by incorporating noise schedules which emulate the evolving noise conditions encountered during inference. Our method substantially improves model robustness, without training overhead. We demonstrate a significant increase in robustness, from 72.3\% with conventional Noisy Training to 97.3\% with Variance-Aware Noisy Training on CIFAR-10 and from 38.5\% to 89.9\% on Tiny ImageNet.</p>

<p>Abstract: Laplacian-based methods are popular for dimensionality reduction of data lying in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Several theoretical results for these algorithms depend on the fact that the Euclidean distance approximates the geodesic distance on the underlying submanifold which the data are assumed to lie on. However, for some applications, other metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance, may provide a more appropriate notion of distance than the Euclidean distance. We provide a framework that generalizes the problem of manifold learning to metric spaces and study when a metric satisfies sufficient conditions for the pointwise convergence of the graph Laplacian.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuki Akiyama, Konstantinos Slavakis</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces novel Bellman mappings (B-Maps) for value iteration (VI) in distributed reinforcement learning (DRL), where multiple agents operate over a network without a centralized fusion node. Each agent constructs its own nonparametric B-Map for VI while communicating only with direct neighbors to achieve consensus. These B-Maps operate on Q-functions represented in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling a nonparametric formulation that allows for flexible, agent-specific basis function design. Unlike existing DRL methods that restrict information exchange to Q-function estimates, the proposed framework also enables agents to share basis information in the form of covariance matrices, capturing additional structural details. A theoretical analysis establishes linear convergence rates for both Q-function and covariance-matrix estimates toward their consensus values. The optimal learning rates for consensus-based updates are dictated by the ratio of the smallest positive eigenvalue to the largest one of the network's Laplacian matrix. Furthermore, each nodal Q-function estimate is shown to lie very close to the fixed point of a centralized nonparametric B-Map, effectively allowing the proposed DRL design to approximate the performance of a centralized fusion center. Numerical experiments on two well-known control problems demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed nonparametric B-Maps compared to prior methods. Notably, the results reveal a counter-intuitive finding: although the proposed approach involves greater information exchange -- specifically through the sharing of covariance matrices -- it achieves the desired performance with lower cumulative communication cost than existing DRL schemes, highlighting the crucial role of basis information in accelerating the learning process.</p>

<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are machine learning models that improve interpretability by grounding their predictions on human-understandable concepts, allowing for targeted interventions in their decision-making process. However, when intervened on, CBMs assume the availability of humans that can identify the need to intervene and always provide correct interventions. Both assumptions are unrealistic and impractical, considering labor costs and human error-proneness. In contrast, Learning to Defer (L2D) extends supervised learning by allowing machine learning models to identify cases where a human is more likely to be correct than the model, thus leading to deferring systems with improved performance. In this work, we gain inspiration from L2D and propose Deferring CBMs (DCBMs), a novel framework that allows CBMs to learn when an intervention is needed. To this end, we model DCBMs as a composition of deferring systems and derive a consistent L2D loss to train them. Moreover, by relying on a CBM architecture, DCBMs can explain why defer occurs on the final task. Our results show that DCBMs achieve high predictive performance and interpretability at the cost of deferring more to humans.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural differential equation models have garnered significant attention in recent years for their effectiveness in machine learning applications.Among these, fractional differential equations (FDEs) have emerged as a promising tool due to their ability to capture memory-dependent dynamics, which are often challenging to model with traditional integer-order approaches.While existing models have primarily focused on constant-order fractional derivatives, variable-order fractional operators offer a more flexible and expressive framework for modeling complex memory patterns. In this work, we introduce the Neural Variable-Order Fractional Differential Equation network (NvoFDE), a novel neural network framework that integrates variable-order fractional derivatives with learnable neural networks.Our framework allows for the modeling of adaptive derivative orders dependent on hidden features, capturing more complex feature-updating dynamics and providing enhanced flexibility. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple graph datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach.Our results demonstrate that NvoFDE outperforms traditional constant-order fractional and integer models across a range of tasks, showcasing its superior adaptability and performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies on massive computational resources and extensive datasets, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained settings. Our study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dawood Wasif, Terrence J. Moore, Jin-Hee Cho</p>
<p>Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) increasingly rely on Federated Learning (FL) to enhance perception models while preserving privacy. However, existing FL frameworks struggle to balance privacy, fairness, and robustness, leading to performance disparities across demographic groups. Privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy mitigate data leakage risks but worsen fairness by restricting access to sensitive attributes needed for bias correction. This work explores the trade-off between privacy and fairness in FL-based object detection for AVs and introduces RESFL, an integrated solution optimizing both. RESFL incorporates adversarial privacy disentanglement and uncertainty-guided fairness-aware aggregation. The adversarial component uses a gradient reversal layer to remove sensitive attributes, reducing privacy risks while maintaining fairness. The uncertainty-aware aggregation employs an evidential neural network to weight client updates adaptively, prioritizing contributions with lower fairness disparities and higher confidence. This ensures robust and equitable FL model updates. We evaluate RESFL on the FACET dataset and CARLA simulator, assessing accuracy, fairness, privacy resilience, and robustness under varying conditions. RESFL improves detection accuracy, reduces fairness disparities, and lowers privacy attack success rates while demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial conditions compared to other approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: The robustness of algorithms against covariate shifts is a fundamental problem with critical implications for the deployment of machine learning algorithms in the real world. Current evaluation methods predominantly match the robustness definition to that of standard generalization, relying on standard metrics like accuracy-based scores, which, while designed for performance assessment, lack a theoretical foundation encompassing their application in estimating robustness to distribution shifts. In this work, we set the desiderata for a robustness metric, and we propose a novel principled framework for the robustness assessment problem that directly follows the Posterior Agreement (PA) theory of model validation. Specifically, we extend the PA framework to the covariate shift setting by proposing a PA metric for robustness evaluation in supervised classification tasks. We assess the soundness of our metric in controlled environments and through an empirical robustness analysis in two different covariate shift scenarios: adversarial learning and domain generalization. We illustrate the suitability of PA by evaluating several models under different nature and magnitudes of shift, and proportion of affected observations. The results show that the PA metric provides a sensible and consistent analysis of the vulnerabilities in learning algorithms, even in the presence of few perturbed observations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuqi Lu, Haowei Lin, Lin Yao, Zhifeng Gao, Xiaohong Ji, Weinan E, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding ({3D GU}) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates {3D GU} tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these strategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse {3D GU} tasks within a single autoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic {3D GU} tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster.

<p>Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 50 million people worldwide and is projected to overwhelm 152 million by 2050. AD is characterized by cognitive decline due partly to disruptions in metabolic brain connectivity. Thus, early and accurate detection of metabolic brain network impairments is crucial for AD management. Chief to identifying such impairments is FDG-PET data. Despite advancements, most graph-based studies using FDG-PET data rely on group-level analysis or thresholding. Yet, group-level analysis can veil individual differences and thresholding may overlook weaker but biologically critical brain connections. Additionally, machine learning-based AD prediction largely focuses on univariate outcomes, such as disease status. Here, we introduce explainable graph-theoretical machine learning (XGML), a framework employing kernel density estimation and dynamic time warping to construct individual metabolic brain graphs that capture the distance between pair-wise brain regions and identify subgraphs most predictive of multivariate AD-related outcomes. Using FDG-PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, XGML builds metabolic brain graphs and uncovers subgraphs predictive of eight AD-related cognitive scores in new subjects. XGML shows robust performance, particularly for predicting scores measuring learning, memory, language, praxis, and orientation, such as CDRSB ($r = 0.74$), ADAS11 ($r = 0.73$), and ADAS13 ($r = 0.71$). Moreover, XGML unveils key edges jointly but differentially predictive of several AD-related outcomes; they may serve as potential network biomarkers for assessing overall cognitive decline. Together, we show the promise of graph-theoretical machine learning in biomarker discovery and disease prediction and its potential to improve our understanding of network neural mechanisms underlying AD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aritra Bhowmik, Fida Mohammad Thoker, Carlos Hinojosa, Bernard Ghanem, Cees G. M. Snoek</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked modeling has emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning framework, but existing methods largely rely on random masking, disregarding the structural properties of different modalities. In this work, we introduce structured noise-based masking, a simple yet effective approach that naturally aligns with the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of video and audio data. By filtering white noise into distinct color noise distributions, we generate structured masks that preserve modality-specific patterns without requiring handcrafted heuristics or access to the data. Our approach improves the performance of masked video and audio modeling frameworks without any computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that structured noise masking achieves consistent improvement over random masking for standard and advanced masked modeling methods, highlighting the importance of modality-aware masking strategies for representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanpeng Zhou, Yongyi Yang, Jie Ren, Mahito Sugiyama, Junchi Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks is a central topic in the deep learning community. In this paper, we take an empirical perspective to study the learning dynamics of neural networks in real-world settings. Specifically, we investigate the evolution process of the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK) during training. Our key findings reveal a two-phase learning process: i) in Phase I, the eNTK evolves significantly, signaling the rich regime, and ii) in Phase II, the eNTK keeps evolving but is constrained in a narrow space, a phenomenon we term the cone effect. This two-phase framework builds on the hypothesis proposed by Fort et al. (2020), but we uniquely identify the cone effect in Phase II, demonstrating its significant performance advantages over fully linearized training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyu Wang, Yijia Xu, Jingyi Huang, Zhengwei Yang, Zhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) techniques, by enabling non-contact acquisition of extensive ground observations, have become a valuable tool for corn yield prediction. Traditional process-based (PB) models are limited by fixed input features and struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized for being ``black boxes'' with limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we used Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), which combined the strengths of both approaches and fully used RS data. However, previous KGML methods overlooked the crucial role of soil moisture in plant growth. To bridge this gap, we proposed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, using soil moisture as an intermediate variable to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalizes predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other ML models. Finally, we explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction, assessing the importance of various features and analyzing how soil moisture impacts corn yield predictions across different regions and time periods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Chen Wang, Antoine De Comite, Monica Daley, Alexandra Voloshina, Nidhi Seethapathi</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling movement in real-world tasks is a fundamental scientific goal. However, it is unclear whether existing models and their assumptions, overwhelmingly tested in laboratory-constrained settings, generalize to the real world. For example, data-driven models of foot placement control -- a crucial action for stable locomotion -- assume linear and single timescale mappings. We develop nonlinear foot placement prediction models, finding that neural network architectures with flexible input history-dependence like GRU and Transformer perform best across multiple contexts (walking and running, treadmill and overground, varying terrains) and input modalities (multiple body states, gaze), outperforming traditional models. These models reveal context- and modality-dependent timescales: there is more reliance on fast-timescale predictions in complex terrain, gaze predictions precede body state predictions, and full-body state predictions precede center-of-mass-relevant predictions. Thus, nonlinear action prediction models provide quantifiable insights into real-world motor control and can be extended to other actions, contexts, and populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoqi He, Yan Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Estimating the global Lipschitz constant of neural networks is crucial for understanding and improving their robustness and generalization capabilities. However, precise calculations are NP-hard, and current semidefinite programming (SDP) methods face challenges such as high memory usage and slow processing speeds. In this paper, we propose \textbf{HiQ-Lip}, a hybrid quantum-classical hierarchical method that leverages Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) to estimate the global Lipschitz constant. We tackle the estimation by converting it into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement strategy to adapt to the constraints of contemporary quantum hardware. Our experimental evaluations on fully connected neural networks demonstrate that HiQ-Lip not only provides estimates comparable to state-of-the-art methods but also significantly accelerates the computation process. In specific tests involving two-layer neural networks with 256 hidden neurons, HiQ-Lip doubles the solving speed and offers more accurate upper bounds than the existing best method, LiPopt. These findings highlight the promising utility of small-scale quantum devices in advancing the estimation of neural network robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks and Transformers have revolutionized biological sequence modeling, with recent advances driven by scaling up foundation and task-specific models. The computational resources and large datasets required, however, limit their applicability in biological contexts. We introduce Lyra, a subquadratic architecture for sequence modeling, grounded in the biological framework of epistasis for understanding sequence-to-function relationships. Mathematically, we demonstrate that state space models efficiently capture global epistatic interactions and combine them with projected gated convolutions for modeling local relationships. We demonstrate that Lyra is performant across over 100 wide-ranging biological tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many key areas, including protein fitness landscape prediction, biophysical property prediction (e.g. disordered protein region functions) peptide engineering applications (e.g. antibody binding, cell-penetrating peptide prediction), RNA structure analysis, RNA function prediction, and CRISPR guide design. It achieves this with orders-of-magnitude improvements in inference speed and reduction in parameters (up to 120,000-fold in our tests) compared to recent biology foundation models. Using Lyra, we were able to train and run every task in this study on two or fewer GPUs in under two hours, democratizing access to biological sequence modeling at SOTA performance, with potential applications to many fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoqi He, Yan Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computing holds significant potential to accelerate machine learning algorithms, especially in solving optimization problems like those encountered in Support Vector Machine (SVM) training. However, current QUBO-based Quantum SVM (QSVM) methods rely solely on binary optimal solutions, limiting their ability to identify fuzzy boundaries in data. Additionally, the limited qubit count in contemporary quantum devices constrains training on larger datasets. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic quantum SVM training framework suitable for Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs). By formulating the SVM training problem as a QUBO model, we leverage CIMs' energy minimization capabilities and introduce a Boltzmann distribution-based probabilistic approach to better approximate optimal SVM solutions, enhancing robustness. To address qubit limitations, we employ batch processing and multi-batch ensemble strategies, enabling small-scale quantum devices to train SVMs on larger datasets and support multi-class classification tasks via a one-vs-one approach. Our method is validated through simulations and real-machine experiments on binary and multi-class datasets. On the banknote binary classification dataset, our CIM-based QSVM, utilizing an energy-based probabilistic approach, achieved up to 20% higher accuracy compared to the original QSVM, while training up to $10^4$ times faster than simulated annealing methods. Compared with classical SVM, our approach either matched or reduced training time. On the IRIS three-class dataset, our improved QSVM outperformed existing QSVM models in all key metrics. As quantum technology advances, increased qubit counts are expected to further enhance QSVM performance relative to classical SVM.</p>

Since idempotents carry representations of the algebra under consideration, they form algebraic varieties and smooth manifolds in the natural topology. In addition to the motivation of linking up mathematical physics with machine learning, it is also shown that by using idempotents and invariant subspace of the corresponding algebras, these representations encode and perhaps provide a probabilistic interpretation of reasoning and relational paths in geometrical terms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anurag Singh, Siu Lun Chau, Krikamol Muandet</p>
<p>Abstract: The quality of probabilistic forecasts is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty. While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haolin Yang, Feilong Tang, Ming Hu, Yulong Li, Junjie Guo, Yexin Liu, Zelin Peng, Junjun He, Zongyuan Ge, Imran Razzak</p>
<p>Abstract: Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality videos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts during training through improvements in data quality, computational resources, and model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and Vision language models (VLMs) have been able to perform various forms of reasoning tasks in a wide range of scenarios, but are they truly engaging in task abstraction and rule-based reasoning beyond mere memorization and pattern matching? To answer this question, we propose a novel experimental approach, Misleading Fine-Tuning (MisFT), to examine whether LLMs/VLMs perform abstract reasoning by altering their original understanding of fundamental rules. In particular, by constructing a dataset with math expressions that contradict correct operation principles, we fine-tune the model to learn those contradictory rules and assess its generalization ability on different test domains. Through a series of experiments, we find that current LLMs/VLMs are capable of effectively applying contradictory rules to solve practical math word problems and math expressions represented by images, implying the presence of an internal mechanism that abstracts before reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: In human-robot interaction (HRI), the beginning of an interaction is often complex. Whether the robot should communicate with the human is dependent on several situational factors (e.g., the current human's activity, urgency of the interaction, etc.). We test whether large language models (LLM) and vision language models (VLM) can provide solutions to this problem. We compare four different system-design patterns using LLMs and VLMs, and test on a test set containing 84 human-robot situations. The test set mixes several publicly available datasets and also includes situations where the appropriate action to take is open-ended. Our results using the GPT-4o and Phi-3 Vision model indicate that LLMs and VLMs are capable of handling interaction beginnings when the desired actions are clear, however, challenge remains in the open-ended situations where the model must balance between the human and robot situation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning produces models that are impossible for users or developers to fully understand -- raising concerns about trust, oversight and human dignity. Transparency and explainability methods aim to provide some help in understanding models, but it remains challenging for developers to design explanations that are understandable to target users and effective for their purpose. Emerging guidelines and regulations set goals but may not provide effective actionable guidance to developers. In a controlled experiment with 124 participants, we investigate whether and how specific forms of policy guidance help developers design explanations for an ML-powered screening tool for diabetic retinopathy. Contrary to our expectations, we found that participants across the board struggled to produce quality explanations, comply with the provided policy requirements for explainability, and provide evidence of compliance. We posit that participant noncompliance is in part due to a failure to imagine and anticipate the needs of their audience, particularly non-technical stakeholders. Drawing on cognitive process theory and the sociological imagination to contextualize participants' failure, we recommend educational interventions.</p>

<p>Abstract: More and more people are experiencing pressure from work, life, and education. These pressures often lead to an anxious state of mind, or even the early symptoms of suicidal ideation. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, large language models have become one of the most prominent technologies. They are often used for detecting psychological disorders. However, current studies primarily provide categorization results without offering interpretable explanations for these results. To address this gap, this study adopts a person-centered perspective and focuses on GPT-generated multi-scenario simulated conversations. These simulated conversations were selected as data samples for the study. Various transformer-based encoder models were utilized to develop a classification model capable of identifying different levels of anxiety. Additionally, a knowledge base focusing on anxiety was constructed using LangChain and GPT-4. When analyzing classification results, this knowledge base was able to provide explanations and reasons most relevant to the interlocutor's anxiety situation. The study demonstrates that the proposed model achieves over 94% accuracy in categorical prediction, and the advice provided is highly personalized and relevant.</p>

<p>Abstract: Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shih-Chieh Dai, Jun Xu, Guanhong Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: LLMs are widely used in software development. However, the code generated by LLMs often contains vulnerabilities. Several secure code generation methods have been proposed to address this issue, but their current evaluation schemes leave several concerns unaddressed. Specifically, most existing studies evaluate security and functional correctness separately, using different datasets. That is, they assess vulnerabilities using security-related code datasets while validating functionality with general code datasets. In addition, prior research primarily relies on a single static analyzer, CodeQL, to detect vulnerabilities in generated code, which limits the scope of security evaluation.
  In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to systematically assess the improvements introduced by four state-of-the-art secure code generation techniques. Specifically, we apply both security inspection and functionality validation to the same generated code and evaluate these two aspects together. We also employ three popular static analyzers and two LLMs to identify potential vulnerabilities in the generated code. Our study reveals that existing techniques often compromise the functionality of generated code to enhance security. Their overall performance remains limited when evaluating security and functionality together. In fact, many techniques even degrade the performance of the base LLM. Our further inspection reveals that these techniques often either remove vulnerable lines of code entirely or generate ``garbage code'' that is unrelated to the intended task. Moreover, the commonly used static analyzer CodeQL fails to detect several vulnerabilities, further obscuring the actual security improvements achieved by existing techniques. Our study serves as a guideline for a more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of secure code generation performance in future work.</p>

<p>Abstract: Physical AI systems need to perceive, understand, and perform complex actions in the physical world. In this paper, we present the Cosmos-Reason1 models that can understand the physical world and generate appropriate embodied decisions (e.g., next step action) in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning, we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-8B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data and train our models in four stages: vision pre-training, general supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Physical AI SFT, and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL) as the post-training. To evaluate our models, we build comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning bring significant improvements. To facilitate the development of Physical AI, we will make our code and pre-trained models available under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prashant Kulkarni, Assaf Namer</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated multi-turn manipulation attacks, where adversaries strategically build context through seemingly benign conversational turns to circumvent safety measures and elicit harmful or unauthorized responses. These attacks exploit the temporal nature of dialogue to evade single-turn detection methods, representing a critical security vulnerability with significant implications for real-world deployments.
  This paper introduces the Temporal Context Awareness (TCA) framework, a novel defense mechanism designed to address this challenge by continuously analyzing semantic drift, cross-turn intention consistency and evolving conversational patterns. The TCA framework integrates dynamic context embedding analysis, cross-turn consistency verification, and progressive risk scoring to detect and mitigate manipulation attempts effectively. Preliminary evaluations on simulated adversarial scenarios demonstrate the framework's potential to identify subtle manipulation patterns often missed by traditional detection techniques, offering a much-needed layer of security for conversational AI systems. In addition to outlining the design of TCA , we analyze diverse attack vectors and their progression across multi-turn conversation, providing valuable insights into adversarial tactics and their impact on LLM vulnerabilities. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust, context-aware defenses in conversational AI systems and highlight TCA framework as a promising direction for securing LLMs while preserving their utility in legitimate applications. We make our implementation available to support further research in this emerging area of AI security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pankaj Thorat, Adnan Qidwai, Adrija Dhar, Aishwariya Chakraborty, Anand Eswaran, Hima Patel, Praveen Jayachandran</p>
<p>Abstract: Data profiling is critical in machine learning for generating descriptive statistics, supporting both deeper understanding and downstream tasks like data valuation and curation. This work addresses profiling specifically in the context of code datasets for Large Language Models (code-LLMs), where data quality directly influences tasks such as code generation and summarization. Characterizing code datasets in terms of programming language concepts enables better insights and targeted data curation. Our proposed methodology decomposes code data profiling into two phases: (1) an offline phase where LLMs are leveraged to derive and learn rules for extracting syntactic and semantic concepts across various programming languages, including previously unseen or low-resource languages, and (2) an online deterministic phase applying these derived rules for efficient real-time analysis. This hybrid approach is customizable, extensible to new syntactic and semantic constructs, and scalable to multiple languages. Experimentally, our LLM-aided method achieves a mean accuracy of 90.33% for syntactic extraction rules and semantic classification accuracies averaging 80% and 77% across languages and semantic concepts, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Passive Acoustic Monitoring with automatic recorders is essential for ecosystem conservation but generates vast unsupervised audio data, posing challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning techniques offer a promising solution. BirdNET, a widely used model for bird identification, has shown success in many study systems but is limited in some regions due to biases in its training data. A key challenge in bird species detection is that many recordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations. To overcome these problems, we developed a multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a region facing significant conservation threats. Our approach included a Bird Song Detector to isolate vocalizations and custom classifiers trained with BirdNET embeddings. We manually annotated 461 minutes of audio from three habitats across nine locations, yielding 3,749 annotations for 34 classes. Spectrograms facilitated the use of image processing techniques. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved species identification, as all classification models performed better when analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the combination of the Bird Song Detector and fine-tuned BirdNET compared to the baseline without the Bird Song Detector. Our approach demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with fine-tuned classification models for bird identification at local soundscapes. These findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools for specific ecological challenges, as demonstrated in Do\~nana. Automatically detecting bird species serves for tracking the health status of this threatened ecosystem, given the sensitivity of birds to environmental changes, and helps in the design of conservation measures for reducing biodiversity loss</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Ritzert, Polina Turishcheva, Laura Hansel, Paul Wollenhaupt, Marissa Weis, Alexander Ecker</p>
<p>Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is an effective and interpretable technique for analyzing structure in data, offering a nuanced understanding by revealing insights at multiple scales and resolutions. It is particularly helpful in settings where the exact number of clusters is unknown, and provides a robust framework for exploring complex datasets. Additionally, hierarchical clustering can uncover inner structures within clusters, capturing subtle relationships and nested patterns that may be obscured by traditional flat clustering methods. However, existing hierarchical clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional data, especially when there are no clear density gaps between modes. Our method addresses this limitation by leveraging a two-stage approach, first employing a Gaussian or Student's t mixture model to overcluster the data, and then hierarchically merging clusters based on the induced density landscape. This approach yields state-of-the-art clustering performance while also providing a meaningful hierarchy, making it a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Austin Xu, Srijan Bansal, Yifei Ming, Semih Yavuz, Shafiq Joty</p>
<p>Abstract: The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the demand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI system development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models -- LLMs finetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been touted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on non-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of contextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to generate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual assessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner priorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing responses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are equally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge benchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by real-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a multi-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human annotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11 judge models and 9 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual information and its assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even state-of-the-art models. For example, OpenAI's o1, the best-performing model, barely reaches 55% consistent accuracy.</p>

This paper presents a novel, sample-efficient method for neural approximation of nonlinear Lyapunov functions, leveraging self-supervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance training data generation, particularly for inaccurately represented regions of the state space. The proposed approach employs a data-driven World Model to train Lyapunov functions from off-policy trajectories.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaitlin Gili, Kyle Heuton, Astha Shah, Michael C. Hughes</p>
<p>Abstract: In the education system, problem-solving correctness is often inappropriately conflated with student learning. Advances in both Physics Education Research (PER) and Machine Learning (ML) provide the initial tools to develop a more meaningful and efficient measurement scheme for whether physics students are engaging in sensemaking: a learning process of figuring out the how and why for a particular phenomena. In this work, we contribute such a measurement scheme, which quantifies the evidence of students' physical sensemaking given their written explanations for their solutions to physics problems. We outline how the proposed human annotation scheme can be automated into a deployable ML model using language encoders and shared probabilistic classifiers. The procedure is scalable for a large number of problems and students. We implement three unique language encoders with logistic regression, and provide a deployability analysis on 385 real student explanations from the 2023 Introduction to Physics course at Tufts University. Furthermore, we compute sensemaking scores for all students, and analyze these measurements alongside their corresponding problem-solving accuracies. We find no linear relationship between these two variables, supporting the hypothesis that one is not a reliable proxy for the other. We discuss how sensemaking scores can be used alongside problem-solving accuracies to provide a more nuanced snapshot of student performance in physics class.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jumanh Atoum, Garrison L. H. Johnston, Nabil Simaan, Jie Ying Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognizing surgical gestures in real-time is a stepping stone towards automated activity recognition, skill assessment, intra-operative assistance, and eventually surgical automation. The current robotic surgical systems provide us with rich multi-modal data such as video and kinematics. While some recent works in multi-modal neural networks learn the relationships between vision and kinematics data, current approaches treat kinematics information as independent signals, with no underlying relation between tool-tip poses. However, instrument poses are geometrically related, and the underlying geometry can aid neural networks in learning gesture representation. Therefore, we propose combining motion invariant measures (curvature and torsion) with vision and kinematics data using a relational graph network to capture the underlying relations between different data streams. We show that gesture recognition improves when combining invariant signals with tool position, achieving 90.3\% frame-wise accuracy on the JIGSAWS suturing dataset. Our results show that motion invariant signals coupled with position are better representations of gesture motion compared to traditional position and quaternion representations. Our results highlight the need for geometric-aware modeling of kinematics for gesture recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Sundar, Didier Lucor, Sunetra Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: For a data-driven and physics combined modelling of unsteady flow systems with moving immersed boundaries, Sundar {\it et al.} introduced an immersed boundary-aware (IBA) framework, combining Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the immersed boundary method (IBM). This approach was beneficial because it avoided case-specific transformations to a body-attached reference frame. Building on this, we now address the challenges of long time integration in velocity reconstruction and pressure recovery by extending this IBA framework with sequential learning strategies. Key difficulties for PINNs in long time integration include temporal sparsity, long temporal domains and rich spectral content. To tackle these, a moving boundary-enabled PINN is developed, proposing two sequential learning strategies: - a time marching with gradual increase in time domain size, however, this approach struggles with error accumulation over long time domains; and - a time decomposition which divides the temporal domain into smaller segments, combined with transfer learning it effectively reduces error propagation and computational complexity. The key findings for modelling of incompressible unsteady flows past a flapping airfoil include: - for quasi-periodic flows, the time decomposition approach with preferential spatio-temporal sampling improves accuracy and efficiency for pressure recovery and aerodynamic load reconstruction, and, - for long time domains, decomposing it into smaller temporal segments and employing multiple sub-networks, simplifies the problem ensuring stability and reduced network sizes. This study highlights the limitations of traditional PINNs for long time integration of flow-structure interaction problems and demonstrates the benefits of decomposition-based strategies for addressing error accumulation, computational cost, and complex dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroki Hanai, Takuya Kiyokawa, Weiwei Wan, Kensuke Harada</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material's complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot's arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties.
  This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials.
  The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated successful task completion with a significant reduction in tear and wrinkle rates. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the approximation properties of shallow neural networks whose activation function is defined as the flow of a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) at the final time of the integration interval. We prove the universal approximation property (UAP) of such shallow neural networks in the space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we investigate the approximation properties of shallow neural networks whose parameters are required to satisfy some constraints. In particular, we constrain the Lipschitz constant of the flow of the neural ODE to increase the stability of the shallow neural network, and we restrict the norm of the weight matrices of the linear layers to one to make sure that the restricted expansivity of the flow is not compensated by the increased expansivity of the linear layers. For this setting, we prove approximation bounds that tell us the accuracy to which we can approximate a continuous function with a shallow neural network with such constraints. We prove that the UAP holds if we consider only the constraint on the Lipschitz constant of the flow or the unit norm constraint on the weight matrices of the linear layers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kyurae Kim, Zuheng Xu, Jacob R. Gardner, Trevor Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers heavily depends on the tuning of the Markov kernels used in the path proposal. For SMC samplers with unadjusted Markov kernels, standard tuning objectives, such as the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance rate or the expected-squared jump distance, are no longer applicable. While stochastic gradient-based end-to-end optimization has been explored for tuning SMC samplers, they often incur excessive training costs, even for tuning just the kernel step sizes. In this work, we propose a general adaptation framework for tuning the Markov kernels in SMC samplers by minimizing the incremental Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the proposal and target paths. For step size tuning, we provide a gradient- and tuning-free algorithm that is generally applicable for kernels such as Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by providing a tailored scheme for tuning \textit{kinetic} LMC used in SMC samplers. Our implementations are able to obtain a full \textit{schedule} of tuned parameters at the cost of a few vanilla SMC runs, which is a fraction of gradient-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan D. Schultz, Kelsey A. Parker, Bashir Sbaiti, David N. Beratan</p>
<p>Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has enabled significant discoveries in both biological and synthetic energy-transducing systems. Although deriving chemical information from 2DES is a complex task, machine learning (ML) offers exciting opportunities to translate complicated spectroscopic data into physical insight. Recent studies have found that neural networks (NNs) can map simulated multidimensional spectra to molecular-scale properties with high accuracy. However, simulations often do not capture experimental factors that influence real spectra, including noise and suboptimal pulse resonance conditions, bringing into question the experimental utility of NNs trained on simulated data. Here, we show how factors associated with experimental 2D spectral data influence the ability of NNs to map simulated 2DES spectra onto underlying intermolecular electronic couplings. By systematically introducing multisourced noise into a library of 356000 simulated 2D spectra, we show that noise does not hamper NN performance for spectra exceeding threshold signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (> 6.6 if background noise dominates vs. > 2.5 for intensity-dependent noise). In stark contrast to human-based analyses of 2DES data, we find that the NN accuracy improves significantly (ca. 84% $\rightarrow$ 96%) when the data are constrained by the bandwidth and center frequency of the pump pulses. This result is consistent with the NN learning the optical trends described by Kasha's theory of molecular excitons. Our findings convey positive prospects for adapting simulation-trained NNs to extract molecular properties from inherently imperfect experimental 2DES data. More broadly, we propose that machine-learned perspectives of nonlinear spectroscopic data may produce unique and, perhaps, counterintuitive guidelines for experimental design.</p>

<p>Abstract: Blockchain is increasingly offered as blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) by cloud service providers. However, configuring BaaS appropriately for optimal performance and reliability resorts to try-and-error. A key challenge is that BaaS is often perceived as a ``black-box,'' leading to uncertainties in performance and resource provisioning. Previous studies attempted to address this challenge; however, the impacts of both vertical and horizontal scaling remain elusive. To this end, we present machine learning-based models to predict network reliability and throughput based on scaling configurations. In our evaluation, the models exhibit prediction errors of ~1.9%, which is highly accurate and can be applied in the real-world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyi Shen, Tetsuro Miyazaki, Kenji Kawashima</p>
<p>Abstract: The intrinsic nonlinearities of soft robots present significant control but simultaneously provide them with rich computational potential. Reservoir computing (RC) has shown effectiveness in online learning systems for controlling nonlinear systems such as soft actuators. Conventional RC can be extended into physical reservoir computing (PRC) by leveraging the nonlinear dynamics of soft actuators for computation. This paper introduces a PRC-based online learning framework to control the motion of a pneumatic soft bending actuator, utilizing another pneumatic soft actuator as the PRC model. Unlike conventional designs requiring two RC models, the proposed control system employs a more compact architecture with a single RC model. Additionally, the framework enables zero-shot online learning, addressing limitations of previous PRC-based control systems reliant on offline training. Simulations and experiments validated the performance of the proposed system. Experimental results indicate that the PRC model achieved superior control performance compared to a linear model, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by an average of over 37% in bending motion control tasks. The proposed PRC-based online learning control framework provides a novel approach for harnessing physical systems' inherent nonlinearities to enhance the control of soft actuators.</p>

<p>Abstract: The digital twin edge network (DITEN) is a significant paradigm in the sixth-generation wireless system (6G) that aims to organize well-developed infrastructures to meet the requirements of evolving application scenarios. However, the impact of the interaction between the long-term DITEN maintenance and detailed digital twin tasks, which often entail privacy considerations, is commonly overlooked in current research. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a problem of digital twin association and historical data allocation for a federated learning (FL) task within DITEN. To achieve this goal, we start by introducing a closed-form function to predict the training accuracy of the FL task, referring to it as the data utility. Subsequently, we carry out comprehensive convergence analyses on the proposed FL methodology. Our objective is to jointly optimize the data utility of the digital twin-empowered FL task and the energy costs incurred by the long-term DITEN maintenance, encompassing FL model training, data synchronization, and twin migration.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Liu, Wenya Wang, Kecheng Chen, Jie Liu, Yibing Liu, Tiexin Qin, Peisong He, Xinghao Jiang, Haoliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In zero-shot image recognition tasks, humans demonstrate remarkable flexibility in classifying unseen categories by composing known simpler concepts. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs), despite achieving significant progress through large-scale natural language supervision, often underperform in real-world applications because of sub-optimal prompt engineering and the inability to adapt effectively to target classes. To address these issues, we propose a Concept-guided Human-like Bayesian Reasoning (CHBR) framework. Grounded in Bayes' theorem, CHBR models the concept used in human image recognition as latent variables and formulates this task by summing across potential concepts, weighted by a prior distribution and a likelihood function. To tackle the intractable computation over an infinite concept space, we introduce an importance sampling algorithm that iteratively prompts large language models (LLMs) to generate discriminative concepts, emphasizing inter-class differences. We further propose three heuristic approaches involving Average Likelihood, Confidence Likelihood, and Test Time Augmentation (TTA) Likelihood, which dynamically refine the combination of concepts based on the test image. Extensive evaluations across fifteen datasets demonstrate that CHBR consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junho Kim, Gwangtak Bae, Eun Sun Lee, Young Min Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding scene contexts is crucial for machines to perform tasks and adapt prior knowledge in unseen or noisy 3D environments. As data-driven learning is intractable to comprehensively encapsulate diverse ranges of layouts and open spaces, we propose teaching machines to identify relational commonalities in 3D spaces. Instead of focusing on point-wise or object-wise representations, we introduce 3D scene analogies, which are smooth maps between 3D scene regions that align spatial relationships. Unlike well-studied single instance-level maps, these scene-level maps smoothly link large scene regions, potentially enabling unique applications in trajectory transfer in AR/VR, long demonstration transfer for imitation learning, and context-aware object rearrangement. To find 3D scene analogies, we propose neural contextual scene maps, which extract descriptor fields summarizing semantic and geometric contexts, and holistically align them in a coarse-to-fine manner for map estimation. This approach reduces reliance on individual feature points, making it robust to input noise or shape variations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying scene analogies and transferring trajectories or object placements in diverse indoor scenes, indicating its potential for robotics and AR/VR applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amit Kumar Mondal, Nafisha Aslam, Prasenjit Maji, Hemanta Kumar Mondal</p>
<p>Abstract: The potential for catastrophic collision makes near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) a serious concern. Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions. Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work explores optimizing transformer-based language models by integrating model compression techniques with inhibitor attention, a novel alternative attention mechanism. Inhibitor attention employs Manhattan distances and ReLU activations instead of the matrix multiplications and softmax activation of the conventional scaled dot-product attention. This shift offers potential computational and energy savings while maintaining model effectiveness. We propose further adjustments to improve the inhibitor mechanism's training efficiency and evaluate its performance on the DistilBERT architecture. Our knowledge distillation experiments indicate that the modified inhibitor transformer model can achieve competitive performance on standard NLP benchmarks, including General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and sentiment analysis tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider a patch-based learning approach defined in terms of neural networks to estimate spatially adaptive regularisation parameter maps for image denoising with weighted Total Variation and test it to situations when the noise distribution is unknown. As an example, we consider situations where noise could be either Gaussian or Poisson and perform preliminary model selection by a standard binary classification network. Then, we define a patch-based approach where at each image pixel an optimal weighting between TV regularisation and the corresponding data fidelity is learned in a supervised way using reference natural image patches upon optimisation of SSIM and in a sliding window fashion. Extensive numerical results are reported for both noise models, showing significant improvement w.r.t. results obtained by means of optimal scalar regularisation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as mainstream framework in visual generation. Building upon this success, the integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods has shown promise in enhancing model scalability and performance. In this paper, we introduce Race-DiT, a novel MoE model for diffusion transformers with a flexible routing strategy, Expert Race. By allowing tokens and experts to compete together and select the top candidates, the model learns to dynamically assign experts to critical tokens. Additionally, we propose per-layer regularization to address challenges in shallow layer learning, and router similarity loss to prevent mode collapse, ensuring better expert utilization. Extensive experiments on ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant performance gains while promising scaling properties.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring food safety and quality is critical in the food processing industry, where the detection of contaminants remains a persistent challenge. This study presents an automated solution for detecting foreign objects on pork belly meat using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A hyperspectral camera was used to capture data across various bands in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum (900-1700 nm), enabling accurate identification of contaminants that are often undetectable through traditional visual inspection methods. The proposed solution combines pre-processing techniques with a segmentation approach based on a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) to distinguish contaminants from meat, fat, and conveyor belt materials. The adopted strategy demonstrates high detection accuracy and training efficiency, while also addressing key industrial challenges such as inherent noise, temperature variations, and spectral similarity between contaminants and pork belly. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of hyperspectral imaging in enhancing food safety, highlighting its potential for broad real-time applications in automated quality control processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Runze You, Shi Pu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which $n$ agents, each with potentially heterogeneous local data, collaboratively minimize the sum of their local cost functions via peer-to-peer communication. We propose a novel algorithm, Spanning Tree Push-Pull (STPP), which employs two spanning trees extracted from a general communication graph to distribute both model parameters and stochastic gradients. Unlike prior approaches that rely heavily on spectral gap properties, STPP leverages a more flexible topological characterization, enabling robust information flow and efficient updates. Theoretically, we prove that STPP achieves linear speedup and polynomial transient iteration complexity, up to $O(n^7)$ for smooth nonconvex objectives and $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ for smooth strongly convex objectives, under arbitrary network topologies. Moreover, compared with the existing methods, STPP achieves faster convergence rates on sparse and non-regular topologies (e.g., directed ring) and reduces communication overhead on dense networks (e.g., static exponential graph). These results significantly advance the state of the art, especially when $n$ is large. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the strong performance of STPP and confirm the practical relevance of its theoretical convergence rates across various common graph architectures.

<p>Abstract: Efforts to address declining accuracy as a result of data shifts often involve various data-augmentation strategies. Adversarial training is one such method, designed to improve robustness to worst-case distribution shifts caused by adversarial examples. While this method can improve robustness, it may also hinder generalization to clean examples and exacerbate performance imbalances across different classes. This paper explores the impact of adversarial training on both overall and class-specific performance, as well as its spill-over effects. We observe that enhanced labeling during training boosts adversarial robustness by 53.50% and mitigates class imbalances by 5.73%, leading to improved accuracy in both clean and adversarial settings compared to standard adversarial training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinon Goldshtein, Gal Perelman, Assaf Schuster, Avi Ostfeld</p>
<p>Abstract: The design, operations, and management of water distribution systems (WDS) involve complex mathematical models. These models are continually improving due to computational advancements, leading to better decision-making and more efficient WDS management. However, the significant time and effort required for modeling, programming, and analyzing results remain substantial challenges. Another issue is the professional burden, which confines the interaction with models, databases, and other sophisticated tools to a small group of experts, thereby causing non-technical stakeholders to depend on these experts or make decisions without modeling support. Furthermore, explaining model results is challenging even for experts, as it is often unclear which conditions cause the model to reach a certain state or recommend a specific policy. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) open doors for a new stage in human-model interaction. This study proposes a framework of plain language interactions with hydraulic and water quality models based on LLM-EPANET architecture. This framework is tested with increasing levels of complexity of queries to study the ability of LLMs to interact with WDS models, run complex simulations, and report simulation results. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated across several categories of queries and hyper-parameter configurations, demonstrating its potential to enhance decision-making processes in WDS management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chia-Yi Hsu, Jia-You Chen, Yu-Lin Tsai, Chih-Hsun Lin, Pin-Yu Chen, Chia-Mu Yu, Chun-Ying Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data has become the de facto standard for releasing sensitive data. However, many DP generative models suffer from the low utility of synthetic data, especially for high-resolution images. On the other hand, one of the emerging techniques in parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is visual prompting (VP), which allows well-trained existing models to be reused for the purpose of adapting to subsequent downstream tasks. In this work, we explore such a phenomenon in constructing captivating generative models with DP constraints. We show that VP in conjunction with DP-NTK, a DP generator that exploits the power of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) in training DP generative models, achieves a significant performance boost, particularly for high-resolution image datasets, with accuracy improving from 0.644$\pm$0.044 to 0.769. Lastly, we perform ablation studies on the effect of different parameters that influence the overall performance of VP-NTK. Our work demonstrates a promising step forward in improving the utility of DP synthetic data, particularly for high-resolution images.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16206">Interpretable Neural Causal Models with TRAM-DAGs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Beate Sick, Oliver D\"urr</p>
<p>Abstract: The ultimate goal of most scientific studies is to understand the underlying causal mechanism between the involved variables. Structural causal models (SCMs) are widely used to represent such causal mechanisms. Given an SCM, causal queries on all three levels of Pearl's causal hierarchy can be answered: $L_1$ observational, $L_2$ interventional, and $L_3$ counterfactual. An essential aspect of modeling the SCM is to model the dependency of each variable on its causal parents. Traditionally this is done by parametric statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression models. This allows to handle all kinds of data types and fit interpretable models but bears the risk of introducing a bias. More recently neural causal models came up using neural networks (NNs) to model the causal relationships, allowing the estimation of nearly any underlying functional form without bias. However, current neural causal models are generally restricted to continuous variables and do not yield an interpretable form of the causal relationships. Transformation models range from simple statistical regressions to complex networks and can handle continuous, ordinal, and binary data. Here, we propose to use TRAMs to model the functional relationships in SCMs allowing us to bridge the gap between interpretability and flexibility in causal modeling. We call this method TRAM-DAG and assume currently that the underlying directed acyclic graph is known. For the fully observed case, we benchmark TRAM-DAGs against state-of-the-art statistical and NN-based causal models. We show that TRAM-DAGs are interpretable but also achieve equal or superior performance in queries ranging from $L_1$ to $L_3$ in the causal hierarchy. For the continuous case, TRAM-DAGs allow for counterfactual queries for three common causal structures, including unobserved confounding.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines how trust is formed, maintained, or diminished over time in the context of human-autonomy teaming with an optionally piloted aircraft. Whereas traditional factor-based trust models offer a static representation of human confidence in technology, here we discuss how variations in the underlying factors lead to variations in trust, trust thresholds, and human behaviours. Over 200 hours of flight test data collected over a multi-year test campaign from 2021 to 2023 were reviewed. The dispositional-situational-learned, process-performance-purpose, and IMPACTS homeostasis trust models are applied to illuminate trust trends during nominal autonomous flight operations. The results offer promising directions for future studies on trust dynamics and design-for-trust in human-autonomy teaming.</p>

<p>Abstract: The growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical domains such as healthcare demands robust mechanisms to ensure the trustworthiness of these systems, especially when faced with unexpected or anomalous inputs. This paper introduces the Open Medical Imaging Benchmarks for Out-Of-Distribution Detection (OpenMIBOOD), a comprehensive framework for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods specifically in medical imaging contexts. OpenMIBOOD includes three benchmarks from diverse medical domains, encompassing 14 datasets divided into covariate-shifted in-distribution, near-OOD, and far-OOD categories. We evaluate 24 post-hoc methods across these benchmarks, providing a standardized reference to advance the development and fair comparison of OOD detection methods. Results reveal that findings from broad-scale OOD benchmarks in natural image domains do not translate to medical applications, underscoring the critical need for such benchmarks in the medical field. By mitigating the risk of exposing AI models to inputs outside their training distribution, OpenMIBOOD aims to support the advancement of reliable and trustworthy AI systems in healthcare.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Potter, Beyza Kalkanl{\i}, Deniz Erdo\u{g}mu\c{s}, Michael Everett</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the optimal diagnostic test and hardware system instance to infer reliability characteristics using field data is challenging, especially when constrained by fixed budgets and minimal maintenance cycles. Active Learning (AL) has shown promise for parameter inference with limited data and budget constraints in machine learning/deep learning tasks. However, AL for reliability model parameter inference remains underexplored for repairable hardware systems. It requires specialized AL Acquisition Functions (AFs) that consider hardware aging and the fact that a hardware system consists of multiple sub-systems, which may undergo only partial testing during a given diagnostic test. To address these challenges, we propose a relaxed Mixed Integer Semidefinite Program (MISDP) AL AF that incorporates Diagnostic Coverage (DC), Fisher Information Matrices (FIMs), and diagnostic testing budgets. Furthermore, we design empirical-based simulation experiments focusing on two diagnostic testing scenarios: (1) partial tests of a hardware system with overlapping subsystem coverage, and (2) partial tests where one diagnostic test fully subsumes the subsystem coverage of another. We evaluate our proposed approach against the most widely used AL AF in the literature (entropy), as well as several intuitive AL AFs tailored for reliability model parameter inference. Our proposed AF ranked best on average among the alternative AFs across 6,000 experimental configurations, with respect to Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Absolute Total Expected Event Error (ATEER) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) curves, with statistical significance calculated at a 0.05 alpha level using a Friedman hypothesis test.</p>

<p>Abstract: NeuralFoil is an open-source Python-based tool for rapid aerodynamics analysis of airfoils, similar in purpose to XFoil. Speedups ranging from 8x to 1,000x over XFoil are demonstrated, after controlling for equivalent accuracy. NeuralFoil computes both global and local quantities (lift, drag, velocity distribution, etc.) over a broad input space, including: an 18-dimensional space of airfoil shapes, possibly including control deflections; a 360 degree range of angles of attack; Reynolds numbers from $10^2$ to $10^{10}$; subsonic flows up to the transonic drag rise; and with varying turbulence parameters. Results match those of XFoil closely: the mean relative error of drag is 0.37% on simple cases, and remains as low as 2.0% on a test dataset with numerous post-stall and transitional cases. NeuralFoil facilitates gradient-based design optimization, due to its $C^\infty$-continuous solutions, automatic-differentiation-compatibility, and bounded computational cost without non-convergence issues.
  NeuralFoil is a hybrid of physics-informed machine learning techniques and analytical models. Here, physics information includes symmetries that are structurally embedded into the model architecture, feature engineering using domain knowledge, and guaranteed extrapolation to known limit cases. This work also introduces a new approach for surrogate model uncertainty quantification that enables robust design optimization.
  This work discusses the methodology and performance of NeuralFoil with several case studies, including a practical airfoil design optimization study including both aerodynamic and non-aerodynamic constraints. Here, NeuralFoil optimization is able to produce airfoils nearly identical in performance and shape to expert-designed airfoils within seconds; these computationally-optimized airfoils provide a useful starting point for further expert refinement.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we establish tight lower bounds for Byzantine-robust distributed first-order stochastic optimization methods in both strongly convex and non-convex stochastic optimization. We reveal that when the distributed nodes have heterogeneous data, the convergence error comprises two components: a non-vanishing Byzantine error and a vanishing optimization error. We establish the lower bounds on the Byzantine error and on the minimum number of queries to a stochastic gradient oracle required to achieve an arbitrarily small optimization error. Nevertheless, we identify significant discrepancies between our established lower bounds and the existing upper bounds. To fill this gap, we leverage the techniques of Nesterov's acceleration and variance reduction to develop novel Byzantine-robust distributed stochastic optimization methods that provably match these lower bounds, up to logarithmic factors, implying that our established lower bounds are tight.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunzhi Yao, Jizhan Fang, Jia-Chen Gu, Ningyu Zhang, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen, Nanyun Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Bhowmick, Harsh Wadhwa, Avinash Singh, Tania Sidana, Quoc Hoan Tran, Krishna Kumar Sabapathy</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum computers offer a promising route to tackling problems that are classically intractable such as in prime-factorization, solving large-scale linear algebra and simulating complex quantum systems, but require fault-tolerant quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to provide a near-term route to quantum utility or advantage, and is usually constructed by using parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) in combination with a classical optimizer for training. Although VQAs have been proposed for a multitude of tasks such as ground-state estimation, combinatorial optimization and unitary compilation, there remain major challenges in its trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra Supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training schemes that combine an existing g-sim method (that uses the underlying group structure of the operators) and the Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically test our proposal for ground-state estimation using Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and classification of quantum phases using quantum neural networks. Our methods show better accuracy and success of trials, and also need fewer calls to the quantum hardware on an average than using only PSR (upto 60% reduction), that runs exclusively on quantum hardware. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming (DIDP) is a state-space search paradigm based on dynamic programming for combinatorial optimization. In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamish Flynn, Julia Olkhovskaya, Paul Rognon-Vael</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of simultaneously learning relevant features and minimising regret in contextual bandit problems. We introduce and analyse a new class of contextual bandit problems, called sparse nonparametric contextual bandits, in which the expected reward function lies in the linear span of a small unknown set of features that belongs to a known infinite set of candidate features. We consider two notions of sparsity, for which the set of candidate features is either countable or uncountable. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we provide lower bounds on the minimax regret, which show that polynomial dependence on the number of actions is generally unavoidable in this setting. Second, we show that a variant of the Feel-Good Thompson Sampling algorithm enjoys regret bounds that match our lower bounds up to logarithmic factors of the horizon, and have logarithmic dependence on the effective number of candidate features. When we apply our results to kernelised and neural contextual bandits, we find that sparsity always enables better regret bounds, as long as the horizon is large enough relative to the sparsity and the number of actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wa\"iss Azizian, Franck Iutzeler, J\'er\^ome Malick, Panayotis Mertikopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we examine the time it takes for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to reach the global minimum of a general, non-convex loss function. We approach this question through the lens of randomly perturbed dynamical systems and large deviations theory, and we provide a tight characterization of the global convergence time of SGD via matching upper and lower bounds. These bounds are dominated by the most "costly" set of obstacles that the algorithm may need to overcome to reach a global minimizer from a given initialization, coupling in this way the global geometry of the underlying loss landscape with the statistics of the noise entering the process. Finally, motivated by applications to the training of deep neural networks, we also provide a series of refinements and extensions of our analysis for loss functions with shallow local minima.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Sun, Han Wang, Dongbai Li, Gang Wang, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/BDC_mitigation_assessment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Designing effective embodied multi-agent systems is critical for solving complex real-world tasks across domains. Due to the complexity of multi-agent embodied systems, existing methods fail to automatically generate safe and efficient training data for such systems. To this end, we propose the concept of compositional constraints for embodied multi-agent systems, addressing the challenges arising from collaboration among embodied agents. We design various interfaces tailored to different types of constraints, enabling seamless interaction with the physical world. Leveraging compositional constraints and specifically designed interfaces, we develop an automated data collection framework for embodied multi-agent systems and introduce the first benchmark for embodied multi-agent manipulation, RoboFactory. Based on RoboFactory benchmark, we adapt and evaluate the method of imitation learning and analyzed its performance in different difficulty agent tasks. Furthermore, we explore the architectures and training strategies for multi-agent imitation learning, aiming to build safe and efficient embodied multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ananta R. Bhattarai, Xingzhe He, Alla Sheffer, Helge Rhodin</p>
<p>Abstract: DreamFusion established a new paradigm for unsupervised 3D reconstruction from virtual views by combining advances in generative models and differentiable rendering. However, the underlying multi-view rendering, along with supervision from large-scale generative models, is computationally expensive and under-constrained. We propose DreamTexture, a novel Shape-from-Virtual-Texture approach that leverages monocular depth cues to reconstruct 3D objects. Our method textures an input image by aligning a virtual texture with the real depth cues in the input, exploiting the inherent understanding of monocular geometry encoded in modern diffusion models. We then reconstruct depth from the virtual texture deformation with a new conformal map optimization, which alleviates memory-intensive volumetric representations. Our experiments reveal that generative models possess an understanding of monocular shape cues, which can be extracted by augmenting and aligning texture cues -- a novel monocular reconstruction paradigm that we call Analysis by Augmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of LLM-based agents represents a paradigm shift in AI, enabling autonomous systems to plan, reason, use tools, and maintain memory while interacting with dynamic environments. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of evaluation methodologies for these increasingly capable agents. We systematically analyze evaluation benchmarks and frameworks across four critical dimensions: (1) fundamental agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, self-reflection, and memory; (2) application-specific benchmarks for web, software engineering, scientific, and conversational agents; (3) benchmarks for generalist agents; and (4) frameworks for evaluating agents. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including a shift toward more realistic, challenging evaluations with continuously updated benchmarks. We also identify critical gaps that future research must address-particularly in assessing cost-efficiency, safety, and robustness, and in developing fine-grained, and scalable evaluation methods. This survey maps the rapidly evolving landscape of agent evaluation, reveals the emerging trends in the field, identifies current limitations, and proposes directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liming Jiang, Qing Yan, Yumin Jia, Zichuan Liu, Hao Kang, Xin Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Quanhao Li, Zhen Xing, Rui Wang, Hui Zhang, Qi Dai, Zuxuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics. Our project page are publicly available at https://quanhaol.github.io/magicmotion-site.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ron Campos, Ashmal Vayani, Parth Parag Kulkarni, Rohit Gupta, Aritra Dutta, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Image geolocalization, in which, traditionally, an AI model predicts the precise GPS coordinates of an image is a challenging task with many downstream applications. However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their knowledge other than the GPS coordinate; the model lacks an understanding of the location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user. In recent days, with tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs) proprietary and open-source researchers have attempted to geolocalize images via LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for more specialized downstream tasks, one of which is geolocalization, LMMs struggle. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by introducing a conversational model GAEA that can provide information regarding the location of an image, as required by a user. No large-scale dataset enabling the training of such a model exists. Thus we propose a comprehensive dataset GAEA with 800K images and around 1.6M question answer pairs constructed by leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. For quantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark comprising 4K image-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with diverse question types. We consider 11 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LMMs and demonstrate that GAEA significantly outperforms the best open-source model, LLaVA-OneVision by 25.69% and the best proprietary model, GPT-4o by 8.28%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumyajit Guin, Shalabh Bhatnagar</p>
<p>Abstract: The infinite horizon setting is widely adopted for problems of reinforcement learning (RL). These invariably result in stationary policies that are optimal. In many situations, finite horizon control problems are of interest and for such problems, the optimal policies are time-varying in general. Another setting that has become popular in recent times is of Constrained Reinforcement Learning, where the agent maximizes its rewards while it also aims to satisfy some given constraint criteria. However, this setting has only been studied in the context of infinite horizon MDPs where stationary policies are optimal. We present an algorithm for constrained RL in the Finite Horizon Setting where the horizon terminates after a fixed (finite) time. We use function approximation in our algorithm which is essential when the state and action spaces are large or continuous and use the policy gradient method to find the optimal policy. The optimal policy that we obtain depends on the stage and so is non-stationary in general. To the best of our knowledge, our paper presents the first policy gradient algorithm for the finite horizon setting with constraints. We show the convergence of our algorithm to a constrained optimal policy. We also compare and analyze the performance of our algorithm through experiments and show that our algorithm performs better than some other well known algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaime S. Cardoso, Ricardo Cruz, Tom\'e Albuquerque</p>
<p>Abstract: In many real-world prediction tasks, class labels contain information about the relative order between labels that are not captured by commonly used loss functions such as multicategory cross-entropy. Recently, the preference for unimodal distributions in the output space has been incorporated into models and loss functions to account for such ordering information. However, current approaches rely on heuristics that lack a theoretical foundation. Here, we propose two new approaches to incorporate the preference for unimodal distributions into the predictive model. We analyse the set of unimodal distributions in the probability simplex and establish fundamental properties. We then propose a new architecture that imposes unimodal distributions and a new loss term that relies on the notion of projection in a set to promote unimodality. Experiments show the new architecture achieves top-2 performance, while the proposed new loss term is very competitive while maintaining high unimodality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bruno Machado Pacheco, Laio Oriel Seman, Cezar Antonio Rigo, Eduardo Camponogara, Eduardo Augusto Bezerra, Leandro dos Santos Coelho</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates how to schedule nanosatellite tasks more efficiently using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eilam Shapira, Omer Madmon, Reut Apel, Moshe Tennenholtz, Roi Reichart</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in designing LLM-based agents for tasks that involve interaction with human and artificial agents. This paper addresses a key aspect in the design of such agents: predicting human decisions in off-policy evaluation (OPE). We focus on language-based persuasion games, where an expert aims to influence the decision-maker through verbal messages. In our OPE framework, the prediction model is trained on human interaction data collected from encounters with one set of expert agents, and its performance is evaluated on interactions with a different set of experts. Using a dedicated application, we collected a dataset of 87K decisions from humans playing a repeated decision-making game with artificial agents. To enhance off-policy performance, we propose a simulation technique involving interactions across the entire agent space and simulated decision-makers. Our learning strategy yields significant OPE gains, e.g., improving prediction accuracy in the top 15% challenging cases by 7.1%. Our code and the large dataset we collected and generated are submitted as supplementary material and publicly available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/eilamshapira/HumanChoicePrediction</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of black-box models has become not just a legal requirement, but also an additional way to assess their performance. However, the state of the art post-hoc explanation approaches for regression models rely on synthetic data generation, which introduces uncertainty and can hurt the reliability of the explanations. Furthermore, they tend to produce explanations that apply to only very few data points. In this paper, we present BELLA, a deterministic model-agnostic post-hoc approach for explaining the individual predictions of regression black-box models. BELLA provides explanations in the form of a linear model trained in the feature space. BELLA maximizes the size of the neighborhood to which the linear model applies so that the explanations are accurate, simple, general, and robust. BELLA can produce both factual and counterfactual explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Preference-based feedback is important for many applications in machine learning where evaluation of a reward function is not feasible. Notable recent examples arise in preference alignment for large language models, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). For many applications of preference alignment, the cost of acquiring human feedback can be substantial. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that one can often choose contexts at which to obtain human feedback to most efficiently identify a good policy, and formalize the setting as an active contextual dueling bandit problem. We propose an active exploration algorithm to efficiently select the data and provide theoretical proof that it has a polynomial worst-case regret bound. We extend the setting and methodology for practical use in preference alignment of large language models. We provide two extensions, an online and an offline approach. Our method outperforms the baselines with limited samples of human preferences on several language models and four real-world datasets including two new datasets that we contribute to the literature.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dehua Peng, Zhipeng Gui, Huayi Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The characteristics of data like distribution and heterogeneity, become more complex and counterintuitive as dimensionality increases. This phenomenon is known as curse of dimensionality, where common patterns and relationships (e.g., internal pattern and boundary pattern) that hold in low-dimensional space may be invalid in higher-dimensional space. It leads to a decreasing performance for the regression, classification, or clustering models or algorithms. Curse of dimensionality can be attributed to many causes. In this paper, we first summarize the potential challenges associated with manipulating high-dimensional data, and explains the possible causes for the failure of regression, classification, or clustering tasks. Subsequently, we delve into two major causes of the curse of dimensionality, distance concentration, and manifold effect, by performing theoretical and empirical analyses. The results demonstrate that, as the dimensionality increases, nearest neighbor search (NNS) using three classical distance measurements, Minkowski distance, Chebyshev distance, and cosine distance, becomes meaningless. Meanwhile, the data incorporates more redundant features, and the variance contribution of principal component analysis (PCA) is skewed towards a few dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunju Kim, Dongman Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid advancement of ubiquitous computing technology, human activity analysis based on time series data from a diverse range of sensors enables the delivery of more intelligent services. Despite the importance of exploring new activities in real-world scenarios, existing human activity recognition studies generally rely on predefined known activities and often overlook detecting new patterns (novelties) that have not been previously observed during training. Novelty detection in human activities becomes even more challenging due to (1) diversity of patterns within the same known activity, (2) shared patterns between known and new activities, and (3) differences in sensor properties of each activity dataset. We introduce CLAN, a two-tower model that leverages Contrastive Learning with diverse data Augmentation for New activity detection in sensor-based environments. CLAN simultaneously and explicitly utilizes multiple types of strongly shifted data as negative samples in contrastive learning, effectively learning invariant representations that adapt to various pattern variations within the same activity. To enhance the ability to distinguish between known and new activities that share common features, CLAN incorporates both time and frequency domains, enabling the learning of multi-faceted discriminative representations. Additionally, we design an automatic selection mechanism of data augmentation methods tailored to each dataset's properties, generating appropriate positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CLAN achieves a 9.24% improvement in AUROC compared to the best-performing baseline model.</p>

We first investigate the generalization phase transition as data size increases, comparing experimental results with information-theory-based approximations. We find generalization in a Goldilocks zone where the decoder is neither too weak nor too powerful. We then introduce an effective theory for the dynamics of representation learning, where latent-space representations are modeled as interacting particles (repons), and find that it explains our experimentally observed phase transition between generalization and overfitting as encoder and decoder learning rates are scanned. This highlights the power of physics-inspired effective theories for bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and practice in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parshin Shojaee, Kazem Meidani, Shashank Gupta, Amir Barati Farimani, Chandan K Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical equations have been unreasonably effective in describing complex natural phenomena across various scientific disciplines. However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely large combinatorial hypothesis spaces. Current methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression techniques, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. They also employ limited representations such as expression trees, constraining the search space and expressiveness of equations. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its domain knowledge, which are then optimized against data to estimate parameters. We evaluate LLM-SR on four benchmark problems across diverse scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology), which we carefully designed to simulate the discovery process and prevent LLM recitation. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR discovers physically accurate equations that significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic regression baselines, particularly in out-of-domain test settings. We also show that LLM-SR's incorporation of scientific priors enables more efficient equation space exploration than the baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Shee, Anton Morgunov, Haote Li, Victor S. Batista</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) methods rely on iterative single-step predictions, leading to exponential search space growth that limits efficiency and scalability. We introduce a series of transformer-based models, that leverage a mixture of experts approach to directly generate multistep synthetic routes as a single string, conditionally predicting each transformation based on all preceding ones. Our DMS Explorer XL model, which requires only target compounds as input, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the PaRoutes dataset with 1.9x and 3.1x improvements in Top-1 accuracy on the n$_1$ and n$_5$ test sets, respectively. Providing additional information, such as the desired number of steps and starting materials, enables both a reduction in model size and an increase in accuracy, highlighting the benefits of incorporating more constraints into the prediction process. The top-performing DMS-Flex (Duo) model scores 25-50% higher on Top-1 and Top-10 accuracies for both n$_1$ and n$_5$ sets. Additionally, our models successfully predict routes for FDA-approved drugs not included in the training data, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. While the limited diversity of the training set may affect performance on less common reaction types, our multistep-first approach presents a promising direction towards fully automated retrosynthetic planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Sahin Tas, Royden Wagner</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based models generate hidden states that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we analyze hidden states and modify them at inference, with a focus on motion forecasting. We use linear probing to analyze whether interpretable features are embedded in hidden states. Our experiments reveal high probing accuracy, indicating latent space regularities with functionally important directions. Building on this, we use the directions between hidden states with opposing features to fit control vectors. At inference, we add our control vectors to hidden states and evaluate their impact on predictions. Remarkably, such modifications preserve the feasibility of predictions. We further refine our control vectors using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). This leads to more linear changes in predictions when scaling control vectors. Our approach enables mechanistic interpretation as well as zero-shot generalization to unseen dataset characteristics with negligible computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqiang Cai, Gaohang Chen, Zhonghua Qiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The universal approximation property is fundamental to the success of neural networks, and has traditionally been achieved by training networks without any constraints on their parameters. However, recent experimental research proposed a novel permutation-based training method, which exhibited a desired classification performance without modifying the exact weight values. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of this permutation training method by proving its ability to guide a ReLU network to approximate one-dimensional continuous functions. Our numerical results further validate this method's efficiency in regression tasks with various initializations. The notable observations during weight permutation suggest that permutation training can provide an innovative tool for describing network learning behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuorui Ye, Stephanie Milani, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Fei Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have predominantly leveraged neural network policies for decision-making, yet these models often lack interpretability, posing challenges for stakeholder comprehension and trust. Concept bottleneck models offer an interpretable alternative by integrating human-understandable concepts into policies. However, prior work assumes that concept annotations are readily available during training. For RL, this requirement poses a significant limitation: it necessitates continuous real-time concept annotation, which either places an impractical burden on human annotators or incurs substantial costs in API queries and inference time when employing automated labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel training scheme that enables RL agents to efficiently learn a concept-based policy by only querying annotators to label a small set of data. Our algorithm, LICORICE, involves three main contributions: interleaving concept learning and RL training, using an ensemble to actively select informative data points for labeling, and decorrelating the concept data. We show how LICORICE reduces human labeling efforts to 500 or fewer concept labels in three environments, and 5000 or fewer in two more complex environments, all at no cost to performance. We also explore the use of VLMs as automated concept annotators, finding them effective in some cases but imperfect in others. Our work significantly reduces the annotation burden for interpretable RL, making it more practical for real-world applications that necessitate transparency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Guo, Wei Chen, Yuxuan Sun, Bo Ai, Nikolaos Pappas, Tony Quek</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have been extensively utilized in AI-generated content (AIGC) in recent years, thanks to the superior generation capabilities. Combining with semantic communications, diffusion models are used for tasks such as denoising, data reconstruction, and content generation. However, existing diffusion-based generative models do not consider the stringent bandwidth limitation, which limits its application in wireless communication. This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-level metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and semantic metrics like learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). These enhancements are more profound regarding the compression rates and SNR compared to deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC).</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose Wolf, a WOrLd summarization Framework for accurate video captioning. Wolf is an automated captioning framework that adopts a mixture-of-experts approach, leveraging complementary strengths of Vision Language Models (VLMs). By utilizing both image and video models, our framework captures different levels of information and summarizes them efficiently. Our approach can be applied to enhance video understanding, auto-labeling, and captioning. To evaluate caption quality, we introduce CapScore, an LLM-based metric to assess the similarity and quality of generated captions compared to the ground truth captions. We further build four human-annotated datasets in three domains: autonomous driving, general scenes, and robotics, to facilitate comprehensive comparisons. We show that Wolf achieves superior captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches from the research community (VILA1.5, CogAgent) and commercial solutions (Gemini-Pro-1.5, GPT-4V). For instance, in comparison with GPT-4V, Wolf improves CapScore both quality-wise by 55.6% and similarity-wise by 77.4% on challenging driving videos. Finally, we establish a benchmark for video captioning and introduce a leaderboard, aiming to accelerate advancements in video understanding, captioning, and data alignment.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Makarov, Santhanakrishnan Narayanan, Constantinos Antoniou</p>
<p>Abstract: As urban environments grow, the modelling of transportation systems becomes increasingly complex. This paper advances the field of travel demand modelling by introducing advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures as surrogate models, addressing key limitations of previous approaches. Building on prior work with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), we introduce GATv3, a new Graph Attention Network (GAT) variant that mitigates over-smoothing through residual connections, enabling deeper and more expressive architectures. Additionally, we propose a fine-grained classification framework that improves predictive stability while achieving numerical precision comparable to regression, offering a more interpretable and efficient alternative. To enhance model performance, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy, which expands the augmented training dataset without overfitting. Our experiments demonstrate that GATv3 significantly improves classification performance, while the GCN model shows unexpected dominance in fine-grained classification when supplemented with additional training data. The results highlight the advantages of fine-grained classification over regression for travel demand modelling tasks and reveal new challenges in extending GAT-based architectures to complex transport scenarios. Notably, GATv3 appears well-suited for classification-based transportation applications, such as section control and congestion warning systems, which require a higher degree of differentiation among neighboring links. These findings contribute to refining GNN-based surrogates, offering new possibilities for applying GATv3 and fine-grained classification in broader transportation challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Banayeeanzade, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi, Mohammad Rostami</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to improve the generalization performance of a model on multiple related tasks by training it simultaneously on those tasks. Unlike MTL, where the model has instant access to the training data of all tasks, continual learning (CL) involves adapting to new sequentially arriving tasks over time without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Despite the wide practical adoption of CL and MTL and extensive literature on both areas, there remains a gap in the theoretical understanding of these methods when used with overparameterized models such as deep neural networks. This paper studies the overparameterized linear models as a proxy for more complex models. We develop theoretical results describing the effect of various system parameters on the model's performance in an MTL setup. Specifically, we study the impact of model size, dataset size, and task similarity on the generalization error and knowledge transfer. Additionally, we present theoretical results to characterize the performance of replay-based CL models. Our results reveal the impact of buffer size and model capacity on the forgetting rate in a CL setup and help shed light on some of the state-of-the-art CL methods. Finally, through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are also applicable to deep neural networks, offering valuable guidance for designing MTL and CL models in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Li, Qihang Lin, Ayush Ghosh, Tianbao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The post-processing approaches are becoming prominent techniques to enhance machine learning models' fairness because of their intuitiveness, low computational cost, and excellent scalability. However, most existing post-processing methods are designed for task-specific fairness measures and are limited to single-output models. In this paper, we introduce a post-processing method for multi-output models, such as the ones used for multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning, to enhance a model's distributional parity, a task-agnostic fairness measure. Existing methods for achieving distributional parity rely on the (inverse) cumulative density function of a model's output, restricting their applicability to single-output models. Extending previous works, we propose to employ optimal transport mappings to move a model's outputs across different groups towards their empirical Wasserstein barycenter. An approximation technique is applied to reduce the complexity of computing the exact barycenter and a kernel regression method is proposed to extend this process to out-of-sample data. Our empirical studies evaluate the proposed approach against various baselines on multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizhe Fan, Quanjun Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for preserving graph topology when mapping nodes to vector representations, enabling various downstream tasks such as node classification and community detection. However, most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge, researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising, existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and 81.6% respectively. Visualizations further show tighter intra-cluster aggregation and clearer inter-cluster boundaries, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework in improving upon baseline GCL models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxing Li, Zihan Chen, Kai Fong Ernest Chong, Bikramjit Das, Tony Q. S. Quek, Howard H. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging over-the-air computations for model aggregation is an effective approach to cope with the communication bottleneck in federated edge learning. By exploiting the superposition properties of multi-access channels, this approach facilitates an integrated design of communication and computation, thereby enhancing system privacy while reducing implementation costs. However, the inherent electromagnetic interference in radio channels often exhibits heavy-tailed distributions, giving rise to exceptionally strong noise in globally aggregated gradients that can significantly deteriorate the training performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient clipping method, termed Median Anchored Clipping (MAC), to combat the detrimental effects of heavy-tailed noise. We also derive analytical expressions for the convergence rate of model training with analog over-the-air federated learning under MAC, which quantitatively demonstrates the effect of MAC on training performance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAC algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of heavy-tailed noise, hence substantially enhancing system robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruining Yang, Yi Xu, Yun Fu, Lili Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. In addition, the imbalanced distribution of driving scenarios often biases models toward data-rich cases, limiting performance in safety-critical, data-scarce conditions. To address these challenges, we propose the Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction (SSTP) framework, which constructs a compact yet balanced dataset for trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages (1) Extraction, in which a pretrained trajectory prediction model computes gradient vectors for each sample to capture their influence on parameter updates; and (2) Selection, where a submodular function is applied to greedily choose a representative subset that covers diverse driving scenarios. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy and even improving in high-density cases. We evaluate our proposed SSTP on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmarks using a wide range of recent state-of-the-art models. Our experiments demonstrate that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Importantly, SSTP exhibits strong generalization and robustness, and the selected subset is model-agnostic, offering a broadly applicable solution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Yu, Virginie Do, Karen Hambardzumyan, Nicola Cancedda</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can elicit harmful responses. Defending against such attacks remains challenging due to the opacity of jailbreaking mechanisms and the high computational cost of training LLMs robustly. We demonstrate that adversarial attacks share a universal mechanism for circumventing LLM safeguards that works by ablating a dimension in the residual stream embedding space called the refusal feature. We further show that the operation of refusal feature ablation (RFA) approximates the worst-case perturbation of offsetting model safety. Based on these findings, we propose Refusal Feature Adversarial Training (ReFAT), a novel algorithm that efficiently performs LLM adversarial training by simulating the effect of input-level attacks via RFA. Experiment results show that ReFAT significantly improves the robustness of three popular LLMs against a wide range of adversarial attacks, with considerably less computational overhead compared to existing adversarial training methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Policy evaluation estimates the performance of a policy by (1) collecting data from the environment and (2) processing raw data into a meaningful estimate. Due to the sequential nature of reinforcement learning, any improper data-collecting policy or data-processing method substantially deteriorates the variance of evaluation results over long time steps. Thus, policy evaluation often suffers from large variance and requires massive data to achieve the desired accuracy. In this work, we design an optimal combination of data-collecting policy and data-processing baseline. Theoretically, we prove our doubly optimal policy evaluation method is unbiased and guaranteed to have lower variance than previously best-performing methods. Empirically, compared with previous works, we show our method reduces variance substantially and achieves superior empirical performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emam Hossain, Md Osman Gani, Devon Dunmire, Aneesh Subramanian, Hammad Younas</p>
<p>Abstract: The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has emerged as a significant contributor to global sea level rise, primarily due to increased meltwater runoff. Supraglacial lakes, which form on the ice sheet surface during the summer months, can impact ice sheet dynamics and mass loss; thus, better understanding these lakes' seasonal evolution and dynamics is an important task. This study presents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to identify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that refreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt season, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few meters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible radiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model, trained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy with Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This performance significantly surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning models which require a large training data. The results demonstrate the robustness of the RPS-GMM model in capturing the complex temporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes with minimal training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Claire Chen, Shuze Daniel Liu, Shangtong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, classic on-policy evaluation methods often suffer from high variance and require massive online data to attain the desired accuracy. Previous studies attempt to reduce evaluation variance by searching for or designing proper behavior policies to collect data. However, these approaches ignore the safety of such behavior policies -- the designed behavior policies have no safety guarantee and may lead to severe damage during online executions. In this paper, to address the challenge of reducing variance while ensuring safety simultaneously, we propose an optimal variance-minimizing behavior policy under safety constraints. Theoretically, while ensuring safety constraints, our evaluation method is unbiased and has lower variance than on-policy evaluation. Empirically, our method is the only existing method to achieve both substantial variance reduction and safety constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we show our method is even superior to previous methods in both variance reduction and execution safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zirui Zhao, Hanze Dong, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucinations (i.e., generating plausible but inaccurate content) and laziness (i.e. excessive refusals or defaulting to "I don't know") persist as major challenges in LLM reasoning. Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate "I don't know" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness.

<p>Abstract: Line graph transformation has been widely studied in graph theory, where each node in a line graph corresponds to an edge in the original graph. This has inspired a series of graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to transformed line graphs, which have proven effective in various graph representation learning tasks. However, there is limited theoretical study on how line graph transformation affects the expressivity of GNN models. In this study, we focus on two types of graphs known to be challenging to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests: Cai-F\"urer-Immerman (CFI) graphs and strongly regular graphs, and show that applying line graph transformation helps exclude these challenging graph properties, thus potentially assist WL tests in distinguishing these graphs. We empirically validate our findings by conducting a series of experiments that compare the accuracy and efficiency of graph isomorphism tests and GNNs on both line-transformed and original graphs across these graph structure types.</p>

<p>Abstract: As diffusion models become increasingly popular, the misuse of copyrighted and private images has emerged as a major concern. One promising solution to mitigate this issue is identifying the contribution of specific training samples in generative models, a process known as data attribution. Existing data attribution methods for diffusion models typically quantify the contribution of a training sample by evaluating the change in diffusion loss when the sample is included or excluded from the training process. However, we argue that the direct usage of diffusion loss cannot represent such a contribution accurately due to the calculation of diffusion loss. Specifically, these approaches measure the divergence between predicted and ground truth distributions, which leads to an indirect comparison between the predicted distributions and cannot represent the variances between model behaviors. To address these issues, we aim to measure the direct comparison between predicted distributions with an attribution score to analyse the training sample importance, which is achieved by Diffusion Attribution Score (\textit{DAS}). Underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, we elucidate the effectiveness of DAS. Additionally, we explore strategies to accelerate DAS calculations, facilitating its application to large-scale diffusion models. Our extensive experiments across various datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that DAS significantly surpasses previous benchmarks in terms of the linear data-modelling score, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Zhang, Boyang Qiang, Xiaoyu Guo, Weiwei Xing, Yue Cheng, Witold Pedrycz</p>
<p>Abstract: Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jamie Hayes, Marika Swanberg, Harsh Chaudhari, Itay Yona, Ilia Shumailov, Milad Nasr, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Katherine Lee, A. Feder Cooper</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to memorizing training data, raising concerns about the potential extraction of sensitive information at generation time. Discoverable extraction is the most common method for measuring this issue: split a training example into a prefix and suffix, then prompt the LLM with the prefix, and deem the example extractable if the LLM generates the matching suffix using greedy sampling. This definition yields a yes-or-no determination of whether extraction was successful with respect to a single query. Though efficient to compute, we show that this definition is unreliable because it does not account for non-determinism present in more realistic (non-greedy) sampling schemes, for which LLMs produce a range of outputs for the same prompt. We introduce probabilistic discoverable extraction, which, without additional cost, relaxes discoverable extraction by considering multiple queries to quantify the probability of extracting a target sequence. We evaluate our probabilistic measure across different models, sampling schemes, and training-data repetitions, and find that this measure provides more nuanced information about extraction risk compared to traditional discoverable extraction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) non-invasively measures signals generated by muscle activity with sufficient sensitivity to detect individual spinal neurons and richness to identify dozens of gestures and their nuances. Wearable wrist-based sEMG sensors have the potential to offer low friction, subtle, information rich, always available human-computer inputs. To this end, we introduce emg2qwerty, a large-scale dataset of non-invasive electromyographic signals recorded at the wrists while touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard, together with ground-truth annotations and reproducible baselines. With 1,135 sessions spanning 108 users and 346 hours of recording, this is the largest such public dataset to date. These data demonstrate non-trivial, but well defined hierarchical relationships both in terms of the generative process, from neurons to muscles and muscle combinations, as well as in terms of domain shift across users and user sessions. Applying standard modeling techniques from the closely related field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), we show strong baseline performance on predicting key-presses using sEMG signals alone. We believe the richness of this task and dataset will facilitate progress in several problems of interest to both the machine learning and neuroscientific communities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathan Pirnay, Jan G. Rittig, Alexander B. Wolf, Martin Grohe, Jakob Burger, Alexander Mitsos, Dominik G. Grimm</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative deep learning has become pivotal in molecular design for drug discovery, materials science, and chemical engineering. A widely used paradigm is to pretrain neural networks on string representations of molecules and fine-tune them using reinforcement learning on specific objectives. However, string-based models face challenges in ensuring chemical validity and enforcing structural constraints like the presence of specific substructures. We propose to instead combine graph-based molecular representations, which can naturally ensure chemical validity, with transformer architectures, which are highly expressive and capable of modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Our approach iteratively modifies a molecular graph by adding atoms and bonds, which ensures chemical validity and facilitates the incorporation of structural constraints. We present GraphXForm, a decoder-only graph transformer architecture, which is pretrained on existing compounds and then fine-tuned using a new training algorithm that combines elements of the deep cross-entropy method and self-improvement learning. We evaluate GraphXForm on various drug design tasks, demonstrating superior objective scores compared to state-of-the-art molecular design approaches. Furthermore, we apply GraphXForm to two solvent design tasks for liquid-liquid extraction, again outperforming alternative methods while flexibly enforcing structural constraints or initiating design from existing molecular structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Rifat Arefin, Gopeshh Subbaraj, Nicolas Gontier, Yann LeCun, Irina Rish, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Christopher Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Decoder-only Transformers often struggle with complex reasoning tasks, particularly arithmetic reasoning requiring multiple sequential operations. In this work, we identify representation collapse in the model's intermediate layers as a key factor limiting their reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose Sequential Variance-Covariance Regularization (Seq-VCR), which enhances the entropy of intermediate representations and prevents collapse. Combined with dummy pause tokens as substitutes for chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens, our method significantly improves performance in arithmetic reasoning problems. In the challenging $5 \times 5$ integer multiplication task, our approach achieves $99.5\%$ exact match accuracy, outperforming models of the same size (which yield $0\%$ accuracy) and GPT-4 with five-shot CoT prompting ($44\%$). We also demonstrate superior results on arithmetic expression and longest increasing subsequence (LIS) datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of preventing intermediate layer representation collapse to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Transformers and show that Seq-VCR offers an effective solution without requiring explicit CoT supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sizai Hou, Songze Li, Duanyi Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is pervasively exploited in training high-quality upstream encoders with a large amount of unlabeled data. However, it is found to be susceptible to backdoor attacks merely via polluting a small portion of training data. The victim encoders associate triggered inputs with target embeddings, e.g., mapping a triggered cat image to an airplane embedding, such that the downstream tasks inherit unintended behaviors when the trigger is activated. Emerging backdoor attacks have shown great threats across different SSL paradigms such as contrastive learning and CLIP, yet limited research is devoted to defending against such attacks, and existing defenses fall short in detecting advanced stealthy backdoors. To address the limitations, we propose a novel detection mechanism, DeDe, which detects the activation of backdoor mappings caused by triggered inputs on victim encoders. Specifically, DeDe trains a decoder for any given SSL encoder using an auxiliary dataset (which can be out-of-distribution or even slightly poisoned), so that for any triggered input that misleads the encoder into the target embedding, the decoder generates an output image significantly different from the input. DeDe leverages the discrepancy between the input and the decoded output to identify potential backdoor misbehavior during inference. We empirically evaluate DeDe on both contrastive learning and CLIP models against various types of backdoor attacks. Our results demonstrate promising detection effectiveness over various advanced attacks and superior performance compared over state-of-the-art detection methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer remarkable capabilities, yet their high inference costs restrict wider adoption. While increasing parameter counts improves accuracy, it also broadens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a hardware-aware framework that accelerates the inference of LLMs while preserving their capabilities. Using neural architecture search (NAS) at a large-scale, Puzzle optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization.
  We showcase our framework's impact via Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B), a publicly available model derived from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Nemotron-51B achieves a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while retaining 98.4% of the original model's benchmark accuracies. Notably, it is the most accurate model supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite training on only 45B tokens, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B. Lastly, we derive Llama-3.3-Nemotron-49B-Super-Base to demonstrate Puzzle can retain long-context and that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them to surpass the parent model in specific capabilities. Our work establishes that powerful LLM models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible loss in quality, underscoring that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key challenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation learning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL). Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fermin Orozco, Pedro Porto Buarque de Gusm\~ao, Hongkai Wen, Johan Wahlstr\"om, Man Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep-learning based traffic prediction models require vast amounts of data to learn embedded spatial and temporal dependencies. The inherent privacy and commercial sensitivity of such data has encouraged a shift towards decentralised data-driven methods, such as Federated Learning (FL). Under a traditional Machine Learning paradigm, traffic flow prediction models can capture spatial and temporal relationships within centralised data. In reality, traffic data is likely distributed across separate data silos owned by multiple stakeholders. In this work, a cross-silo FL setting is motivated to facilitate stakeholder collaboration for optimal traffic flow prediction applications. This work introduces an FL framework, referred to as FedTPS, to generate synthetic data to augment each client's local dataset by training a diffusion-based trajectory generation model through FL. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large-scale real world ride-sharing dataset using various FL methods and Traffic Flow Prediction models, including a novel prediction model we introduce, which leverages Temporal and Graph Attention mechanisms to learn the Spatio-Temporal dependencies embedded within regional traffic flow data. Experimental results show that FedTPS outperforms multiple other FL baselines with respect to global model performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/lazydit</p>

<p>Abstract: Reservoir Computing was shown in recent years to be useful as efficient to learn networks in the field of time series tasks. Their randomized initialization, a computational benefit, results in drawbacks in theoretical analysis of large random graphs, because of which deterministic variations are an still open field of research. Building upon Next-Gen Reservoir Computing and the Temporal Convolution Derived Reservoir Computing, we propose a deterministic alternative to the higher-dimensional mapping therein, TCRC-LM and TCRC-CM, utilizing the parametrized but deterministic Logistic mapping and Chebyshev maps. To further enhance the predictive capabilities in the task of time series forecasting, we propose the novel utilization of the Lobachevsky function as non-linear activation function.
  As a result, we observe a new, fully deterministic network being able to outperform TCRCs and classical Reservoir Computing in the form of the prominent Echo State Networks by up to $99.99\%$ for the non-chaotic time series and $87.13\%$ for the chaotic ones.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning and scratchpads have emerged as critical tools for enhancing the computational capabilities of transformers. While theoretical results show that polynomial-length scratchpads can extend transformers' expressivity from $TC^0$ to $PTIME$, their required length remains poorly understood. Empirical evidence even suggests that transformers need scratchpads even for many problems in $TC^0$, such as Parity or Multiplication, challenging optimistic bounds derived from circuit complexity. In this work, we initiate the study of systematic lower bounds for the number of CoT steps across different algorithmic problems, in the hard-attention regime. We study a variety of algorithmic problems, and provide bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. Overall, these results contribute to emerging understanding of the power and limitations of chain-of-thought reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minxiao Chen, Haitao Yuan, Nan Jiang, Zhihan Zheng, Sai Wu, Ao Zhou, Shangguang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Online map matching is a fundamental problem in location-based services, aiming to incrementally match trajectory data step-by-step onto a road network. However, existing methods fail to meet the needs for efficiency, robustness, and accuracy required by large-scale online applications, making this task still challenging. This paper introduces a novel framework that achieves high accuracy and efficient matching while ensuring robustness in handling diverse scenarios. To improve efficiency, we begin by modeling the online map matching problem as an Online Markov Decision Process (OMDP) based on its inherent characteristics. This approach helps efficiently merge historical and real-time data, reducing unnecessary calculations. Next, to enhance robustness, we design a reinforcement learning method, enabling robust handling of real-time data from dynamically changing environments. In particular, we propose a novel model learning process and a comprehensive reward function, allowing the model to make reasonable current matches from a future-oriented perspective, and to continuously update and optimize during the decision-making process based on feedback. Lastly, to address the heterogeneity between trajectories and roads, we design distinct graph structures, facilitating efficient representation learning through graph and recurrent neural networks. To further align trajectory and road data, we introduce contrastive learning to decrease their distance in the latent space, thereby promoting effective integration of the two. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jake Vasilakes, Chrysoula Zerva, Sophia Ananiadou</p>
<p>Abstract: Many existing approaches for learning from labeled data assume the existence of gold-standard labels. According to these approaches, inter-annotator disagreement is seen as noise to be removed, either through refinement of annotation guidelines, label adjudication, or label filtering. However, annotator disagreement can rarely be totally eradicated, especially on more subjective tasks such as sentiment analysis or hate speech detection where disagreement is natural. Therefore, a new approach to learning from labeled data, called data perspectivism, seeks to leverage inter-annotator disagreement to learn models that stay true to the inherent uncertainty of the task by treating annotations as opinions of the annotators, rather than gold-standard facts. Despite this conceptual grounding, existing methods under data perspectivism are limited to using disagreement as the sole source of annotation uncertainty. To expand the possibilities of data perspectivism, we introduce Subjective Logic Encodings (SLEs), a flexible framework for constructing classification targets that explicitly encodes annotations as opinions of the annotators. Based on Subjective Logic Theory, SLEs encode labels as Dirichlet distributions and provide principled methods for encoding and aggregating various types of annotation uncertainty -- annotator confidence, reliability, and disagreement -- into the targets. We show that SLEs are a generalization of other types of label encodings as well as how to estimate models to predict SLEs using a distribution matching objective.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we focus on using RL in container shipping, often considered the cornerstone of global trade, by dealing with the critical challenge of master stowage planning. The main objective is to maximize cargo revenue and minimize operational costs while navigating demand uncertainty and various complex operational constraints, namely vessel capacity and stability, which must be dynamically updated along the vessel's voyage. To address this problem, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework with feasibility projection to solve the master stowage planning problem (MPP) under demand uncertainty. The experimental results show that our architecture efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions for this multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, outperforming traditional mixed-integer programming and RL with feasibility regularization. Our AI-driven decision-support policy enables adaptive and feasible planning under uncertainty, optimizing operational efficiency and capacity utilization while contributing to sustainable and resilient global supply chains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph fraud detection (GFD) has rapidly advanced in protecting online services by identifying malicious fraudsters. Recent supervised GFD research highlights that heterophilic connections between fraudsters and users can greatly impact detection performance, since fraudsters tend to camouflage themselves by building more connections to benign users. Despite the promising performance of supervised GFD methods, the reliance on labels limits their applications to unsupervised scenarios; Additionally, accurately capturing complex and diverse heterophily patterns without labels poses a further challenge. To fill the gap, we propose a Heterophily-guided Unsupervised Graph fraud dEtection approach (HUGE) for unsupervised GFD, which contains two essential components: a heterophily estimation module and an alignment-based fraud detection module. In the heterophily estimation module, we design a novel label-free heterophily metric called HALO, which captures the critical graph properties for GFD, enabling its outstanding ability to estimate heterophily from node attributes. In the alignment-based fraud detection module, we develop a joint MLP-GNN architecture with ranking loss and asymmetric alignment loss. The ranking loss aligns the predicted fraud score with the relative order of HALO, providing an extra robustness guarantee by comparing heterophily among non-adjacent nodes. Moreover, the asymmetric alignment loss effectively utilizes structural information while alleviating the feature-smooth effects of GNNs. Extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate that HUGE significantly outperforms competitors, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: For pre-training of MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) models, one of the main issues is unbalanced expert loads, which may cause routing collapse or increased computational overhead. Existing methods contain the Loss-Controlled method and the Loss-Free method, where both the unbalanced degrees at first several training steps are still high and decrease slowly. In this work, we propose BIP-Based Balancing, an expert load balancing algorithm based on binary integer programming (BIP). The algorithm maintains an additional vector q on each MoE layer that can help change the top-K order of s by solving a binary integer programming with very small time costs. We implement the algorithm on two MoE language models: 16-expert (0.3B) and 64-expert (1.1B). The experimental results show that on both models comparing with the Loss-Controlled method and the Loss-Free method, our algorithm trains models with the lowest perplexities, while saves at least 13% of pre-training time compared with the Loss-Controlled method. Within our current knowledge, this is the first routing algorithm that achieves maintaining load balance status on every expert in every MoE layer from the first step to the last step during the whole pre-training process, while the trained MoE models also perform well.

Despite its promise, existing methodologies predominantly rely on probabilistic models and focus narrowly on task objectives, overlooking the nuanced challenges posed by epistemic uncertainty, non-probabilistic modelling approaches, and the integration of uncertainty into optimisation constraints. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing innovative frameworks: (i) a non-probabilistic lens for epistemic uncertainty representation, leveraging intervals (the least informative uncertainty model), Contamination (hybrid model), and probability boxes (the most informative uncertainty model); (ii) methodologies to incorporate uncertainty into constraints, expanding Decision-Focused Learning's utility in constrained environments; (iii) the adoption of Imprecise Decision Theory for ambiguity-rich decision-making contexts; and (iv) strategies for addressing sparse data challenges. Empirical evaluations on benchmark optimisation problems demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches in improving decision quality and robustness and dealing with said gaps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maher Hanut, Jonathan Kadmon</p>
<p>Abstract: Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang YuHang, Junkang Guo, Aolei Liu, Kaihao Wang, Zaitong Wu, Zhenyu Liu, Wenfei Yin, Jian Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial robustness is a critical challenge in deploying deep neural networks for real-world applications. While adversarial training is a widely recognized defense strategy, most existing studies focus on balanced datasets, overlooking the prevalence of long-tailed distributions in real-world data, which significantly complicates robustness. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of adversarial training under long-tailed distributions and identifies limitations in the current state-of-the-art method, AT-BSL, in achieving robust performance under such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework, TAET, which integrates an initial stabilization phase followed by a stratified equalization adversarial training phase. Additionally, prior work on long-tailed robustness has largely ignored the crucial evaluation metric of balanced accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of balanced robustness, a comprehensive metric tailored for assessing robustness under long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing advanced defenses, achieving significant improvements in both memory and computational efficiency. This work represents a substantial advancement in addressing robustness challenges in real-world applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongyuan Yang, Siqi Peng, Akihiro Yamamoto</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel and efficient method for link prediction in bipartite networks, using \textit{formal concept analysis} (FCA) and the Transformer encoder. Link prediction in bipartite networks finds practical applications in various domains such as product recommendation in online sales, and prediction of chemical-disease interaction in medical science. Since for link prediction, the topological structure of a network contains valuable information, many approaches focus on extracting structural features and then utilizing them for link prediction. Bi-cliques, as a type of structural feature of bipartite graphs, can be utilized for link prediction. Although several link prediction methods utilizing bi-cliques have been proposed and perform well in rather small datasets, all of them face challenges with scalability when dealing with large datasets since they demand substantial computational resources. This limits the practical utility of these approaches in real-world applications. To overcome the limitation, we introduce a novel approach employing iceberg concept lattices and the Transformer encoder. Our method requires fewer computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale datasets while maintaining high prediction performance. We conduct experiments on five large real-world datasets that exceed the capacity of previous bi-clique-based approaches to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Additionally, we perform supplementary experiments on five small datasets to compare with the previous bi-clique-based methods for bipartite link prediction and demonstrate that our method is more efficient than the previous ones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Dai, Peilin Chen, Malinda Lu, Daniel Li, Haowen Wei, Hejie Cui, Paul Pu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrzej Cichocki, Toshihisa Tanaka, Sergio Cruces</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose and investigate a wide class of Mirror Descent updates (MD) and associated novel Generalized Exponentiated Gradient (GEG) algorithms by exploiting various trace-form entropies and associated deformed logarithms and their inverses - deformed (generalized) exponential functions. The proposed algorithms can be considered as extension of entropic MD and generalization of multiplicative updates. In the literature, there exist nowadays over fifty mathematically well defined generalized entropies, so impossible to exploit all of them in one research paper. So we focus on a few selected most popular entropies and associated logarithms like the Tsallis, Kaniadakis and Sharma-Taneja-Mittal and some of their extension like Tempesta or Kaniadakis-Scarfone entropies. The shape and properties of the deformed logarithms and their inverses are tuned by one or more hyperparameters. By learning these hyperparameters, we can adapt to distribution of training data, which can be designed to the specific geometry of the optimization problem, leading to potentially faster convergence and better performance. The using generalized entropies and associated deformed logarithms in the Bregman divergence, used as a regularization term, provides some new insight into exponentiated gradient descent updates.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we will establish that the Langevin Monte-Carlo algorithm can learn depth-2 neural nets of any size and for any data and we give non-asymptotic convergence rates for it. We achieve this via showing that under Total Variation distance and q-Renyi divergence, the iterates of Langevin Monte Carlo converge to the Gibbs distribution of Frobenius norm regularized losses for any of these nets, when using smooth activations and in both classification and regression settings. Most critically, the amount of regularization needed for our results is independent of the size of the net. This result combines several recent observations, like our previous papers showing that two-layer neural loss functions can always be regularized by a certain constant amount such that they satisfy the Villani conditions, and thus their Gibbs measures satisfy a Poincare inequality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viet-Hoang Tran, Thanh T. Chu, Khoi N. M. Nguyen, Trang Pham, Tam Le, Tan M. Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (OT) simplifies the OT problem in high-dimensional spaces by projecting supports of input measures onto one-dimensional lines and then exploiting the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden of OT. Recently, the Tree-Sliced method has been introduced to replace these lines with more intricate structures, known as tree systems. This approach enhances the ability to capture topological information of integration domains in Sliced OT while maintaining low computational cost. Inspired by this approach, in this paper, we present an adaptation of tree systems on OT problems for measures supported on a sphere. As a counterpart to the Radon transform variant on tree systems, we propose a novel spherical Radon transform with a new integration domain called spherical trees. By leveraging this transform and exploiting the spherical tree structures, we derive closed-form expressions for OT problems on the sphere. Consequently, we obtain an efficient metric for measures on the sphere, named Spherical Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (STSW) distance. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to demonstrate the topology of spherical trees and the well-definedness and injectivity of our Radon transform variant, which leads to an orthogonally invariant distance between spherical measures. Finally, we conduct a wide range of numerical experiments, including gradient flows and self-supervised learning, to assess the performance of our proposed metric, comparing it to recent benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyu Liang, Dongrui Cai, Chenyuan Zhang, Zheng Liang, Chen Liang, Bo Zheng, Shi Qiu, Jin Wang, Hongzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Model selection has been raised as an essential problem in the area of time series anomaly detection (TSAD), because there is no single best TSAD model for the highly heterogeneous time series in real-world applications. However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungwon Seo, Ferhat Ozgur Catak, Chunming Rong, Kibeom Hong, Minhoe Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving multi-source information fusion (MSIF) but is challenged by client drift in highly heterogeneous data settings. Many existing drift-mitigation strategies rely on reference-based techniques--such as gradient adjustments or proximal loss--that use historical snapshots (e.g., past gradients or previous global models) as reference points. When only a subset of clients participates in each training round, these historical references may not accurately capture the overall data distribution, leading to unstable training. In contrast, our proposed Gradient Centralized Federated Learning (GC-Fed) employs a hyperplane as a historically independent reference point to guide local training and enhance inter-client alignment. GC-Fed comprises two complementary components: Local GC, which centralizes gradients during local training, and Global GC, which centralizes updates during server aggregation. In our hybrid design, Local GC is applied to feature-extraction layers to harmonize client contributions, while Global GC refines classifier layers to stabilize round-wise performance. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on benchmark FL tasks demonstrate that GC-Fed effectively mitigates client drift and achieves up to a 20% improvement in accuracy under heterogeneous and partial participation conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Zhang, Peijun Xiao, Ruoyu Sun, Zhi-Quan Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Nonconvex-concave min-max problem arises in many machine learning applications including minimizing a pointwise maximum of a set of nonconvex functions and robust adversarial training of neural networks. A popular approach to solve this problem is the gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm which unfortunately can exhibit oscillation in case of nonconvexity. In this paper, we introduce a "smoothing" scheme which can be combined with GDA to stabilize the oscillation and ensure convergence to a stationary solution. We prove that the stabilized GDA algorithm can achieve an $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity for minimizing the pointwise maximum of a finite collection of nonconvex functions. Moreover, the smoothed GDA algorithm achieves an $O(1/\epsilon^4)$ iteration complexity for general nonconvex-concave problems. Extensions of this stabilized GDA algorithm to multi-block cases are presented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to achieve $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for a class of nonconvex-concave problem. We illustrate the practical efficiency of the stabilized GDA algorithm on robust training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julio Enrique Castrillon-Candas, Dingning Liu, Sicheng Yang, Xiaoling Zhang, Mark Kon</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we develop a Multilevel Orthogonal Subspace (MOS) Karhunen-Loeve feature theory based on stochastic tensor spaces, for the construction of robust machine learning features. Training data is treated as instances of a random field within a relevant Bochner space. Our key observation is that separate machine learning classes can reside predominantly in mostly distinct subspaces. Using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion and a hierarchical expansion of the first (nominal) class, a MOS is constructed to detect anomalous signal components, treating the second class as an outlier of the first. The projection coefficients of the input data into these subspaces are then used to train a Machine Learning (ML) classifier. These coefficients become new features from which much clearer separation surfaces can arise for the underlying classes. Tests in the blood plasma dataset (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) show dramatic increases in accuracy. This is in contrast to popular ML methods such as Gradient Boosting, RUS Boost, Random Forest and (Convolutional) Neural Networks.</p>

Current state of the art (and standard clinical practice) requires expensive, manual expert analysis, whereas our pipeline takes only 15 seconds per metaphase image. Using a novel pretraining-finetuning strategy to mitigate the challenge of data scarcity, we achieve a high precision-recall score of 94% AUC for the clinically significant del(5q) and t(9;22) anomalies. Our method also unlocks zero-shot detection of rare aberrations based on model latent embeddings. The ability to quickly, accurately, and scalably diagnose genetic abnormalities directly from metaphase images could transform karyotyping practice and improve patient outcomes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniele Zambon, Cesare Alippi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joao F. Doriguello, Alessandro Luongo, Ewin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Clustering is one of the most important tools for analysis of large datasets, and perhaps the most popular clustering algorithm is Lloyd's iteration for $k$-means. This iteration takes $n$ vectors $V=[v_1,\dots,v_n]\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and outputs $k$ centroids $c_1,\dots,c_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$; these partition the vectors into clusters based on which centroid is closest to a particular vector. We present an overall improved version of the "$q$-means" algorithm, the quantum algorithm originally proposed by Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash (NeurIPS'19) which performs $\varepsilon$-$k$-means, an approximate version of $k$-means clustering. Our algorithm does not rely on quantum linear algebra primitives of prior work, but instead only uses QRAM to prepare simple states based on the current iteration's clusters and multivariate quantum amplitude estimation. The time complexity is $\widetilde{O}\big(\frac{\|V\|_F}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{k^{5/2}d}{\varepsilon}(\sqrt{k} + \log{n})\big)$ and maintains the logarithmic dependence on $n$ while improving the dependence on most of the other parameters. We also present a "dequantized" algorithm for $\varepsilon$-$k$-means which runs in $O\big(\frac{\|V\|_F^2}{n}\frac{k^{2}}{\varepsilon^2}(kd + \log{n})\big)$ time. Notably, this classical algorithm matches the logarithmic dependence on $n$ attained by the quantum algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenyu Wang, Peter B\"uhlmann, Zijian Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Empirical risk minimization often performs poorly when the distribution of the target domain differs from those of source domains. To address such potential distribution shifts, we develop an unsupervised domain adaptation approach that leverages labeled data from multiple source domains and unlabeled data from the target domain. We introduce a distributionally robust model that optimizes an adversarial reward based on the explained variance across a class of target distributions, ensuring generalization to the target domain. We show that the proposed robust model is a weighted average of conditional outcome models from source domains. This formulation allows us to compute the robust model through the aggregation of source models, which can be estimated using various machine learning algorithms of the users' choice, such as random forests, boosting, and neural networks. Additionally, we introduce a bias-correction step to obtain a more accurate aggregation weight, which is effective for various machine learning algorithms. Our framework can be interpreted as a distributionally robust federated learning approach that satisfies privacy constraints while providing insights into the importance of each source for prediction on the target domain. The performance of our method is evaluated on both simulated and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonid Ugadiarov, Vitaliy Vorobyov, Aleksandr I. Panov</p>
<p>Abstract: The advances in unsupervised object-centric representation learning have significantly improved its application to downstream tasks. Recent works highlight that disentangled object representations can aid policy learning in image-based, object-centric reinforcement learning tasks. This paper proposes a novel object-centric reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates actor-critic and model-based approaches by incorporating an object-centric world model within the critic. The world model captures the environment's data-generating process by predicting the next state and reward given the current state-action pair, where actions are interventions in the environment. In model-based reinforcement learning, world model learning can be interpreted as a causal induction problem, where the agent must learn the causal relationships underlying the environment's dynamics. We evaluate our method in a simulated 3D robotic environment and a 2D environment with compositional structure. As baselines, we compare against object-centric, model-free actor-critic algorithms and a state-of-the-art monolithic model-based algorithm. While the baselines show comparable performance in easier tasks, our approach outperforms them in more challenging scenarios with a large number of objects or more complex dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ritesh Chandra, Sadhana Tiwari, Satyam Rastogi, Sonali Agarwal</p>
<p>Abstract: Liver diseases pose a significant global health burden, impacting many individuals and having substantial economic and social consequences. Rising liver problems are considered a fatal disease in many countries, such as Egypt and Moldova. This study aims to develop a diagnosis and treatment model for liver disease using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Patient Clinical Data (PCD) ontology, and detection rules derived from a decision tree algorithm. For the development of the ontology, the National Viral Hepatitis Control Program (NVHCP) guidelines were used, which made the ontology more accurate and reliable. The Apache Jena framework uses batch processing to detect events based on these rules. Based on the event detected, queries can be directly processed using SPARQL. We convert these Decision Tree (DT) and medical guidelines-based rules into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to operationalize the ontology. Using this SWRL in the ontology to predict different types of liver disease with the help of the Pellet and Drools inference engines in Protege Tools, a total of 615 records were taken from different liver diseases. After inferring the rules, the result can be generated for the patient according to the rules, and other patient-related details, along with different precautionary suggestions, can be obtained based on these results. These rules can make suggestions more accurate with the help of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) with open API-based suggestions. When the patient has prescribed a medical test, the model accommodates this result using optical character recognition (OCR), and the same process applies when the patient has prescribed a further medical suggestion according to the test report. These models combine to form a comprehensive Decision Support System (DSS) for the diagnosis of liver disease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joao F. Doriguello, Debbie Lim, Chi Seng Pun, Patrick Rebentrost, Tushar Vaidya</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel quantum high-dimensional linear regression algorithm with an $\ell_1$-penalty based on the classical LARS (Least Angle Regression) pathwise algorithm. Similarly to available classical algorithms for Lasso, our quantum algorithm provides the full regularisation path as the penalty term varies, but quadratically faster per iteration under specific conditions. A quadratic speedup on the number of features $d$ is possible by using the simple quantum minimum-finding subroutine from D\"urr and Hoyer (arXiv'96) in order to obtain the joining time at each iteration. We then improve upon this simple quantum algorithm and obtain a quadratic speedup both in the number of features $d$ and the number of observations $n$ by using the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine from Chen and de Wolf (ICALP'23). In order to do so, we approximately compute the joining times to be searched over by the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine. As another main contribution, we prove, via an approximate version of the KKT conditions and a duality gap, that the LARS algorithm (and therefore our quantum algorithm) is robust to errors. This means that it still outputs a path that minimises the Lasso cost function up to a small error if the joining times are only approximately computed. Furthermore, we show that, when the observations are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, our quantum algorithm's complexity only depends polylogarithmically on $n$, exponentially better than the classical LARS algorithm, while keeping the quadratic improvement on $d$. Moreover, we propose a dequantised version of our quantum algorithm that also retains the polylogarithmic dependence on $n$, albeit presenting the linear scaling on $d$ from the standard LARS algorithm. Finally, we prove query lower bounds for classical and quantum Lasso algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Chhan, Ellen Novoseller, Vernon J. Lawhern</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) provides a framework to train AI agents using human feedback through preferences over pairs of behaviors, enabling agents to learn desired behaviors when it is difficult to specify a numerical reward function. While this paradigm leverages human feedback, it typically treats the feedback as given by a single human user. However, different users may desire multiple AI behaviors and modes of interaction. Meanwhile, incorporating preference feedback from crowds (i.e. ensembles of users) in a robust manner remains a challenge, and the problem of training RL agents using feedback from multiple human users remains understudied. In this work, we introduce a conceptual framework, Crowd-PrefRL, that integrates preference-based RL approaches with techniques from unsupervised crowdsourcing to enable training of autonomous system behaviors from crowdsourced feedback. We show preliminary results suggesting that Crowd-PrefRL can learn reward functions and agent policies from preference feedback provided by crowds of unknown expertise and reliability. We also show that in most cases, agents trained with Crowd-PrefRL outperform agents trained with majority-vote preferences or preferences from any individual user, especially when the spread of user error rates among the crowd is large. Results further suggest that our method can identify the presence of minority viewpoints within the crowd in an unsupervised manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cangqing Wang, Jiangchuan Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: This study endeavors to conceptualize and execute a sophisticated agricultural greenhouse control system grounded in the amalgamation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. Through meticulous monitoring of intrinsic environmental parameters within the greenhouse and the integration of machine learning algorithms, the conditions within the greenhouse are aptly modulated. The envisaged outcome is an enhancement in crop growth efficiency and yield, accompanied by a reduction in resource wastage. In the backdrop of escalating global population figures and the escalating exigencies of climate change, agriculture confronts unprecedented challenges. Conventional agricultural paradigms have proven inadequate in addressing the imperatives of food safety and production efficiency. Against this backdrop, greenhouse agriculture emerges as a viable solution, proffering a controlled milieu for crop cultivation to augment yields, refine quality, and diminish reliance on natural resources [b1]. Nevertheless, greenhouse agriculture contends with a gamut of challenges. Traditional greenhouse management strategies, often grounded in experiential knowledge and predefined rules, lack targeted personalized regulation, thereby resulting in resource inefficiencies. The exigencies of real-time monitoring and precise control of the greenhouse's internal environment gain paramount importance with the burgeoning scale of agriculture. To redress this challenge, the study introduces IoT technology and machine learning algorithms into greenhouse agriculture, aspiring to institute an intelligent agricultural greenhouse control system conducive to augmenting the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmay Vilas Samak, Tanmay Vilas Samak, Venkat Narayan Krovi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for cyber-physical vehicle systems usually requires a significantly long training time due to their inherent complexity. Furthermore, deploying the trained policies in the real world demands a feature-rich environment along with multiple physical embodied agents, which may not be feasible due to monetary, physical, energy, or safety constraints. This work seeks to address these pain points by presenting a mixed-reality digital twin framework capable of: (i) selectively scaling parallelized workloads on-demand, and (ii) evaluating the trained policies across simulation-to-reality (sim2real) experiments. The viability and performance of the proposed framework are highlighted through two representative use cases, which cover cooperative as well as competitive classes of MARL problems. We study the effect of: (i) agent and environment parallelization on training time, and (ii) systematic domain randomization on zero-shot sim2real transfer across both case studies. Results indicate up to 76.3% reduction in training time with the proposed parallelization scheme and sim2real gap as low as 2.9% using the proposed deployment method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiasheng Ye, Peiju Liu, Tianxiang Sun, Jun Zhan, Yunhua Zhou, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pretraining data of large language models composes multiple domains (e.g., web texts, academic papers, codes), whose mixture proportions crucially impact the competence of outcome models. While existing endeavors rely on heuristics or qualitative strategies to tune the proportions, we discover the quantitative predictability of model performance regarding the mixture proportions in function forms, which we refer to as the data mixing laws. Fitting such functions on sample mixtures unveils model performance on unseen mixtures before actual runs, thus guiding the selection of an ideal data mixture. Furthermore, we propose nested use of the scaling laws of training steps, model sizes, and our data mixing law to enable predicting the performance of large models trained on massive data under various mixtures with only small-scale training. Moreover, experimental results verify that our method effectively optimizes the training mixture of a 1B model trained for 100B tokens in RedPajama, reaching a performance comparable to the one trained for 48% more steps on the default mixture. Extending the application of data mixing laws to continual training accurately predicts the critical mixture proportion that avoids catastrophic forgetting and outlooks the potential for dynamic data schedules</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyungjun Yoon, Jaehyun Kwak, Biniyam Aschalew Tolera, Gaole Dai, Mo Li, Taesik Gong, Kimin Lee, Sung-Ju Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a method for utilizing massive unlabeled data for pre-training models, providing an effective feature extractor for various mobile sensing applications. However, when deployed to end-users, these models encounter significant domain shifts attributed to user diversity. We investigate the performance degradation that occurs when self-supervised models are fine-tuned in heterogeneous domains. To address the issue, we propose SelfReplay, a few-shot domain adaptation framework for personalizing self-supervised models. SelfReplay proposes self-supervised meta-learning for initial model pre-training, followed by a user-side model adaptation by replaying the self-supervision with user-specific data. This allows models to adjust their pre-trained representations to the user with only a few samples. Evaluation with four benchmarks demonstrates that SelfReplay outperforms existing baselines by an average F1-score of 8.8%p. Our on-device computational overhead analysis on a commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphone shows that SelfReplay completes adaptation within an unobtrusive latency (in three minutes) with only a 9.54% memory consumption, demonstrating the computational efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Landolsi, Fredrik Kahl</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot learning deals with problems such as image classification using very few training examples. Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data. We expand on this line of research by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. We also present a theoretical analysis on how the accuracy estimator variance depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. Finally, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms training on real data mined from the dataset used in the original diffusion model training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lijie Hu, Tianhao Huang, Huanyi Xie, Xilin Gong, Chenyang Ren, Zhengyu Hu, Lu Yu, Ping Ma, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to provide concept-based explanations for black-box deep learning models while achieving high final prediction accuracy using human-like concepts. However, the training of current CBMs is heavily dependent on the precision and richness of the annotated concepts in the dataset. These concept labels are typically provided by experts, which can be costly and require significant resources and effort. Additionally, concept saliency maps frequently misalign with input saliency maps, causing concept predictions to correspond to irrelevant input features - an issue related to annotation alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework called SSCBM (Semi-supervised Concept Bottleneck Model). Our SSCBM is suitable for practical situations where annotated data is scarce. By leveraging joint training on both labeled and unlabeled data and aligning the unlabeled data at the concept level, we effectively solve these issues. We proposed a strategy to generate pseudo labels and an alignment loss. Experiments demonstrate that our SSCBM is both effective and efficient. With only 10% labeled data, our model's concept and task accuracy on average across four datasets is only 2.44% and 3.93% lower, respectively, compared to the best baseline in the fully supervised learning setting.</p>

To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios</p>

<p>Abstract: Years of study of the propagation channel showed a close relation between a location and the associated communication channel response. The use of a neural network to learn the location-to-channel mapping can therefore be envisioned. The Implicit Neural Representation (INR) literature showed that classical neural architecture are biased towards learning low-frequency content, making the location-to-channel mapping learning a non-trivial problem. Indeed, it is well known that this mapping is a function rapidly varying with the location, on the order of the wavelength. This paper leverages the model-based machine learning paradigm to derive a problem-specific neural architecture from a propagation channel model. The resulting architecture efficiently overcomes the spectral-bias issue. It only learns low-frequency sparse correction terms activating a dictionary of high-frequency components. The proposed architecture is evaluated against classical INR architectures on realistic synthetic data, showing much better accuracy. Its mapping learning performance is explained based on the approximated channel model, highlighting the explainability of the model-based machine learning paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanqiao Qu, Qiyuan Chen, Wei Wei, Zheng Lin, Xianhao Chen, Kaibin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device large language models (LLMs), referring to running LLMs on edge devices, have raised considerable interest since they are more cost-effective, latency-efficient, and privacy-preserving compared with the cloud paradigm. Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We begin by illustrating several killer applications to demonstrate the urgent need for deploying LLMs at the network edge. Next, we present the preliminaries of LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM), outlining its core components and how it supports the deployment of LLMs. Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities. We hope this article inspires researchers in the field to leverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and delay-sensitive applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep supervised learning models require high volume of labeled data to attain sufficiently good results. Although, the practice of gathering and annotating such big data is costly and laborious. Recently, the application of self supervised learning (SSL) in vision tasks has gained significant attention. The intuition behind SSL is to exploit the synchronous relationships within the data as a form of self-supervision, which can be versatile. In the current big data era, most of the data is unlabeled, and the success of SSL thus relies in finding ways to utilize this vast amount of unlabeled data available. Thus it is better for deep learning algorithms to reduce reliance on human supervision and instead focus on self-supervision based on the inherent relationships within the data. With the advent of ViTs, which have achieved remarkable results in computer vision, it is crucial to explore and understand the various SSL mechanisms employed for training these models specifically in scenarios where there is limited labelled data available. In this survey, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of systematically classifying the SSL techniques based upon their representations and pre-training tasks being applied. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review popular pre-training tasks, and highlight the challenges and advancements in this field. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of different SSL methods, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and identify potential avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Bang Jiang, Yansen Wang, Bao-Liang Lu, Dongsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin L. Badger</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms that confer selective focus on a strict subset of input elements are nearly ubiquitous in language models today. We posit there to be downside to the use of attention: most input information is lost. In support of this idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers and more accurate representation in what we term masked mixers, which replace self-attention with masked convolutions. The masked mixer learns causal language modeling more efficiently than early transformer implementations and even outperforms optimized, current transformers when training on small ($n_{ctx}<512$) but not larger context windows. Evidence is presented for the hypothesis that differences in transformer and masked mixer training efficiencies for various tasks are best predicted by input representation accuracy, or equivalently global invertibility. We hypothesize that the information loss exhibited by transformers would be more detrimental to retrieval than generation, as the former is more closely approximated by a bijective and thus invertible function. We find that masked mixers are more effective retrieval models both when the pretrained embedding model is unchanged as well as when the embedding model is modified via cosine similarity-based InfoNCE loss minimization. A small masked mixer is shown to outperform a large and near state-of-the-art transformer-based retrieval model, despite the latter being trained with many orders of magnitude more data and compute.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although various visual localization approaches exist, such as scene coordinate regression and camera pose regression, these methods often struggle with optimization complexity or limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we explore the use of novel view synthesis techniques, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which enables the compact encoding of both 3D geometry and scene appearance. We propose a two-stage procedure that integrates dense and robust keypoint descriptors from the lightweight XFeat feature extractor into 3DGS, enhancing performance in both indoor and outdoor environments. The coarse pose estimates are directly obtained via 2D-3D correspondences between the 3DGS representation and query image descriptors. In the second stage, the initial pose estimate is refined by minimizing the rendering-based photometric warp loss. Benchmarking on widely used indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates improvements over recent neural rendering-based localization methods, such as NeRFMatch and PNeRFLoc.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management remain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing information to enrich the model's context-awareness. This approach allows MemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively than traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup tables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances performance in scenarios that demand structured memory management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Rivera Soto, Barry Chen, Nicholas Andrews</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality paraphrases are easy to produce using instruction-tuned language models or specialized paraphrasing models. Although this capability has a variety of benign applications, paraphrasing attacks$\unicode{x2013}$paraphrases applied to machine-generated texts$\unicode{x2013}$are known to significantly degrade the performance of machine-text detectors. This motivates us to consider the novel problem of paraphrase inversion, where, given paraphrased text, the objective is to recover an approximation of the original text. The closer the approximation is to the original text, the better machine-text detectors will perform. We propose an approach which frames the problem as translation from paraphrased text back to the original text, which requires examples of texts and corresponding paraphrases to train the inversion model. Fortunately, such training data can easily be generated, given a corpus of original texts and one or more paraphrasing models. We find that language models such as GPT-4 and Llama-3 exhibit biases when paraphrasing which an inversion model can learn with a modest amount of data. Perhaps surprisingly, we also find that such models generalize well, including to paraphrase models unseen at training time. Finally, we show that when combined with a paraphrased-text detector, our inversion models provide an effective defense against paraphrasing attacks, and overall our approach yields an average improvement of +22% AUROC across seven machine-text detectors and three different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijian Zhuo, Ya Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaoqing Li, Xun Zhou, Jinwen Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the $\textbf{optimal approximation rate}$, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhupender Singh, Ananth Ram Rajagopalan, Srikrishna Bhashyam</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I < d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.</p>

<p>Abstract: Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a common sensing problem in radar, sonar, audio, and wireless communication systems. It has gained renewed importance with the advent of the integrated sensing and communication paradigm. To fully exploit the potential of such sensing systems, it is crucial to take into account potential hardware impairments that can negatively impact the obtained performance. This study introduces a joint DoA estimation and hardware impairment learning scheme following a model-based approach. Specifically, a differentiable version of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is derived, allowing efficient learning of the considered impairments. The proposed approach supports both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, showcasing its practical potential. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method successfully learns significant inaccuracies in both antenna locations and complex gains. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms the classical MUSIC algorithm in the DoA estimation task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Noam Rotstein, Gal Yona, Daniel Silver, Roy Velich, David Bensa\"id, Ron Kimmel</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumya Suvra Ghosal, Souradip Chakraborty, Vaibhav Singh, Tianrui Guan, Mengdi Wang, Ahmad Beirami, Furong Huang, Alvaro Velasquez, Dinesh Manocha, Amrit Singh Bedi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for visual-reasoning tasks, improving their safety has become crucial. Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this work, we first highlight an important safety gap to describe that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model through controlled decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a mathematical characterization of Immune, offering insights on why it improves safety against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuangqi Li, Hieu Le, Jingyi Xu, Mathieu Salzmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating realistic images from arbitrary text prompts. However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tiantian Geng, Jinrui Zhang, Qingni Wang, Teng Wang, Jinming Duan, Feng Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daixuan Cheng, Shaohan Huang, Ziyu Zhu, Xintong Zhang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Zhongzhi Luan, Bo Dai, Zhenliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4V) in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Furthermore, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Ye, Xiaoxuan Ma, Hai Ci, Wentao Zhu, Yizhou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving realistic animated human avatars requires accurate modeling of pose-dependent clothing deformations. Existing learning-based methods heavily rely on the Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) of minimally-clothed human models like SMPL to model deformation. However, they struggle to handle loose clothing, such as long dresses, where the canonicalization process becomes ill-defined when the clothing is far from the body, leading to disjointed and fragmented results. To overcome this limitation, we propose FreeCloth, a novel hybrid framework to model challenging clothed humans. Our core idea is to use dedicated strategies to model different regions, depending on whether they are close to or distant from the body. Specifically, we segment the human body into three categories: unclothed, deformed, and generated. We simply replicate unclothed regions that require no deformation. For deformed regions close to the body, we leverage LBS to handle the deformation. As for the generated regions, which correspond to loose clothing areas, we introduce a novel free-form, part-aware generator to model them, as they are less affected by movements. This free-form generation paradigm brings enhanced flexibility and expressiveness to our hybrid framework, enabling it to capture the intricate geometric details of challenging loose clothing, such as skirts and dresses. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset featuring loose clothing demonstrate that FreeCloth achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior visual fidelity and realism, particularly in the most challenging cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Chen, Yuying Ge, Weiliang Tang, Yizhuo Li, Yixiao Ge, Mingyu Ding, Ying Shan, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Xu, Lingdong Kong, Hui Shuai, Liang Pan, Ziwei Liu, Qingshan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: LiDAR data pretraining offers a promising approach to leveraging large-scale, readily available datasets for enhanced data utilization. However, existing methods predominantly focus on sparse voxel representation, overlooking the complementary attributes provided by other LiDAR representations. In this work, we propose LiMoE, a framework that integrates the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm into LiDAR data representation learning to synergistically combine multiple representations, such as range images, sparse voxels, and raw points. Our approach consists of three stages: i) Image-to-LiDAR Pretraining, which transfers prior knowledge from images to point clouds across different representations; ii) Contrastive Mixture Learning (CML), which uses MoE to adaptively activate relevant attributes from each representation and distills these mixed features into a unified 3D network; iii) Semantic Mixture Supervision (SMS), which combines semantic logits from multiple representations to boost downstream segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across eleven large-scale LiDAR datasets demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority. The code has been made publicly accessible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anmol Goel, Yaxi Hu, Iryna Gurevych, Amartya Sanyal</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and away from undesirable behaviors (such as hallucination) has become increasingly important. Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation editing has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at inference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA) algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our PSA algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Nikulin, Ilya Zisman, Denis Tarasov, Nikita Lyubaykin, Andrei Polubarov, Igor Kiselev, Vladislav Kurenkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Xinyu Lu, Junjie Yang, Yanjiang Liu, Yaojie Lu, Debing Zhang, Xing Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI capabilities increasingly surpass human proficiency in complex tasks, current alignment techniques including SFT and RLHF face fundamental challenges in ensuring reliable oversight. These methods rely on direct human assessment and become untenable when AI outputs exceed human cognitive thresholds. In response to this challenge, we explore two hypotheses: (1) critique of critique can be easier than critique itself, extending the widely-accepted observation that verification is easier than generation to the critique domain, as critique itself is a specialized form of generation; (2) this difficulty relationship is recursively held, suggesting that when direct evaluation is infeasible, performing high-order critiques (e.g., critique of critique of critique) offers a more tractable supervision pathway. To examine these hypotheses, we perform Human-Human, Human-AI, and AI-AI experiments across multiple tasks. Our results demonstrate encouraging evidence supporting these hypotheses and suggest that recursive self-critiquing is a promising direction for scalable oversight.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling, enabling unprecedented realism in image and video synthesis. This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current unlearning methods for large language models usually rely on reverse optimization to reduce target token probabilities. However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves this essential capability.

<p>Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising domain to leverage the computational capabilities of quantum systems to solve complex classification tasks. In this work, we present the first comprehensive QML study by benchmarking the MedMNIST-a diverse collection of medical imaging datasets on a 127-qubit real IBM quantum hardware, to evaluate the feasibility and performance of quantum models (without any classical neural networks) in practical applications. This study explores recent advancements in quantum computing such as device-aware quantum circuits, error suppression, and mitigation for medical image classification. Our methodology is comprised of three stages: preprocessing, generation of noise-resilient and hardware-efficient quantum circuits, optimizing/training of quantum circuits on classical hardware, and inference on real IBM quantum hardware. Firstly, we process all input images in the preprocessing stage to reduce the spatial dimension due to quantum hardware limitations. We generate hardware-efficient quantum circuits using backend properties expressible to learn complex patterns for medical image classification. After classical optimization of QML models, we perform inference on real quantum hardware. We also incorporate advanced error suppression and mitigation techniques in our QML workflow, including dynamical decoupling (DD), gate twirling, and matrix-free measurement mitigation (M3) to mitigate the effects of noise and improve classification performance. The experimental results showcase the potential of quantum computing for medical imaging and establish a benchmark for future advancements in QML applied to healthcare.</p>

<p>Abstract: Two-sample hypothesis testing-determining whether two sets of data are drawn from the same distribution-is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning with broad scientific applications. In the context of nonparametric testing, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has gained popularity as a test statistic due to its flexibility and strong theoretical foundations. However, its use in large-scale scenarios is plagued by high computational costs. In this work, we use a Nystr\"om approximation of the MMD to design a computationally efficient and practical testing algorithm while preserving statistical guarantees. Our main result is a finite-sample bound on the power of the proposed test for distributions that are sufficiently separated with respect to the MMD. The derived separation rate matches the known minimax optimal rate in this setting. We support our findings with a series of numerical experiments, emphasizing realistic scientific data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milad Sefidgaran, Abdellatif Zaidi, Piotr Krasnowski</p>
<p>Abstract: We establish in-expectation and tail bounds on the generalization error of representation learning type algorithms. The bounds are in terms of the relative entropy between the distribution of the representations extracted from the training and "test'' datasets and a data-dependent symmetric prior, i.e., the Minimum Description Length (MDL) of the latent variables for the training and test datasets. Our bounds are shown to reflect the "structure" and "simplicity'' of the encoder and significantly improve upon the few existing ones for the studied model. We then use our in-expectation bound to devise a suitable data-dependent regularizer; and we investigate thoroughly the important question of the selection of the prior. We propose a systematic approach to simultaneously learning a data-dependent Gaussian mixture prior and using it as a regularizer. Interestingly, we show that a weighted attention mechanism emerges naturally in this procedure. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms the now popular Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) method as well as the recent Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB).</p>

<p>Abstract: Language models usually use left-to-right (L2R) autoregressive factorization. However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability and directional conditional entropy. We ablate the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyang Li, Zaishuo Xia, Lin Huang, Xinran Wei, Han Yang, Sam Harshe, Zun Wang, Chang Liu, Jia Zhang, Bin Shao, Mark B. Gerstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19537">No, of course I can! Refusal Mechanisms Can Be Exploited Using Harmless Fine-Tuning Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Kazdan, Lisa Yu, Rylan Schaeffer, Chris Cundy, Sanmi Koyejo, Krishnamurthy Dvijotham</p>
<p>Abstract: Leading language model (LM) providers like OpenAI and Google offer fine-tuning APIs that allow customers to adapt LMs for specific use cases. To prevent misuse, these LM providers implement filtering mechanisms to block harmful fine-tuning data. Consequently, adversaries seeking to produce unsafe LMs via these APIs must craft adversarial training data that are not identifiably harmful. We make three contributions in this context: 1. We show that many existing attacks that use harmless data to create unsafe LMs rely on eliminating model refusals in the first few tokens of their responses. 2. We show that such prior attacks can be blocked by a simple defense that pre-fills the first few tokens from an aligned model before letting the fine-tuned model fill in the rest. 3. We describe a new data-poisoning attack, ``No, Of course I Can Execute'' (NOICE), which exploits an LM's formulaic refusal mechanism to elicit harmful responses. By training an LM to refuse benign requests on the basis of safety before fulfilling those requests regardless, we are able to jailbreak several open-source models and a closed-source model (GPT-4o). We show an attack success rate (ASR) of 57% against GPT-4o; our attack earned a Bug Bounty from OpenAI. Against open-source models protected by simple defenses, we improve ASRs by an average of 3.25 times compared to the best performing previous attacks that use only harmless data. NOICE demonstrates the exploitability of repetitive refusal mechanisms and broadens understanding of the threats closed-source models face from harmless data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Cipriani, Alessandro De Santis, Giorgio Di Russo, Alfredo Grillo, Luca Tabarroni</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Dai, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07013">Learning Nash Equilibrial Hamiltonian for Two-Player Collision-Avoiding Interactions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Zhang, Siddharth Das, Tanner Merry, Wenlong Zhang, Yi Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Nash equilibrial policies for two-player risk-sensitive collision-avoiding interactions. Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations of such general-sum differential games in real time is an open challenge due to the discontinuity of equilibrium values on the state space. A common solution is to learn a neural network that approximates the equilibrium Hamiltonian for given system states and actions. The learning, however, is usually supervised and requires a large amount of sample equilibrium policies from different initial states in order to mitigate the risks of collisions. This paper claims two contributions towards more data-efficient learning of equilibrium policies: First, instead of computing Hamiltonian through a value network, we show that the equilibrium co-states have simple structures when collision avoidance dominates the agents' loss functions and system dynamics is linear, and therefore are more data-efficient to learn. Second, we introduce theory-driven active learning to guide data sampling, where the acquisition function measures the compliance of the predicted co-states to Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. On an uncontrolled intersection case, the proposed method leads to more generalizable approximation of the equilibrium policies, and in turn, lower collision probabilities, than the state-of-the-art under the same data acquisition budget.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250">Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaa-Yeon Lee, Byunghee Cha, Jeongsol Kim, Jong Chul Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08679">Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Iv\'an Arcuschin, Jett Janiak, Robert Krzyzanowski, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and ChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit biases in answers to binary questions ("implicit post-hoc rationalization"). For example, when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08738">Shedding Light in Task Decomposition in Program Synthesis: The Driving Force of the Synthesizer Model</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Janis Zenkner, Tobias Sesterhenn, Christian Bartelt</p>
<p>Abstract: Task decomposition is a fundamental mechanism in program synthesis, enabling complex problems to be broken down into manageable subtasks. ExeDec, a state-of-the-art program synthesis framework, employs this approach by combining a Subgoal Model for decomposition and a Synthesizer Model for program generation to facilitate compositional generalization. In this work, we develop REGISM, an adaptation of ExeDec that removes decomposition guidance and relies solely on iterative execution-driven synthesis. By comparing these two exemplary approaches-ExeDec, which leverages task decomposition, and REGISM, which does not-we investigate the interplay between task decomposition and program generation. Our findings indicate that ExeDec exhibits significant advantages in length generalization and concept composition tasks, likely due to its explicit decomposition strategies. At the same time, REGISM frequently matches or surpasses ExeDec's performance across various scenarios, with its solutions often aligning more closely with ground truth decompositions. These observations highlight the importance of repeated execution-guided synthesis in driving task-solving performance, even within frameworks that incorporate explicit decomposition strategies. Our analysis suggests that task decomposition approaches like ExeDec hold significant potential for advancing program synthesis, though further work is needed to clarify when and why these strategies are most effective.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: This study introduces a Vision-Language Model (VLM) leveraging SIGLIP and Gemma-3b architectures for automated acute tuberculosis (TB) screening. By integrating chest X-ray images and clinical notes, the model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings.
  Methods: The VLM combines visual data from chest X-rays with clinical context to generate detailed, context-aware diagnostic reports. The architecture employs SIGLIP for visual encoding and Gemma-3b for decoding, ensuring effective representation of acute TB-specific pathologies and clinical insights.
  Results: Key acute TB pathologies, including consolidation, cavities, and nodules, were detected with high precision (97percent) and recall (96percent). The model demonstrated strong spatial localization capabilities and robustness in distinguishing TB-positive cases, making it a reliable tool for acute TB diagnosis.
  Conclusion: The multimodal capability of the VLM reduces reliance on radiologists, providing a scalable solution for acute TB screening. Future work will focus on improving the detection of subtle pathologies and addressing dataset biases to enhance its generalizability and application in diverse global healthcare settings.</p>
