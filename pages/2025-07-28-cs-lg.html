<p><b>Authors:</b> Saeed Mohseni-Sehdeh, Walid Saad, Kei Sakaguchi, Tao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper, a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem, the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\) and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18668">Efficient Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Higher-Order Information in Integrated Graphs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghee Han, Daehee Kim, Minjun Lee, Daeyoung Roh, Keejun Han, Mun Yong Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1) Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets. Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64 specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99% performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements over 30%.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18680">Market Making Strategies with Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Oscar Fern\'andez Vicente</p>
<p>Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk, competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS, a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies, enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic trading in complex financial systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel de Sousa Ribeiro, Afonso Leote, Jo\~ao Leite</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing, additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models and datasets.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18725">The Right to be Forgotten in Pruning: Unveil Machine Unlearning on Sparse Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Xiao, Gen Li, Jie Ji, Ruimeng Ye, Xiaolong Ma, Bo Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology ``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18756">Exploitation Over Exploration: Unmasking the Bias in Linear Bandit Recommender Offline Evaluation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro R. Pires, Gregorio F. Azevedo, Pietro L. Campos, Rafael T. Sereicikas, Tiago A. Almeida</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings. Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender systems.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18794">CLEAR: Unlearning Spurious Style-Content Associations with Contrastive LEarning with Anti-contrastive Regularization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Sun, Benjamin A. Goldstein, Matthew M. Engelhard</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant) characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features, which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty, which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18804">Ralts: Robust Aggregation for Enhancing Graph Neural Network Resilience on Bit-flip Errors</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wencheng Zou, Nan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors. Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of $3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18807">Fishers for Free? Approximating the Fisher Information Matrix by Recycling the Squared Gradient Accumulator</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> YuXin Li, Felix Dangel, Derek Tam, Colin Raffel</p>
<p>Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal") has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically, the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training. This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide empirical quantification of their respective impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Bagatella, Mert Albaba, Jonas H\"ubotter, Georg Martius, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that performance can be substantially improved through test-time training, specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18811">Even Faster Simulations with Flow Matching: A Study of Zero Degree Calorimeter Responses</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maksymilian Wojnar</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching (FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18813">Scale-Consistent Learning for Partial Differential Equations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyi Li, Samuel Lanthaler, Catherine Deng, Michael Chen, Yixuan Wang, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Anima Anandkumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE. Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow, Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000, and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruimeng Ye, Zihan Wang, Xiao Yang, Zinan Ling, Manling Li, Bo Hui</p>
<p>Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments. Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents, we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis, we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18866">Early Mortality Prediction in ICU Patients with Hypertensive Kidney Disease Using Interpretable Machine Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Si, Junyi Fan, Li Sun, Shuheng Chen, Minoo Ahmadi, Elham Pishgar, Kamiar Alaei, Greg Placencia, Maryam Pishgar</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation; CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness, vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions: We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuefei Wu, Xiao Yin, Yuanyang Zhu, Chunlin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung Nguyen, Md Masud Rana, Farjana Tasnim Mukta, Chang-Guo Zhan, Duc Duy Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asaf Cohen, Onur G\"unl\"u</p>
<p>Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint. Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls. Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an $\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an $\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an $\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no information on the best arm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vidhi Oad, Param Pathak, Nouhaila Innan, Shalini D, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes (KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism, enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware, transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> HMNS Kumari, HMLS Kumari, UMMPK Nawarathne</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially, 11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481. To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy 0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxence Bouvier, Ryan Amaudruz, Felix Arnold, Renzo Andri, Lukas Cavigelli</p>
<p>Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model, GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions. Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model. Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18% switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for digital systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jongsoo Lee, Jangwon Kim, Jiseok Jeong, Soohee Han</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent. This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Behraj Khan, Tahir Qasim Syed, Nouman Muhammad Durrani</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face \textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE (Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry, guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision, language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness across modalities and shift intensities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gihun Kim, Sun-Yong Choi, Yeoneung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laingjun Feng, Chenyi Pan, Xinjie Guo, Fei Mei, Benzhe Ning, Jianxiang Zhang, Xinyang Liu, Beirong Zhou, Zeng Shu, Chang Liu, Guang Yang, Zhenyu Han, Jiangben Wang, Bo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies, the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training, i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow. In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~ 3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weigang Lu, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao, Yaming Yang, Yujie Sun, Zheng Liang, Yibing Zhan, Dapeng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for deployment in diverse application settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eva van Tegelen, George van Voorn, Ioannis Athanasiadis, Peter van Heijster</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous, data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations, presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of data available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlotte Geier (Dynamics Group, Hamburg University of Technology), Merten Stender (Chair of Cyber-Physical Systems in Mechanical Engineering, Technische Universit\"at Berlin, Germany)</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lindsay A. Rutter, Abhishek Sharma, Ian Seet, David Obeh Alobo, An Goto, Leroy Cronin</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history. Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models. Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mulin Chen, Bocheng Wang, Jiaxin Zhong, Zongcheng Miao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model, GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%, respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility, particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Muhao Guo, Yang Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data, and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting, frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting, few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency, scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy integration and optimized grid management.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Ching Hsu, Ga\"etan Frusque, Florent Forest, Felipe Macedo, Christian M. Franck, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB system operation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of 227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76 in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age (0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed -- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early disease stages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngmin Seo, Yunhyeong Kwon, Younghun Park, HwiRyong Kim, Seungho Eum, Jinha Kim, Taigon Song, Juho Kim, Unsang Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts. Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by 61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis for VLSI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Abrar Jahin, Shahriar Soudeep, M. F. Mridha, Muhammad Mostafa Monowar, Md. Abdul Hamid</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs) often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables: station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity ($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines. Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with $\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet, while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaithra Umesh, Kristian Schultz, Manjunath Mahendra, Saptarshi Bej, Olaf Wolkenhauer</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The framework first generates independent features using any standard generative model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN, TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofan Wang, Nils Thuerey, Philipp Geyer</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML) surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections (CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training and testing datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yifan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences, allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE, quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head, we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page: https://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Yang, Zheyu Zhang, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrii Dzhoha, Katya Mirylenka, Egor Malykh, Marco-Andrea Buchmann, Francesca Catino</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Mario Amorosa, Francesco Conti, Nicola Quercioli, Flavio Zabini, Tayebeh Lotfi Mahyari, Yiqun Ge, Patrizio Frosini</p>
<p>Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances. Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents' actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the number of samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julia Siekiera, Stefan Kramer</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications. By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks (SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matteo Cardaioli, Luca Marangoni, Giada Martini, Francesco Mazzolin, Luca Pajola, Andrea Ferretto Parodi, Alessandra Saitta, Maria Chiara Vernillo</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich, descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment, featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly \textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure (\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise, delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate (\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application, highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain, and outlines promising directions for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sarah Lockfisch, Kristian Schwethelm, Martin Menten, Rickmer Braren, Daniel Rueckert, Alexander Ziller, Georgios Kaissis</p>
<p>Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning models that describe the data equally well but may produce different predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used. In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice; predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we recommend deferring decisions to expert review.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali RajabiNekoo, Laleh Rasoul, Amirfarhad Farhadi, Azadeh Zamanifar</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding, especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuliang Gu, Hongpeng Cao, Marco Caccamo, Naira Hovakimyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory, diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa Barros de Andrade e Sousa, Gregor Miller, Ronan Le Gleut, Dominik Thalmeier, Helena Pelin, Marie Piraud</p>
<p>Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sang-Woo Lee, Sohee Yang, Donghyun Kwak, Noah Y. Siegel</p>
<p>Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity, knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks, utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology, aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasper S. Wijnands, Michiel Van Ginderachter, Bastien Fran\c{c}ois, Sophie Buurman, Piet Termonia, Dieter Van den Bleeken</p>
<p>Abstract: Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph neural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy, outperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs. In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM) approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts, based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences in model design impact relative performance and potential applications. Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain. Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Share market is one of the most important sectors of economic development of a country. Everyday almost all companies issue their shares and investors buy and sell shares of these companies. Generally investors want to buy shares of the companies whose market liquidity is comparatively greater. Market liquidity depends on the average price of a share. In this paper, a thorough linear regression analysis has been performed on the stock market data of Dhaka Stock Exchange. Later, the linear model has been compared with random forest based on different metrics showing better results for random forest model. However, the amount of individual significance of different factors on the variability of stock price has been identified and explained. This paper also shows that the time series data is not capable of generating a predictive linear model for analysis.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungjun Kim, Jungho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework, which meets six key criteria for artificial intelligence-assisted inverse design of optical multilayer thin films (OMTs): accuracy, efficiency, diversity, scalability, flexibility, and interpretability. To enhance the scalability of the existing neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture (F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study, where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent, despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Abdul Hafeez Khan, Parth Ganeriwala, Sarah M. Lehman, Siddhartha Bhattacharyya, Amy Alvarez, Natasha Neogi</p>
<p>Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer parameters than training separate models for each distribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanyam Jain, Marsha Mariya Kappan, Vijeta Sharma</p>
<p>Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine, supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection, surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across domain-independent healthcare scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ans\"atzes that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and two-spatial dimensions. This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU) resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Fard, Arnold X. -X. Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrastructure asset management is essential for sustaining the performance of public infrastructure such as road networks, bridges, and utility networks. Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This advancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader application of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhijan Theja, Mayukha Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants. Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles, which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access. This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt, continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency, Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair energy communities.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian, French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved ninth place with a score of 0.612.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francisco J. Beron-Vera, Gage Bonner</p>
<p>Abstract: Since 2011, rafts of floating \emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently obstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating interactions between clumps of \emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB. Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities. The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring sparsely connected rafts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hitesh Kumar Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic, iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training recommender systems for next-item recommendation often requires unique embeddings to be learned for each item, which may take up most of the trainable parameters for a model. Shared embeddings, such as using content information, can reduce the number of distinct embeddings to be stored in memory. This allows for a more lightweight model; correspondingly, model complexity can be increased due to having fewer embeddings to store in memory. We show the benefit of using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') in improving recommendation accuracy and diversity, while reducing model size, for two music recommendation datasets, including an online A/B test on a music streaming service.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenghui Li, Nicol\'as Garc\'ia Trillos, Housen Li, Leo Suchan</p>
<p>Abstract: Given i.i.d.\ samples $X_n =\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ from a distribution supported on a low dimensional manifold ${M}$ embedded in Eucliden space, we consider the graph Laplacian operator $\Delta_n$ associated to an $\varepsilon$-proximity graph over $X_n$ and study the asymptotic fluctuations of its eigenvalues around their means. In particular, letting $\hat{\lambda}_l^\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\Delta_n$, and under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of decay of $\varepsilon$, we prove that $\sqrt{n } (\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon - \mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical analysis are relaxed.</p>

In most cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture.

<p>Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment. Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and texture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alana A. Bailey, Robert D. Guy</p>
<p>Abstract: Metachronal paddling is a swimming strategy in which an organism oscillates sets of adjacent limbs with a constant phase lag, propagating a metachronal wave through its limbs and propelling it forward. This limb coordination strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight, inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings. Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the number of paddles.</p>

Effective methods for inferring causal relationships from observational data must perform well under finite data and time constraints, where "performing well" implies achieving high, though not perfect accuracy. In his seminal paper A Theory of the Learnable, Valiant highlighted the importance of resource constraints in supervised machine learning, introducing the concept of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning as an alternative to exact learning. Inspired by Valiant's work, we propose the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC) Discovery framework, which extends PAC learning principles to the causal field. This framework emphasizes both computational and sample efficiency for established causal methods such as propensity score techniques and instrumental variable approaches. Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical guarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Agada Joseph Oche, Ademola Glory Folashade, Tirthankar Ghosal, Arpan Biswas</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG, particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms, sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends, providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality, privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally, the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Takuya Inoue (Meteorological Research Institute, Tsukuba, Japan), Takuya Kawabata (Meteorological Research Institute, Tsukuba, Japan)</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling surface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day) forecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models, which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations, the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts, the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable at operational centers with limited computational resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> UMMPK Nawarathne, HMNS Kumari, HMLS Kumari</p>
<p>Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning, allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection capabilities and scalability of underwater cleanup operations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan, Luis Gustavo Nonato, Themis Palpanas, Cl\'audio T. Silva, Juliana Freire</p>
<p>Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohan Yao, Vikas Yadav</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks: MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0% to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their associated agent-based frameworks have significantly advanced automated information extraction, a critical component of modern recommender systems. While these multitask frameworks are widely used in code generation, their application in data-centric research is still largely untapped. This paper presents Agent0, an LLM-driven, agent-based system designed to automate information extraction and feature construction from raw, unstructured text. Categorical features are crucial for large-scale recommender systems but are often expensive to acquire. Agent0 coordinates a group of interacting LLM agents to automatically identify the most valuable text aspects for subsequent tasks (such as models or AutoML pipelines). Beyond its feature engineering capabilities, Agent0 also offers an automated prompt-engineering tuning method that utilizes dynamic feedback loops from an oracle. Our findings demonstrate that this closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective for automated feature discovery, which is recognized as one of the most challenging phases in current recommender system development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binxu Li, Yuhui Zhang, Xiaohan Wang, Weixin Liang, Ludwig Schmidt, Serena Yeung-Levy</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4 percentage points, while using 75x less compute.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Antonio Tudisco, Deborah Volpe, Giacomo Orlandi, Giovanna Turvani</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Jiaming Zhang, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking, enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting further research in this area.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maria Zaitseva, Ivan Tomilov, Natalia Gusarova</p>
<p>Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our "gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active. This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning, and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Amir, Guang Yang, Zhan Gao, Keisuke Okumura, Heedo Woo, Amanda Prorok</p>
<p>Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Elefante, Gianluca Giacchi, Michael Multerer, Jacopo Quizi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets, and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction. We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation, we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness, scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaymaa Abbas, Mariette Awad, Razane Tajeddine</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models (LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE) versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models, we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE. Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the codec's implicit interpolation during decoding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Osama Almurshed, Ashish Kaushal, Asmail Muftah, Nitin Auluck, Omer Rana</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger, more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios. Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs. donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however, it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a structured approximation (low-rank, sparse, banded, etc.) to an unknown matrix $A$ given access to matrix-vector product (matvec) queries of the form $x \rightarrow Ax$ and $x \rightarrow A^Tx$. This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific computing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and inversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order optimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work focuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning specific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.
  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to understand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix families. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to $A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\mathcal{F}$. Standard results from matrix sketching show that $O(\log|\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice in this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for vector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have been widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.
  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a nearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log|\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is tight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends to well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a near-optimal approximation from any \emph{linear matrix family} of dimension $q$ can be learned with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an $O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Singh, Petros Koumoutsakos</p>
<p>Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology, flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive, self-organized materials.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Szymon Talaga, Dominik Batorski, Magdalena Wojcieszak</p>
<p>Abstract: Although news negativity is often studied, missing is comparative evidence on the prevalence of and engagement with negative political and non-political news posts on social media. We use 6,081,134 Facebook posts published between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2024, by 97 media organizations in six countries (U.S., UK, Ireland, Poland, France, Spain) and develop two multilingual classifiers for labeling posts as (non-)political and (non-)negative. We show that: (1) negative news posts constitute a relatively small fraction (12.6%); (2) political news posts are neither more nor less negative than non-political news posts; (3) U.S. political news posts are less negative relative to the other countries on average (40% lower odds); (4) Negative news posts get 15% fewer likes and 13% fewer comments than non-negative news posts. Lastly, (5) we provide estimates of the proportion of the total volume of user engagement with negative news posts and show that only between 10.2% to 13.1% of engagement is linked to negative posts by the analyzed news organizations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shayan S. Mousavi Masouleh, Corey A. Sanz, Ryan P. Jansonius, Cara Cronin, Jason E. Hein, Jason Hattrick-Simpers</p>
<p>Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources, unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible, potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viktar Dubovik, {\L}ukasz Struski, Jacek Tabor, Dawid Rymarczyk</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision. Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent. InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet, but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability of prototype-based explanations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark, EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately 1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve. These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning, shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments, and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks (\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks. Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection depends on user priorities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Flavio Petruzzellis, Alberto Testolin, Alessandro Sperduti</p>
<p>Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself. We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router, a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However, the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic, circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%. Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs. In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marianna Pensky</p>
<p>Abstract: The paper studies the DIverse MultiPLEx Signed Generalized Random Dot Product Graph (DIMPLE-SGRDPG) network model (Pensky (2024)), where all layers of the network have the same collection of nodes. In addition, all layers can be partitioned into groups such that the layers in the same group are embedded in the same ambient subspace but otherwise matrices of connection probabilities can be all different. This setting includes majority of multilayer network models as its particular cases. The key task in this model is to recover the groups of layers with unique subspace structures, since the case where all layers of the network are embedded in the same subspace has been fairly well studied. Until now, clustering of layers in such networks was based on the layer-per-layer analysis, which required the multilayer network to be sufficiently dense. Nevertheless, in this paper we succeeded in pooling information in all layers together and providing a tensor-based methodology that ensures perfect clustering for a much sparser network. Our theoretical results, established under intuitive non-restrictive assumptions, assert that the new technique achieves perfect clustering under sparsity conditions that, up to logarithmic factors, coincide with the computational lower bound derived for a much simpler model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for materials science, enabling the study of larger systems and longer timescales. State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse, scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer, MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an inference-time search strategy for code optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amir Fard, Arnold X. -X. Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pol Francesch Huc, Emily Bates, Simone D'Amico</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2) a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3) and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize 3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques. This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision, the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We develop efficient algorithms for optimizing piecewise smooth (PWS) functions where the underlying partition of the domain into smooth pieces is \emph{unknown}. For PWS functions satisfying a quadratic growth (QG) condition, we propose a bundle-level (BL) type method that achieves global linear convergence -- to our knowledge, the first such result for any algorithm for this problem class. We extend this method to handle approximately PWS functions and to solve weakly-convex PWS problems, improving the state-of-the-art complexity to match the benchmark for smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we introduce the first verifiable and accurate termination criterion for PWS optimization. Similar to the gradient norm in smooth optimization, this certificate tightly characterizes the optimality gap under the QG condition, and can moreover be evaluated without knowledge of any problem parameters. We develop a search subroutine for this certificate and embed it within a guess-and-check framework, resulting in an almost parameter-free algorithm for both the convex QG and weakly-convex settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anton Pembek, Artem Fatkulin, Anton Klenitskiy, Alexey Vasilev</p>
<p>Abstract: Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where items with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due to the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities, including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset with audio-based representation.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an invertible mapping, called B-KRnet, on a bounded domain and apply it to density estimation/approximation for data or the solutions of PDEs such as the Fokker-Planck equation and the Keller-Segel equation. Similar to KRnet, B-KRnet consists of a series of coupling layers with progressively fewer active transformation dimensions, inspired by the triangular structure of the Knothe-Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangement. The main difference between B-KRnet and KRnet is that B-KRnet is defined on a hypercube while KRnet is defined on the whole space, in other words, a new mechanism is introduced in B-KRnet to maintain the exact invertibility. Using B-KRnet as a transport map, we obtain an explicit probability density function (PDF) model that corresponds to the pushforward of a base (uniform) distribution on the hypercube. It can be directly applied to density estimation when only data are available. By coupling KRnet and B-KRnet, we define a deep generative model on a high-dimensional domain where some dimensions are bounded and other dimensions are unbounded. A typical case is the solution of the stationary kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, which is a PDF of position and momentum. Based on B-KRnet, we develop an adaptive learning approach to approximate partial differential equations whose solutions are PDFs or can be treated as PDFs. A variety of numerical experiments is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of B-KRnet.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geri Skenderi, Luigi Capogrosso, Andrea Toaiari, Matteo Denitto, Franco Fummi, Simone Melzi</p>
<p>Abstract: Auxiliary tasks facilitate learning in situations where data is scarce or the principal task of interest is extremely complex. This idea is primarily inspired by the improved generalization capability induced by solving multiple tasks simultaneously, which leads to a more robust shared representation. Nevertheless, finding optimal auxiliary tasks is a crucial problem that often requires hand-crafted solutions or expensive meta-learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed Detaux, whereby a weakly supervised disentanglement procedure is used to discover a new unrelated auxiliary classification task, which allows us to go from a Single-Task Learning (STL) to a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) problem. The disentanglement procedure works at the representation level, isolating the variation related to the principal task into an isolated subspace and additionally producing an arbitrary number of orthogonal subspaces, each of which encourages high separability among projections. We generate the auxiliary classification task through a clustering procedure on the most disentangled subspace, obtaining a discrete set of labels. Subsequently, the original data, the labels associated with the principal task, and the newly discovered ones can be fed into any MTL framework. Experimental validation on both synthetic and real data, along with various ablation studies, demonstrates promising results, revealing the potential in what has been, so far, an unexplored connection between learning disentangled representations and MTL.

<p>Abstract: Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) represent sophisticated attack patterns in the cybersecurity domain, described encyclopedically in textual knowledge bases. Identifying TTPs in cybersecurity writing, often called TTP mapping, is an important and challenging task. Conventional learning approaches often target the problem in the classical multi-class or multilabel classification setting. This setting hinders the learning ability of the model due to a large number of classes (i.e., TTPs), the inevitable skewness of the label distribution and the complex hierarchical structure of the label space. We formulate the problem in a different learning paradigm, where the assignment of a text to a TTP label is decided by the direct semantic similarity between the two, thus reducing the complexity of competing solely over the large labeling space. To that end, we propose a neural matching architecture with an effective sampling-based learn-to-compare mechanism, facilitating the learning process of the matching model despite constrained resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fatemeh Nazary, Yashar Deldjoo, Tommaso Di Noia, Eugenio di Sciascio</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical decision support systems require models that are not only highly accurate but also equitable and sensitive to the implications of missed diagnoses. In this study, we introduce a knowledge-guided in-context learning (ICL) framework designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to effectively process structured clinical data. Our approach integrates domain-specific feature groupings, carefully balanced few-shot examples, and task-specific prompting strategies. We systematically evaluate this method across seventy distinct ICL designs by various prompt variations and two different communication styles-natural-language narrative and numeric conversational-and compare its performance to robust classical machine learning (ML) benchmarks on tasks involving heart disease and diabetes prediction.
  Our findings indicate that while traditional ML models maintain superior performance in balanced precision-recall scenarios, LLMs employing narrative prompts with integrated domain knowledge achieve higher recall and significantly reduce gender bias, effectively narrowing fairness disparities by an order of magnitude. Despite the current limitation of increased inference latency, LLMs provide notable advantages, including the capacity for zero-shot deployment and enhanced equity. This research offers the first comprehensive analysis of ICL design considerations for applying LLMs to tabular clinical tasks and highlights distillation and multimodal extensions as promising directions for future research.</p>

In this work we explore a simple, effective adaptive inference technique we term Agreement-Based Cascading (ABC). ABC builds a cascade of models of increasing size/complexity, and uses agreement between ensembles of models at each level of the cascade as a basis for data-dependent routing. Although ensemble execution introduces additional expense, we show that these costs can be easily offset in practice due to large expected differences in model sizes, parallel inference execution capabilities, and accuracy benefits of ensembling. We examine ABC theoretically and empirically in terms of these parameters, showing that the approach can reliably act as a drop-in replacement for existing models and surpass the best single model it aims to replace in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we explore the performance of ABC relative to existing cascading methods in three common scenarios: (1) edge-to-cloud inference, where ABC reduces communication costs by up to 14x; (2) cloud-based model serving, where it achieves a 3x reduction in rental costs; and (3) inference via model API services, where ABC achieves a 2-25x reduction in average price per token/request relative to state-of-the-art LLM cascades.</p>

<p>Abstract: Function calling significantly extends the application boundary of large language models, where high-quality and diverse training data is critical for unlocking this capability. However, real function-calling data is quite challenging to collect and annotate, while synthetic data generated by existing pipelines tends to lack coverage and accuracy. In this paper, we present ToolACE, an automatic agentic pipeline designed to generate accurate, complex, and diverse tool-learning data. ToolACE leverages a novel self-evolution synthesis process to curate a comprehensive API pool of 26,507 diverse APIs. Dialogs are further generated through the interplay among multiple agents, guided by a formalized thinking process. To ensure data accuracy, we implement a dual-layer verification system combining rule-based and model-based checks. We demonstrate that models trained on our synthesized data, even with only 8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, rivaling the latest GPT-4 models. Our model and a subset of the data are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Team-ACE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amaury Wei, Olga Fink</p>
<p>Abstract: Rigid body interactions are fundamental to numerous scientific disciplines, but remain challenging to simulate due to their abrupt nonlinear nature and sensitivity to complex, often unknown environmental factors. These challenges call for adaptable learning-based methods capable of capturing complex interactions beyond explicit physical models and simulations. While graph neural networks can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex scenes and long-term predictions. We introduce a novel framework for modeling rigid body dynamics and learning collision interactions, addressing key limitations of existing graph-based methods. Our approach extends the traditional representation of meshes by incorporating higher-order topology complexes, offering a physically consistent representation. Additionally, we propose a physics-informed message-passing neural architecture, embedding physical laws directly in the model. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy, even during long rollouts, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios. Importantly, this work addresses the challenge of multi-entity dynamic interactions, with applications spanning diverse scientific and engineering domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Adamczyk, Volodymyr Makarenko, Stas Tiomkin, Rahul V. Kulkarni</p>
<p>Abstract: In reinforcement learning, especially in sparse-reward domains, many environment steps are required to observe reward information. In order to increase the frequency of such observations, "potential-based reward shaping" (PBRS) has been proposed as a method of providing a more dense reward signal while leaving the optimal policy invariant. However, the required "potential function" must be carefully designed with task-dependent knowledge to not deter training performance. In this work, we propose a "bootstrapped" method of reward shaping, termed BSRS, in which the agent's current estimate of the state-value function acts as the potential function for PBRS. We provide convergence proofs for the tabular setting, give insights into training dynamics for deep RL, and show that the proposed method improves training speed in the Atari suite.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satvik Golechha, Maheep Chaudhary, Joan Velja, Alessandro Abate, Nandi Schoots</p>
<p>Abstract: An approach to improve neural network interpretability is via clusterability, i.e., splitting a model into disjoint clusters that can be studied independently. We define a measure for clusterability and show that pre-trained models form highly enmeshed clusters via spectral graph clustering. We thus train models to be more modular using a "clusterability loss" function that encourages the formation of non-interacting clusters. We then investigate the emerging properties of these highly clustered models. We find our trained clustered models do not exhibit more task specialization, but do form smaller circuits. We investigate CNNs trained on MNIST and CIFAR, small transformers trained on modular addition, and GPT-2 and Pythia on the Wiki dataset, and Gemma on a Chemistry dataset. This investigation shows what to expect from clustered models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniil Laptev, Nikita Balagansky, Yaroslav Aksenov, Daniil Gavrilov</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new approach to systematically map features discovered by sparse autoencoder across consecutive layers of large language models, extending earlier work that examined inter-layer feature links. By using a data-free cosine similarity technique, we trace how specific features persist, transform, or first appear at each stage. This method yields granular flow graphs of feature evolution, enabling fine-grained interpretability and mechanistic insights into model computations. Crucially, we demonstrate how these cross-layer feature maps facilitate direct steering of model behavior by amplifying or suppressing chosen features, achieving targeted thematic control in text generation. Together, our findings highlight the utility of a causal, cross-layer interpretability framework that not only clarifies how features develop through forward passes but also provides new means for transparent manipulation of large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oleh Rybkin, Michal Nauman, Preston Fu, Charlie Snell, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling data and compute is critical to the success of modern ML. However, scaling demands predictability: we want methods to not only perform well with more compute or data, but also have their performance be predictable from small-scale runs, without running the large-scale experiment. In this paper, we show that value-based off-policy RL methods are predictable despite community lore regarding their pathological behavior. First, we show that data and compute requirements to attain a given performance level lie on a Pareto frontier, controlled by the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio. By estimating this frontier, we can predict this data requirement when given more compute, and this compute requirement when given more data. Second, we determine the optimal allocation of a total resource budget across data and compute for a given performance and use it to determine hyperparameters that maximize performance for a given budget. Third, this scaling is enabled by first estimating predictable relationships between hyperparameters, which is used to manage effects of overfitting and plasticity loss unique to RL. We validate our approach using three algorithms: SAC, BRO, and PQL on DeepMind Control, OpenAI gym, and IsaacGym, when extrapolating to higher levels of data, compute, budget, or performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbo Li, Zhangyang Wang, Qiang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline preference alignment for language models such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is favored for its effectiveness and simplicity, eliminating the need for costly reinforcement learning. Various offline algorithms have been developed for different data settings, yet they lack a unified understanding.
  In this study, we introduce Pior-Informed Preference Alignment (PIPA), a unified, RL-free probabilistic framework that formulates language model preference alignment as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem with prior constraints. This method effectively accommodates both paired and unpaired data, as well as answer and step-level annotations. We illustrate that DPO and KTO are special cases with different prior constraints within our framework. By integrating different types of prior information, we developed two variations of PIPA: PIPA-M and PIPA-N. Both algorithms demonstrate a $3\sim10\%$ performance enhancement on the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks across all configurations, achieving these gains without additional training or computational costs compared to existing algorithms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings mitigate the risks associated with large-scale distillation by enabling compute-optimal allocation for both the teacher and student to maximize student performance. We provide compute-optimal distillation recipes for two key scenarios: when a teacher already exists, and when a teacher needs training. In settings involving many students or an existing teacher, distillation outperforms supervised learning up to a compute level that scales predictably with student size. Conversely, if only one student is to be distilled and a teacher also requires training, supervised learning is generally preferable. Additionally, our large-scale study of distillation increases our understanding of the process and helps inform experimental design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Que, Remco Poelarends, Peter Veltink, Miriam Vollenbroek-Hutten, Ying Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) can be measured from breath-by-breath respiratory data, which can serve as a reference. Alternatively, PAEE can be predicted from the body movements, which can be measured and estimated with accelerometers. The body center of mass (COM) acceleration reflects the movements of the whole body and thus serves as a good predictor for PAEE. However, the wrist has also become a popular location due to recent advancements in wrist-worn devices. Therefore, in this work, using the respiratory data measured by COSMED K5 as the reference, we evaluated and compared the performances of COM-based settings and wrist-based settings. The COM-based settings include two different accelerometer compositions, using only the pelvis accelerometer (pelvis-acc) and the pelvis accelerometer with two accelerometers from two thighs (3-acc). The wrist-based settings include using only the left wrist accelerometer (l-wrist-acc) and only the right wrist accelerometer (r-wrist-acc). We implemented two existing PAEE estimation methods on our collected dataset, where 9 participants performed activities of daily living while wearing 5 accelerometers (i.e., pelvis, two thighs, and two wrists). These two methods include a linear regression (LR) model and a CNN-LSTM model. Both models yielded the best results with the COM-based 3-acc setting (LR: $R^2$ = 0.41, CNN-LSTM: $R^2$ = 0.53). No significant difference was found between the 3-acc and pelvis-acc settings (p-value = 0.278). For both models, neither the l-wrist-acc nor the r-wrist-acc settings demonstrated predictive power on PAEE with $R^2$ values close to 0, significantly outperformed by the two COM-based settings (p-values $<$ 0.05). No significant difference was found between the two wrists (p-value = 0.329).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin C. Koenig, Suyong Kim, Sili Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is a promising alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for data-driven modeling. While original KAN layers were only capable of representing the addition operator, the recently-proposed MultKAN layer combines addition and multiplication subnodes in an effort to improve representation performance. Here, we find that MultKAN layers suffer from a few key drawbacks including limited applicability in output layers, bulky parameterizations with extraneous activations, and the inclusion of complex hyperparameters. To address these issues, we propose LeanKANs, a direct and modular replacement for MultKAN and traditional AddKAN layers. LeanKANs address these three drawbacks of MultKAN through general applicability as output layers, significantly reduced parameter counts for a given network structure, and a smaller set of hyperparameters. As a one-to-one layer replacement for standard AddKAN and MultKAN layers, LeanKAN is able to provide these benefits to traditional KAN learning problems as well as augmented KAN structures in which it serves as the backbone, such as KAN Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) or Deep Operator KANs (DeepOKAN). We demonstrate LeanKAN's simplicity and efficiency in a series of demonstrations carried out across a standard KAN toy problem as well as ordinary and partial differential equations learned via KAN-ODEs, where we find that its sparser parameterization and compact structure serve to increase its expressivity and learning capability, leading it to outperform similar and even much larger MultKANs in various tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davor Vukadin, Marin \v{S}ili\'c, Goran Dela\v{c}</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanglin Zhou, Sebastiano Barbieri</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calarina Muslimani, Kerrick Johnstonbaugh, Suyog Chandramouli, Serena Booth, W. Bradley Knox, Matthew E. Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents are fundamentally limited by the quality of the reward functions they learn from, yet reward design is often overlooked under the assumption that a well-defined reward is readily available. However, in practice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating their correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function is correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on reward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the preferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment, we introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity between a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those induced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a ground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and applicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL practitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient during reward selection led to statistically significant improvements. Compared to relying only on reward functions, our metric reduced cognitive workload by 1.5x, was preferred by 82% of users and increased the success rate of selecting reward functions that produced performant policies by 41%.</p>

<p>Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have become promising alternatives to softmax-attention as sequence mixing layers in Transformer architectures. Current models, however, do not exhibit the full state-tracking expressivity of RNNs because they rely on channel-wise (i.e. diagonal) sequence mixing. In this paper, we investigate parameterizations of a large class of dense linear RNNs as fixed-points of parallelizable diagonal linear RNNs. The resulting models can naturally trade expressivity for efficiency at a fixed number of parameters and achieve state-of-the-art results on the commonly used toy tasks $A_5$, $S_5$, copying, and modular arithmetics.</p>

Through comprehensive backtesting across diverse market universes and neural architectures, shows superior performance compared to both traditional strategies and leading machine learning-based methods, including Prediction-Focused Learning and End-to-End Learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Abbasishahkoo, Mahboubeh Dadkhah, Lionel Briand, Dayi Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face challenges during deployment due to data distribution shifts. Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained models to new contexts requiring smaller labeled sets. However, testing fine-tuned models under constrained labeling budgets remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces MetaSel, a new approach, tailored for fine-tuned DNN models, to select tests from unlabeled inputs. MetaSel assumes that fine-tuned and pre-trained models share related data distributions and exhibit similar behaviors for many inputs. However, their behaviors diverge within the input subspace where fine-tuning alters decision boundaries, making those inputs more prone to misclassification. Unlike general approaches that rely solely on the DNN model and its input set, MetaSel leverages information from both the fine-tuned and pre-trained models and their behavioral differences to estimate misclassification probability for unlabeled test inputs, enabling more effective test selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation, comparing MetaSel against 11 state-of-the-art approaches and involving 68 fine-tuned models across weak, medium, and strong distribution shifts, demonstrates that MetaSel consistently delivers significant improvements in Test Relative Coverage (TRC) over existing baselines, particularly under highly constrained labeling budgets. MetaSel shows average TRC improvements of 28.46% to 56.18% over the most frequent second-best baselines while maintaining a high TRC median and low variability. Our results confirm MetaSel's practicality, robustness, and cost-effectiveness for test selection in the context of fine-tuned models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chang Gao, Kang Zhao, Runqi Wang, Jianfei Chen, Liping Jing</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but their enormous size poses significant challenges for deployment in real-world applications. To address this issue, researchers have sought to apply network pruning techniques to LLMs. A critical challenge in pruning is allocation the sparsity for each layer. Recent sparsity allocation methods is often based on heuristics or search that can easily lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we conducted an extensive investigation into various LLMs and revealed three significant discoveries: (1) the layerwise pruning sensitivity (LPS) of LLMs is highly non-uniform, (2) the choice of pruning metric affects LPS, and (3) the performance of a sparse model is related to the uniformity of its layerwise redundancy level. Based on these observations, we propose that the layerwise sparsity of LLMs should adhere to three principles: \emph{non-uniformity}, \emph{pruning metric dependency}, and \emph{uniform layerwise redundancy level} in the pruned model. To this end, we proposed Maximum Redundancy Pruning (MRP), an iterative pruning algorithm that prunes in the most redundant layers (\emph{i.e.}, those with the highest non-outlier ratio) at each iteration. The achieved layerwise sparsity aligns with the outlined principles. We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available LLMs, including the LLaMA2 and OPT, across various benchmarks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of MRP, demonstrating its superiority over previous methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jing Li, Hao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tasks in high energy physics, yet their opaque training process renders them as a black box. In contrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and interpretability but requires extensive manual tuning to identify optimal cut boundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable Cut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection into a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut strategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently, and sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine optimal boundaries. Building on this strategy, we introduce the Learnable Importance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their contributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike ad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces hard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training process. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs. QCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF 1. accurately learns cut boundaries across typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential strategies, 2. assigns higher importance to discriminative features with minimal overlap, 3. handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and 4. performs effectively in real-world scenarios. In the diboson dataset, LCF initially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when using all observables. However, pruning less critical features-guided by learned importance-boosts its performance to match or exceed these baselines. LCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method and modern black-box neural networks, delivering actionable insights into the training process and feature importance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayin Liu, Chenglong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Auctions are important mechanisms extensively implemented in various markets, e.g., search engines' keyword auctions, antique auctions, etc. Finding an optimal auction mechanism is extremely difficult due to the constraints of imperfect information, incentive compatibility (IC), and individual rationality (IR). In addition to the traditional economic methods, some recently attempted to find the optimal (single) auction using deep learning methods. Unlike those attempts focusing on single auctions, we develop deep learning methods for double auctions, where imperfect information exists on both the demand and supply sides. The previous attempts on single auction cannot directly apply to our contexts and those attempts additionally suffer from limited generalizability, inefficiency in ensuring the constraints, and learning fluctuations. We innovate in designing deep learning models for solving the more complex problem and additionally addressing the previous models' three limitations. Specifically, we achieve generalizability by leveraging a transformer-based architecture to model market participants as sequences for varying market sizes; we utilize the numerical features of the constraints and pre-treat them for a higher learning efficiency; we develop a gradient-conflict-elimination scheme to address the problem of learning fluctuation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach to classical and machine learning baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sasan Tavakkol, Max Springer, Mohammadhossein Bateni, Neslihan Bulut, Vincent Cohen-Addad, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi</p>
<p>Abstract: Synthetic training data generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemma and OpenAI's GPT offer a promising solution to the challenge of obtaining large, labeled datasets for training classifiers. When rapid model deployment is critical, such as in classifying emerging social media trends or combating new forms of online abuse tied to current events, the ability to generate training data is invaluable. While prior research has examined the comparability of synthetic data to human-labeled data, this study introduces a novel sampling algorithm, based on the maximum coverage problem, to select a representative subset from a synthetically generated dataset. Our results demonstrate that training a classifier on this contextually sampled subset achieves superior performance compared to training on the entire dataset. This "less is more" approach not only improves model accuracy but also reduces the volume of data required, leading to potentially more efficient model fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qitao Tan, Sung-En Chang, Rui Xia, Huidong Ji, Chence Yang, Ci Zhang, Jun Liu, Zheng Zhan, Zhenman Fang, Zhou Zou, Yanzhi Wang, Jin Lu, Geng Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is an emerging deep neural network (DNN) training paradigm that offers computational simplicity and memory savings. However, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored challenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random numbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for hardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this critical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware designers. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO framework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to significantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a hardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO reduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6\% and 12.7\%, and saves at maximum 86\% power consumption, all without compromising training performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of on-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingting Zhang, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, David J. Love, Taejoon Kim, Kai Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Smith, Erhan Guven</p>
<p>Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning offers a path to leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for drug discovery, but optimal model architectures remain unclear. We systematically optimize the quantum-classical bridge architecture of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for molecule discovery using multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Our optimized model (BO-QGAN) significantly improves performance, achieving a 2.27-fold higher Drug Candidate Score (DCS) than prior quantum-hybrid benchmarks and 2.21-fold higher than the classical baseline, while reducing parameter count by more than 60%. Key findings favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits sequentially, while classical architecture shows less sensitivity above a minimum capacity. This work provides the first empirically-grounded architectural guidelines for hybrid models, enabling more effective integration of current quantum computers into pharmaceutical research pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric V. Strobl</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Abstract: Satellite remote sensing from repeated observations and multiple sensors enables a wide range of downstream applications, including climate modeling, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous, often corrupted by sensor noise, clouds, and atmospheric conditions, and unevenly spaced in time, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA uses two parallel Transformer-based encoders to combine optical data from ten Sentinel-2 spectral bands at 10-60~m spatial resolution and two Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are subsequently fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, openness, computation-, label-, and data-efficiency, and high performance will prove transformative in a wide range of vegetation-oriented ecological and agricultural applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments with sparse or adversarial reward structures. In this work, we study how the architecture of deep neural policies implicitly shapes exploration before training. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate strategies for generating ballistic or diffusive trajectories from untrained policies in a toy model. Using the theory of infinite-width networks and a continuous-time limit, we show that untrained policies return correlated actions and result in non-trivial state-visitation distributions. We discuss the distributions of the corresponding trajectories for a standard architecture, revealing insights into inductive biases for tackling exploration. Our results establish a theoretical and experimental framework for using policy initialization as a design tool to understand exploration behavior in early training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Prady Saligram, Tanvir Bhathal, Robby Manihani</p>
<p>Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback, they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants: standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN (H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to 5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048 tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neel Rajani, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant, Ivan Titov</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.</p>

Our results show that this circuit-level architecture delivers promising performance while adhering to the principles of next-generation RC -- eliminating random connectivity in favour of a deterministic nonlinear transformation of input signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhi Liu, Zixuan Chen, Zirui Zhang, Yufei Liu, Giulia Lanzillotta</p>
<p>Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) offers a powerful tool to study the functional dynamics of neural networks. In the so-called lazy, or kernel regime, the NTK remains static during training and the network function is linear in the static neural tangents feature space. The evolution of the NTK during training is necessary for feature learning, a key driver of deep learning success. The study of the NTK dynamics has led to several critical discoveries in recent years, in generalization and scaling behaviours. However, this body of work has been limited to the single task setting, where the data distribution is assumed constant over time. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis of NTK dynamics in continual learning, where the data distribution shifts over time. Our findings highlight continual learning as a rich and underutilized testbed for probing the dynamics of neural training. At the same time, they challenge the validity of static-kernel approximations in theoretical treatments of continual learning, even at large scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuokun Chen, Zeren Chen, Jiahao He, Mingkui Tan, Jianfei Cai, Bohan Zhuang</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation (CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riting Xia, Rucong Wang, Yulin Liu, Anchen Li, Xueyan Liu, Yan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue, they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this paper systematically investigates robust node classification for class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.</p>

<p>Abstract: Analysing and understanding the transmission and evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic is mandatory to be able to design the best social and medical policies, foresee their outcomes and deal with all the subsequent socio-economic effects. We address this important problem from a computational and machine learning perspective. More specifically, we want to statistically estimate all the relevant parameters for the new coronavirus COVID-19, such as the reproduction number, fatality rate or length of infectiousness period, based on Romanian patients, as well as be able to predict future outcomes. This endeavor is important, since it is well known that these factors vary across the globe, and might be dependent on many causes, including social, medical, age and genetic factors. We use a recently published improved version of SEIR, which is the classic, established model for infectious diseases. We want to infer all the parameters of the model, which govern the evolution of the pandemic in Romania, based on the only reliable, true measurement, which is the number of deaths. Once the model parameters are estimated, we are able to predict all the other relevant measures, such as the number of exposed and infectious people. To this end, we propose a self-supervised approach to train a deep convolutional network to guess the correct set of Modified-SEIR model parameters, given the observed number of daily fatalities. Then, we refine the solution with a stochastic coordinate descent approach. We compare our deep learning optimization scheme with the classic grid search approach and show great improvement in both computational time and prediction accuracy. We find an optimistic result in the case fatality rate for Romania which may be around 0.3% and we also demonstrate that our model is able to correctly predict the number of daily fatalities for up to three weeks in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> L\'ena\"ic Chizat</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a general formulation of regularized Wasserstein barycenters that enjoys favorable regularity, approximation, stability and (grid-free) optimization properties. This barycenter is defined as the unique probability measure that minimizes the sum of entropic optimal transport (EOT) costs with respect to a family of given probability measures, plus an entropy term. We denote it $(\lambda,\tau)$-barycenter, where $\lambda$ is the inner regularization strength and $\tau$ the outer one. This formulation recovers several previously proposed EOT barycenters for various choices of $\lambda,\tau \geq 0$ and generalizes them. First, in spite of -- and in fact owing to -- being \emph{doubly} regularized, we show that our formulation is debiased for $\tau=\lambda/2$: the suboptimality in the (unregularized) Wasserstein barycenter objective is, for smooth densities, of the order of the strength $\lambda^2$ of entropic regularization, instead of $\max\{\lambda,\tau\}$ in general. We discuss this phenomenon for isotropic Gaussians where all $(\lambda,\tau)$-barycenters have closed form. Second, we show that for $\lambda,\tau>0$, this barycenter has a smooth density and is strongly stable under perturbation of the marginals. In particular, it can be estimated efficiently: given $n$ samples from each of the probability measures, it converges in relative entropy to the population barycenter at a rate $n^{-1/2}$. And finally, this formulation lends itself naturally to a grid-free optimization algorithm: we propose a simple \emph{noisy particle gradient descent} which, in the mean-field limit, converges globally at an exponential rate to the barycenter.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence has surged in recent years, with advancements in machine learning rapidly impacting nearly every area of life. However, the growing complexity of these models has far outpaced advancements in available hardware accelerators, leading to significant computational and energy demands, primarily due to matrix multiplications, which dominate the compute workload. Maddness (i.e., Multiply-ADDitioN-lESS) presents a hash-based version of product quantization, which renders matrix multiplications into lookups and additions, eliminating the need for multipliers entirely. We present Stella Nera, the first Maddness-based accelerator achieving an energy efficiency of 161 TOp/s/W@0.55V, 25x better than conventional MatMul accelerators due to its small components and reduced computational complexity. We further enhance Maddness with a differentiable approximation, allowing for gradient-based fine-tuning and achieving an end-to-end performance of 92.5% Top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuji Kawamata, Ryoki Motai, Yukihiko Okada, Akira Imakura, Tetsuya Sakurai</p>
<p>Abstract: The estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) is an important topic in many scientific fields. CATEs can be estimated with high accuracy if data distributed across multiple parties are centralized. However, it is difficult to aggregate such data owing to confidentiality or privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose data collaboration double machine learning, a method for estimating CATE models using privacy-preserving fusion data constructed from distributed sources, and evaluate its performance through simulations. We make three main contributions. First, our method enables estimation and testing of semi-parametric CATE models without iterative communication on distributed data, providing robustness to model mis-specification compared to parametric approaches. Second, it enables collaborative estimation across different time points and parties by accumulating a knowledge base. Third, our method performs as well as or better than existing methods in simulations using synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> M. Quattromini, M. A. Bucci, S. Cherubini, O. Semeraro</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their widespread use, purely data-driven methods often suffer from overfitting, lack of physical consistency, and high data dependency, particularly when physical constraints are not incorporated. This study introduces a novel data assimilation approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with optimisation techniques to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction, using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a baseline. The method leverages the adjoint approach, incorporating RANS-derived gradients as optimisation terms during GNN training, ensuring that the learned model adheres to physical laws and maintains consistency. Additionally, the GNN framework is well-suited for handling unstructured data, which is common in the complex geometries encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The GNN is interfaced with the Finite Element Method (FEM) for numerical simulations, enabling accurate modelling in unstructured domains. We consider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds numbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery, denoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the approach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training process, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it particularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of mean flow reconstructions, even with limited training data, compared to analogous purely data-driven models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng-Fu Yang, Da Yin, Wenbo Hu, Nanyun Peng, Bolei Zhou, Kai-Wei Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans recognize objects after observing only a few examples, a remarkable capability enabled by their inherent language understanding of the real-world environment. Developing verbalized and interpretable representation can significantly improve model generalization in low-data settings. In this work, we propose Verbalized Representation Learning (VRL), a novel approach for automatically extracting human-interpretable features for object recognition using few-shot data. Our method uniquely captures inter-class differences and intra-class commonalities in the form of natural language by employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify key discriminative features between different classes and shared characteristics within the same class. These verbalized features are then mapped to numeric vectors through the VLM. The resulting feature vectors can be further utilized to train and infer with downstream classifiers. Experimental results show that, at the same model scale, VRL achieves a 24% absolute improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods while using 95% less data and a smaller mode. Furthermore, compared to human-labeled attributes, the features learned by VRL exhibit a 20% absolute gain when used for downstream classification tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiong Wu, Wenhao Lin, Yiyi Zhou, Weihao Ye, Zhanpeng Zen, Xiaoshuai Sun, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: The excessive use of visual tokens in existing Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often exhibits obvious redundancy and brings in prohibitively expensive computation. To gain insights into this problem, we first conduct extensive empirical studies on the attention behaviors of MLLMs, and summarize three main inference stages in MLLMs: (i) Early fusion between tokens is first accomplished quickly. (ii) Intra-modality modeling then comes to play. (iii) Multimodal reasoning} resumes and lasts until the end of inference. In particular, we reveal that visual tokens will stop contributing to reasoning when the text tokens receive enough image information, yielding obvious visual redundancy. Based on these generalized observations, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve the efficiency of MLLMs, termed dynamic visual-token exit (DyVTE). DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive the text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a certain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate VTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well facilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theo Lepage, Reda Dehak</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have demonstrated significant potential for Speaker Verification (SV), but closing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. SSL frameworks rely on anchor-positive pairs, constructed from segments of the same audio utterance. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those of their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation. Therefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it encodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned representations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives in SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the representation space, assuming that these pseudo-positives belong to the same speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method consistently demonstrates improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks when applied to major SSL frameworks, including SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO. Using SSPS, SimCLR and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, respectively. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cen-Jhih Li, Aditya Bhaskara</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning is an important step in adapting foundation models such as large language models to downstream tasks. To make this step more accessible to users with limited computational budgets, it is crucial to develop fine-tuning methods that are memory and computationally efficient. Sparse Fine-tuning (SpFT) and Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) are two frameworks that have emerged for addressing this problem and have been adopted widely in practice. In this work, we develop a new SpFT framework, based on ideas from neural network pruning. At a high level, we first identify ``important'' neurons/nodes using feature importance metrics from network pruning (specifically, we use the structural pruning method), and then perform fine-tuning by restricting to weights involving these neurons. Experiments on common language tasks show our method improves SpFT's memory efficiency by 20-50\% while matching the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods like LoRA's variants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Caifeng Zou, Zachary E. Ross, Robert W. Clayton, Fan-Chi Lin, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli</p>
<p>Abstract: Numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation are crucial for investigating velocity structures and improving seismic hazard assessment. However, standard methods such as finite difference or finite element are computationally expensive. Recent studies have shown that a new class of machine learning models, called neural operators, can solve the elastodynamic wave equation orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Full waveform inversion is a prime beneficiary of the accelerated simulations. Neural operators, as end-to-end differentiable operators, combined with automatic differentiation, provide an alternative approach to the adjoint-state method. State-of-the-art optimization techniques built into PyTorch provide neural operators with greater flexibility to improve the optimization dynamics of full waveform inversion, thereby mitigating cycle-skipping problems. In this study, we demonstrate the first application of neural operators for full waveform inversion on a real seismic dataset, which consists of several nodal transects collected across the San Gabriel, Chino, and San Bernardino basins in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</p>

<p>Abstract: El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts global climate and societal impacts, but real-time prediction with lead times beyond one year remains challenging. Dynamical models suffer from large biases and uncertainties, while deep learning struggles with interpretability and multi-scale dynamics. Here, we introduce PTSTnet, an interpretable model that unifies dynamical processes and cross-scale spatiotemporal learning in an innovative neural-network framework with physics-encoding learning. PTSTnet produces interpretable predictions significantly outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks with lead times beyond 24 months, providing physical insights into error propagation in ocean-atmosphere interactions. PTSTnet learns feature representations with physical consistency from sparse data to tackle inherent multi-scale and multi-physics challenges underlying ocean-atmosphere processes, thereby inherently enhancing long-term prediction skill. Our successful realizations mark substantial steps forward in interpretable insights into innovative neural ocean modelling.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22139">Time-resolved dynamic CBCT reconstruction using prior-model-free spatiotemporal Gaussian representation (PMF-STGR)</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Xie, Hua-Chieh Shao, You Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-resolved CBCT imaging, which reconstructs a dynamic sequence of CBCTs reflecting intra-scan motion (one CBCT per x-ray projection without phase sorting or binning), is highly desired for regular and irregular motion characterization, patient setup, and motion-adapted radiotherapy. Representing patient anatomy and associated motion fields as 3D Gaussians, we developed a Gaussian representation-based framework (PMF-STGR) for fast and accurate dynamic CBCT reconstruction. PMF-STGR comprises three major components: a dense set of 3D Gaussians to reconstruct a reference-frame CBCT for the dynamic sequence; another 3D Gaussian set to capture three-level, coarse-to-fine motion-basis-components (MBCs) to model the intra-scan motion; and a CNN-based motion encoder to solve projection-specific temporal coefficients for the MBCs. Scaled by the temporal coefficients, the learned MBCs will combine into deformation vector fields to deform the reference CBCT into projection-specific, time-resolved CBCTs to capture the dynamic motion. Due to the strong representation power of 3D Gaussians, PMF-STGR can reconstruct dynamic CBCTs in a 'one-shot' training fashion from a standard 3D CBCT scan, without using any prior anatomical or motion model. We evaluated PMF-STGR using XCAT phantom simulations and real patient scans. Metrics including the image relative error, structural-similarity-index-measure, tumor center-of-mass-error, and landmark localization error were used to evaluate the accuracy of solved dynamic CBCTs and motion. PMF-STGR shows clear advantages over a state-of-the-art, INR-based approach, PMF-STINR. Compared with PMF-STINR, PMF-STGR reduces reconstruction time by 50% while reconstructing less blurred images with better motion accuracy. With improved efficiency and accuracy, PMF-STGR enhances the applicability of dynamic CBCT imaging for potential clinical translation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxuan He, Yuan Gao, Liping Zhu, Jian Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Testing conditional independence between two random vectors given a third is a fundamental and challenging problem in statistics, particularly in multivariate nonparametric settings due to the complexity of conditional structures. We propose a novel method for testing conditional independence by transforming it to an unconditional independence test problem. We achieve this by constructing two transport maps that transform conditional independence into unconditional independence, this substantially simplifies the problem. These transport maps are estimated from data using conditional continuous normalizing flow models. Within this framework, we derive a test statistic and prove its asymptotic validity under both the null and alternative hypotheses. A permutation-based procedure is employed to evaluate the significance of the test. We validate the proposed method through extensive simulations and real-data analysis. Our numerical studies demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method for conditional independence</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Yao, Haixin Wang, Yibo Chen, Jiawen Wang, Min Chang Jordan Ren, Bosheng Ding, Salman Avestimehr, Chaoyang He</p>
<p>Abstract: AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through enormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This position paper presents a design of the Super Agent System powered by the hybrid AI routers. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.</p>

In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes. Our conversion process requires only 350-700M tokens, less than 0.005% of the token count used to train the original teacher models. Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license, with the exception of our 72B models which are also governed by the Qwen License Agreement.

<p>Abstract: Ensuring clinical data privacy while preserving utility is critical for AI-driven healthcare and data analytics. Existing de-identification (De-ID) methods, including rule-based techniques, deep learning models, and large language models (LLMs), often suffer from recall errors, limited generalization, and inefficiencies, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a fully automated, multi-modal framework, RedactOR for de-identifying structured and unstructured electronic health records, including clinical audio records. Our framework employs cost-efficient De-ID strategies, including intelligent routing, hybrid rule and LLM based approaches, and a two-step audio redaction approach. We present a retrieval-based entity relexicalization approach to ensure consistent substitutions of protected entities, thereby enhancing data coherence for downstream applications. We discuss key design desiderata, de-identification and relexicalization methodology, and modular architecture of RedactOR and its integration with the Oracle Health Clinical AI system. Evaluated on the i2b2 2014 De-ID dataset using standard metrics with strict recall, our approach achieves competitive performance while optimizing token usage to reduce LLM costs. Finally, we discuss key lessons and insights from deployment in real-world AI- driven healthcare data pipelines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Nova, Stephane Hess, Sander van Cranenburgh</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Delphos, a deep reinforcement learning framework for assisting the discrete choice model specification process. Unlike traditional approaches that treat model specification as a static optimisation problem, Delphos represents a paradigm shift: it frames this specification challenge as a sequential decision-making problem, formalised as a Markov Decision Process. In this setting, an agent learns to specify well-performing model candidates by choosing a sequence of modelling actions - such as selecting variables, accommodating both generic and alternative-specific taste parameters, applying non-linear transformations, and including interactions with covariates - and interacting with a modelling environment that estimates each candidate and returns a reward signal. Specifically, Delphos uses a Deep Q-Network that receives delayed rewards based on modelling outcomes (e.g., log-likelihood) and behavioural expectations (e.g., parameter signs), and distributes rewards across the sequence of actions to learn which modelling decisions lead to well-performing candidates. We evaluate Delphos on both simulated and empirical datasets, varying the size of the modelling space and the reward function. To assess the agent's performance in navigating the model space, we analyse the learning curve, the distribution of Q-values, occupancy metrics, and Pareto fronts. Our results show that the agent learns to adaptively explore strategies to identify well-performing models across search spaces, even without prior domain knowledge. It efficiently explores large modelling spaces, concentrates its search in high-reward regions, and suggests candidates that define Pareto frontiers balancing model fit and behavioural plausibility. These findings highlight the potential of this novel adaptive, learning-based framework to assist in the model specification process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Luxembourg, Haim Permuter, Eliya Nachmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Jahn, Frederick Eberhardt, Leonard J. Schulman</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made. The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior, Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed. Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random directed cyclic graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> He-Yang Xu, Hongxiang Gao, Yuwen Li, Xiu-Shen Wei, Chengyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pedro R. Pires, Tiago A. Almeida</p>
<p>Abstract: Over the past decade, recommender systems have experienced a surge in popularity. Despite notable progress, they grapple with challenging issues, such as high data dimensionality and sparseness. Representing users and items as low-dimensional embeddings learned via neural networks has become a leading solution. However, while recent studies show promising results, many approaches rely on complex architectures or require content data, which may not always be available. This paper presents Interact2Vec, a novel neural network-based model that simultaneously learns distributed embeddings for users and items while demanding only implicit feedback. The model employs state-of-the-art strategies that natural language processing models commonly use to optimize the training phase and enhance the final embeddings. Two types of experiments were conducted regarding the extrinsic and intrinsic quality of the model. In the former, we benchmarked the recommendations generated by Interact2Vec's embeddings in a top-$N$ ranking problem, comparing them with six other recommender algorithms. The model achieved the second or third-best results in 30% of the datasets, being competitive with other recommenders, and has proven to be very efficient with an average training time reduction of 274% compared to other embedding-based models. Later, we analyzed the intrinsic quality of the embeddings through similarity tables. Our findings suggest that Interact2Vec can achieve promising results, especially on the extrinsic task, and is an excellent embedding-generator model for scenarios of scarce computing resources, enabling the learning of item and user embeddings simultaneously and efficiently.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giwon Lee, Wooseong Jeong, Daehee Park, Jaewoo Jeong, Kuk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binyan Xu, Fan Yang, Xilin Dai, Di Tang, Kehuan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison training data to implant backdoor into the victim model. Current backdoor defenses on poisoned data often suffer from high computational costs or low effectiveness against advanced attacks like clean-label and clean-image backdoors. To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is compromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense scenarios. Code: https://github.com/binyxu/CGD.</p>

<p>Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency. Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called \emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> K. Sahit Reddy, N. Ragavenderan, Vasanth K., Ganesh N. Naik, Vishalakshi Prabhu, Nagaraja G. S</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5, despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing domain-specific information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchi Tang, I\~naki Esnaola, George Panoutsos</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision", "federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and visualization-friendly explanations. This work represents a step toward the trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger theoretical grounding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Poole</p>
<p>Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15264">On exploration of an interior mirror descent flow for stochastic nonconvex constrained problem</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuangyu Ding, Kim-Chuan Toh</p>
<p>Abstract: We study a nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem defined over nonconvex constraints, where the feasible set is given by the intersection of the closure of an open set and a smooth manifold. By endowing the open set with a Riemannian metric induced by a barrier function, we obtain a Riemannian subgradient flow formulated as a differential inclusion, which remains strictly within the interior of the feasible set. This continuous dynamical system unifies two classes of iterative optimization methods, namely the Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme, by revealing that these methods can be interpreted as discrete approximations of the continuous flow. We explore the long-term behavior of the trajectories generated by this dynamical system and show that the existing deficient convergence properties of the Hessian barrier and mirror descent scheme can be unifily and more insightfully interpreted through these of the continuous trajectory. For instance, the notorious spurious stationary points \cite{chen2024spurious} observed in Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme are interpreted as stable equilibria of the dynamical system that do not correspond to real stationary points of the original optimization problem. We provide two sufficient condition such that these spurious stationary points can be avoided if the strict complementarity conditions holds. In the absence of these regularity condition, we propose a random perturbation strategy that ensures the trajectory converges (subsequentially) to an approximate stationary point. Building on these insights, we introduce two iterative Riemannian subgradient methods, form of interior point methods, that generalizes the existing Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme for solving nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Po-Yen Wu, Cheng-Yu Kuo, Yuki Kadokawa, Takamitsu Matsubara</p>
<p>Abstract: In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arindam Ghosh, Mark Fuhs, Bongjun Kim, Anurag Chowdhury, Monika Woszczyna</p>
<p>Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc. In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer, synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce small-word deletion errors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Semih Eren, Deniz Kucukahmetler, Nico Scherf</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Su, Weiwei Shang, Chen Qian, Fei Zhang, Shuang Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Jarry, Ramon Dalmau, Philippe Very, Franck Ballerini, Stefania-Denisa Bocu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.</p>
