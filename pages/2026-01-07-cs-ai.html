<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmad Terra, Mohit Ahmed, Rafia Inam, Elena Fersman, Martin T\"orngren</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy is crucial for ensuring that autonomous agents behave according to human expectations. This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02553">SimpleMem: Efficient Lifelong Memory for LLM Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaqi Liu, Yaofeng Su, Peng Xia, Siwei Han, Zeyu Zheng, Cihang Xie, Mingyu Ding, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: To support reliable long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that efficiently manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02577">Orchestral AI: A Framework for Agent Orchestration</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Roman, Jacob Roman</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeiyoon Park, Daehwan Lee, Changmin Yeo, Yongshin Han, Minseop Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite its efficiency, there has been little research on the practical aspects required for real-world deployment of on-device AI models, such as the device's CPU utilization and thermal conditions. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation. To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task. We expect that our findings will provide meaningful insights to the on-device AI community.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02643">AWARE-US: Benchmark for Preference-Aware Resolution in Tool-Calling Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Kurmaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool-calling conversational agents querying structured databases often face two linked failures: underspecification (missing constraints needed to run a precise query) and infeasibility (the fully specified query returns an empty set because no item satisfies all constraints). Existing work often responds with "no results" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hadi Partovi Aria, Zhe Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision-making tasks often unfold on graphs with spatial-temporal dynamics. Black-box reinforcement learning often overlooks how local changes spread through network structure, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability. We present GTL-CIRL, a closed-loop framework that simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic (Causal GTL) specifications. The method shapes rewards with robustness, collects counterexamples when effects fail, and uses Gaussian Process (GP) driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates. The GP models capture spatial and temporal correlations in the system dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. Case studies in gene and power networks show faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02683">Learning from Prompt itself: the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongyu Chen, Jian Ma, Xianpeng Zhang, Lei Zhang, Haonan Lu, Chen Chen, Chuangchuang Wang, Kai Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization is fundamental across numerous disciplines, typically following an iterative process of refining an initial solution to enhance performance. This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhaib Mehri, Priyanka Kargupta, Tal August, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: As conversational agents accumulate experience collaborating with users, adapting to user preferences is essential for fostering long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality over time. We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Finally, we conduct a human user study that demonstrates that memory helps improve user experience in real-world settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02714">Time-Scaling Is What Agents Need Now</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi Liu, Guangzhi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning." With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities.
  Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning. Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.
  This highlights the need for "Time-Scaling"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02749">The Path Ahead for Agentic AI: Challenges and Opportunities</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadia Sibai, Yara Ahmed, Serry Sibaee, Sawsan AlHalawani, Adel Ammar, Wadii Boulila</p>
<p>Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text generators to autonomous, goal-driven systems represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence. This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks. Responsible advancement requires simultaneous progress in technical robustness, interpretability, and ethical safeguards to realize potential while mitigating risks of misalignment and unintended consequences.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02757">LLM Agent Framework for Intelligent Change Analysis in Urban Environment using Remote Sensing Imagery</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Xiao, Jun Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing change detection methods often lack the versatility to handle diverse real-world queries and the intelligence for comprehensive analysis. This paper presents a general agent framework, integrating Large Language Models (LLM) with vision foundation models to form ChangeGPT. A hierarchical structure is employed to mitigate hallucination. The agent was evaluated on a curated dataset of 140 questions categorized by real-world scenarios, encompassing various question types (e.g., Size, Class, Number) and complexities. The evaluation assessed the agent's tool selection ability (Precision/Recall) and overall query accuracy (Match). ChangeGPT, especially with a GPT-4-turbo backend, demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 90.71 % Match rate. Its strength lies particularly in handling change-related queries requiring multi-step reasoning and robust tool selection. Practical effectiveness was further validated through a real-world urban change monitoring case study in Qianhai Bay, Shenzhen. By providing intelligence, adaptability, and multi-type change analysis, ChangeGPT offers a powerful solution for decision-making in remote sensing applications.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02813">HAL: Inducing Human-likeness in LLMs with Alignment</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Masum Hasan, Junjie Zhao, Ehsan Hoque</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duc Ngo, Arya Rahgoza</p>
<p>Abstract: Systematic reviews are essential for evidence-based medicine, but reviewing 1.5 million+ annual publications manually is infeasible. Current AI approaches suffer from hallucinations in systematic review tasks, with studies reporting rates ranging from 28--40% for earlier models to 2--15% for modern implementations which is unacceptable when errors impact patient care.
  We present a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system integrating explicit causal reasoning with dual-level knowledge graphs. Our approach enforces evidence-first protocols where every causal claim traces to retrieved literature and automatically generates directed acyclic graphs visualizing intervention-outcome pathways.
  Evaluation on 234 dementia exercise abstracts shows CausalAgent achieves 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations versus 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI. Automatic causal graphs enable explicit mechanism modeling, visual synthesis, and enhanced interpretability. While this proof-of-concept evaluation used ten questions focused on dementia exercise research, the architectural approach demonstrates transferable principles for trustworthy medical AI and causal reasoning's potential for high-stakes healthcare.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02818">Quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention for spatial permeability prediction in oilfield reservoirs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Muzhen Zhang, Yujie Cheng, Zhanxiang Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Celeste Veronese, Daniele Meli, Alessandro Farinelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: As an agent-level reasoning and coordination paradigm, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) orchestrates multiple agents through structured debate to improve answer quality and support complex reasoning. However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation. The code is available at http://github.com/liaolea/M3MAD-Bench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents play a pivotal role in recruitment, particularly for steering conversations towards specific business outcomes, such as acquiring social-media contacts for private-channel conversion. Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics. Finally, we train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset. Experiments in a real-world recruitment scenario demonstrate that SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, highlighting its practical value for industrial deployment and its potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek HS, Pavan C Shekar, Arpit Jain, Ashwanth Krishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-step reasoning remains a key challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in complex domains such as mathematics and creative writing. While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglang Zhang, Yunyao Zhang, ZeLiang Chen, Junqing Yu, Wei Yang, Zikai Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic logical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored capability of large language models (LLMs), providing reliable and verifiable decision-making in high-stakes domains such as mathematical reasoning and legal judgment. In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Yang, Furong Jia, Roy Xie, Xiong Xi, Hengwei Bian, Jian Li, Monica Agrawal</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Large Language Model reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals such as shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints. We introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free method that processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning. By performing comparative analysis across batches, BoT identifies high-quality reasoning templates, detects errors through consistency checks, and amortizes computational costs. We instantiate BoT within a multi-agent reflection architecture (BoT-R), where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing. Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks demonstrate that BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%. Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveals when and why batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingxiang Liu, Zhiqing Cui, Xiaoliang Luo, Yuqian Wu, Zhuoyang Jiang, Huaiyu Wan, Sheng Sun, Lvchun Wang, Wei Yu, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: The underperformance of existing multimodal large language models for time series reasoning lies in the absence of rationale priors that connect temporal observations to their downstream outcomes, which leads models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning. We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes. Then, we design the hybrid retrieval by balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for the final in-context inference on new samples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. We will release our code for reproduction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qusai Khaled, Pasquale De Marinis, Moez Louati, David Ferras, Laura Genga, Uzay Kaymak</p>
<p>Abstract: Timely leak detection in water distribution networks is critical for conserving resources and maintaining operational efficiency. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies. The code is available at github.com/pasqualedem/GNNLeakDetection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Keane, Nick Pepper, Chris Burr, Amy Hodgkin, Dewi Gould, John Korna, Marc Thomas</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital Twins combine simulation, operational data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and have the potential to bring significant benefits across the aviation industry. Project Bluebird, an industry-academic collaboration, has developed a probabilistic Digital Twin of en route UK airspace as an environment for training and testing AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) agents. There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case.
  We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin.
  The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case. An assurance case is a nested set of structured arguments that provides justified evidence for how a top-level goal has been realised. In this paper we provide an overview of each structured argument and a number of deep dives which elaborate in more detail upon particular arguments, including the required evidence, assumptions and justifications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenglin Yu, Yuchen Wang, Songmiao Wang, Hongxia Yang, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongming Jiang, Yi Li, Guanpeng Li, Bingzhe Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> I-Fan Lin, Faegheh Hasibi, Suzan Verberne</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free and label-free method for short text clustering that can be used on top of any existing embedder. In the context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning, but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM. These low-resource, adaptable settings and the scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world scenarios than existing clustering methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itzhak Ziv, Moshe Unger, Hilah Geva</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of generative AI technologies is reshaping content-based recommender systems (RSes), which increasingly encounter AI-generated content alongside human-authored content. This study examines how the introduction of AI-generated reviews influences RS performance and business outcomes. We analyze two distinct pathways through which AI content can enter RSes: user-centric, in which individuals use AI tools to refine their reviews, and platform-centric, in which platforms generate synthetic reviews directly from structured metadata. Using a large-scale dataset of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, we generate synthetic reviews using LLMs and evaluate their impact across the training and deployment phases of RSes. We find that AI-generated reviews differ systematically from human-authored reviews across multiple textual dimensions. Although both user- and platform-centric AI reviews enhance RS performance relative to models without textual data, models trained on human reviews consistently achieve superior performance, underscoring the quality of authentic human data. Human-trained models generalize robustly to AI content, whereas AI-trained models underperform on both content types. Furthermore, tone-based framing strategies (encouraging, constructive, or critical) substantially enhance platform-generated review effectiveness. Our findings highlight the strategic importance of platform control in governing the generation and integration of AI-generated reviews, ensuring that synthetic content complements recommendation robustness and sustainable business value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chung Park, Taesan Kim, Hyeongjun Yun, Dongjoon Hong, Junui Hong, Kijung Park, MinCheol Cho, Mira Myong, Jihoon Oh, Min sung Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional recommender systems (RS) have been primarily optimized for accuracy and short-term engagement, often overlooking transparency and trustworthiness. Recently, platforms such as Amazon and Instagram have begun providing recommendation rationales to users, acknowledging their critical role in fostering trust and enhancing engagement; however, most existing systems still treat them as post-hoc artifacts. We propose an LLM-based recommender (LLM-Rec) that not only predicts items but also generates logically grounded rationales. Our approach leverages a self-annotated rationale dataset and instruction tuning in a rationale-first format, where the model generates an explanation before outputting the recommended item. By adopting this strategy and representing rationales in a chain-of-thought (CoT) style, LLM-Rec strengthens both interpretability and recommendation performance. Experiments on the Fashion and Scientific domains of the Amazon Review dataset demonstrate significant improvements over well-established baselines. To encourage reproducibility and future research, we publicly release a rationale-augmented recommendation dataset containing user histories, rationales, and recommended items.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tushar Vatsa, Vibha Belavadi, Priya Shanmugasundaram, Suhas Suresha, Dewang Sultania</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal creative assistants decompose user goals and route tasks to subagents for layout, styling, retrieval, and generation. Retrieval quality is pivotal, yet failures can arise at several stages: understanding user intent, choosing content types, finding candidates (recall), or ranking results. Meanwhile, sending and processing images is costly, making naive multimodal approaches impractical. We present FUSE: Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation. FUSE replaces most raw-image prompting with a compact Grounded Design Representation (GDR): a selection aware JSON of canvas elements (image, text, shape, icon, video, logo), structure, styles, salient colors, and user selection provided by the Planner team. FUSE implements seven context budgeting strategies: comprehensive baseline prompting, context compression, chain-of-thought reasoning, mini-shot optimization, retrieval-augmented context, two-stage processing, and zero-shot minimalism. Finally, a pipeline attribution layer monitors system performance by converting subagent signals into simple checks: intent alignment, content-type/routing sanity, recall health (e.g., zero-hit and top-match strength), and ranking displacement analysis. We evaluate the seven context budgeting variants across 788 evaluation queries from diverse users and design templates (refer Figure 3). Our systematic evaluation reveals that Context Compression achieves optimal performance across all pipeline stages, with 93.3% intent accuracy, 86.8% routing success(with fallbacks), 99.4% recall, and 88.5% NDCG@5. This approach demonstrates that strategic context summarization outperforms both comprehensive and minimal contextualization strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiwen Chen, Yiqing Wu, Huishi Luo, Fuzhen Zhuang, Deqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-based recommendation has achieved great success in recent years. The classical graph recommendation model utilizes ID embedding to store essential collaborative information. However, this ID-based paradigm faces challenges in transferring to a new domain, making it hard to build a pre-trained graph recommendation model. This phenomenon primarily stems from two inherent challenges: (1) the non-transferability of ID embeddings due to isolated domain-specific ID spaces, and (2) structural incompatibility between heterogeneous interaction graphs across domains.
  To address these issues, we propose TextBridgeGNN, a pre-training and fine-tuning framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from a pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks. We believe the key lies in how to build the relationship between domains. Specifically, TextBridgeGNN uses text as a semantic bridge to connect domains through multi-level graph propagation. During the pre-training stage, textual information is utilized to break the data islands formed by multiple domains, and hierarchical GNNs are designed to learn both domain-specific and domain-global knowledge with text features, ensuring the retention of collaborative signals and the enhancement of semantics. During the fine-tuning stage, a similarity transfer mechanism is proposed. This mechanism initializes ID embeddings in the target domain by transferring from semantically related nodes, successfully transferring the ID embeddings and graph pattern.
  Experiments demonstrate that TextBridgeGNN outperforms existing methods in cross-domain, multi-domain, and training-free settings, highlighting its ability to integrate Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-driven semantics with graph-based collaborative filtering without costly language model fine-tuning or real-time inference overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Despoina Antonakaki, Sotiris Ioannidis</p>
<p>Abstract: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most polarizing geopolitical issues, with the October 2023 escalation intensifying online debate. Social media platforms, particularly Telegram, have become central to real-time news sharing, advocacy, and propaganda. In this study, we analyze Telegram, Twitter/X, and Reddit to examine how conflict narratives are produced, amplified, and contested across different digital spheres. Building on our previous work on Telegram discourse during the 2023 escalation, we extend the analysis longitudinally and cross-platform using an updated dataset spanning October 2023 to mid-2025. The corpus includes more than 187,000 Telegram messages, 2.1 million Reddit comments, and curated Twitter/X posts. We combine Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and transformer-based sentiment and emotion models to identify dominant themes, emotional dynamics, and propaganda strategies. Telegram channels provide unfiltered, high-intensity documentation of events; Twitter/X amplifies frames to global audiences; and Reddit hosts more reflective and deliberative discussions. Our findings reveal persistent negative sentiment, strong coupling between humanitarian framing and solidarity expressions, and platform-specific pathways for the diffusion of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli narratives. This paper offers three contributions: (1) a multi-platform, FAIR-compliant dataset on the Israel-Hamas war, (2) an integrated pipeline combining topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, and spam filtering for large-scale conflict discourse, and (3) empirical insights into how platform affordances and affective publics shape the evolution of digital conflict communication.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-scenario recommendation is pivotal for optimizing user experience across diverse contexts. While Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMOE) thrives in ranking, its transfer to the matching stage is hindered by the blind optimization inherent to independent two-tower architectures and the parameter dominance of head scenarios. To address these structural and distributional bottlenecks, we propose Distillation-based Scenario-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (DSMOE). Specially, we devise a Scenario-Adaptive Projection (SAP) module to generate lightweight, context-specific parameters, effectively preventing expert collapse in long-tail scenarios. Concurrently, we introduce a cross-architecture knowledge distillation framework, where an interaction-aware teacher guides the two-tower student to capture complex matching patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate DSMOE's superiority, particularly in significantly improving retrieval quality for under-represented, data-sparse scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents represents a significant shift in automated interactions with the web. Unlike traditional crawlers that follow simple conventions, such as robots.txt, modern agents engage with websites in sophisticated ways: navigating complex interfaces, extracting structured information, and completing end-to-end tasks. Existing governance mechanisms were not designed for these capabilities. Without a way to specify what interactions are and are not allowed, website owners increasingly rely on blanket blocking and CAPTCHAs, which undermine beneficial applications such as efficient automation, convenient use of e-commerce services, and accessibility tools. We introduce agent-permissions.json, a robots.txt-style lightweight manifest where websites specify allowed interactions, complemented by API references where available. This framework provides a low-friction coordination mechanism: website owners only need to write a simple JSON file, while agents can easily parse and automatically implement the manifest's provisions. Website owners can then focus on blocking non-compliant agents, rather than agents as a whole. By extending the spirit of robots.txt to the era of LLM-mediated interaction, and complementing data use initiatives such as AIPref, the manifest establishes a compliance framework that enables beneficial agent interactions while respecting site owners' preferences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biological systems exhibit a continuous stream of movements, consisting of sequential segments, that allow them to perform complex tasks in a creative and versatile fashion. This observation has led researchers towards identifying elementary building blocks of motion known as movement primitives, which are well-suited for generating motor commands in autonomous systems, such as robots. In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics. Specifically, we aim to (i) present a systematic review of major movement primitive frameworks and examine their strengths and weaknesses; (ii) highlight applications that have successfully made use of movement primitives; and (iii) examine open questions and discuss practical challenges when applying movement primitives in robotics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elchanan Mossel</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reports claim that Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved the ability to derive new science and exhibit human-level general intelligence. We argue that such claims are not rigorous scientific claims, as they do not satisfy Popper's refutability principle (often termed falsifiability), which requires that scientific statements be capable of being disproven. We identify several methodological pitfalls in current AI research on reasoning, including the inability to verify the novelty of findings due to opaque and non-searchable training data, the lack of reproducibility caused by continuous model updates, and the omission of human-interaction transcripts, which obscures the true source of scientific discovery. Additionally, the absence of counterfactuals and data on failed attempts creates a selection bias that may exaggerate LLM capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose guidelines for scientific transparency and reproducibility for research on reasoning by LLMs. Establishing such guidelines is crucial for both scientific integrity and the ongoing societal debates regarding fair data usage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Conger, Nathan Scollar, Kemal Davaslioglu, Yalin E. Sagduyu, Sastry Kompella</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a retrieval-augmented question answering framework for 5G/6G networks, where the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become central to disaggregated, virtualized, and AI-driven wireless systems. While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammed Mallik, Guillaume Villemaud</p>
<p>Abstract: As 5G networks rapidly expand and 6G technologies emerge, characterized by dense deployments, millimeter-wave communications, and dynamic beamforming, the need for scalable simulation tools becomes increasingly critical. These tools must support efficient evaluation of key performance metrics such as coverage and radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure, inform network design decisions, and ensure compliance with safety regulations. Moreover, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the network design, where satisfying coverage requirements is essential. To address these, based on our previous work, we first propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that predicts location specific received signal strength (RSS), and EMF exposure simultaneously from the network topology, as images. As a network designing application, we propose a Deep Q Network (DQN) framework, using the trained cGAN, for optimal base station (BS) deployment in the network. Compared to conventional ray tracing simulations, the proposed cGAN reduces inference and deployment time from several hours to seconds. Unlike a standalone cGAN, which provides static performance maps, the proposed GAN-DQN framework enables sequential decision making under coverage and exposure constraints, learning effective deployment strategies that directly solve the BS placement problem. Thus making it well suited for real time design and adaptation in dynamic scenarios in order to satisfy pre defined network specific heterogeneous performance goals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Yuan, Ning Tang, Tongya Zheng, Jiarong Xu, Xintong Hu, Renhong Huang, Shunyu Liu, Jiacong Hu, Jiawei Chen, Mingli Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Diversified recommendation has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners, which can effectively address the homogeneity of recommended items. Existing approaches predominantly aim to infer the diversity of user preferences from observed user feedback. Nonetheless, due to inherent data biases, the observed data may not fully reflect user interests, where underexplored preferences can be overwhelmed or remain unmanifested. Failing to capture these preferences can lead to suboptimal diversity in recommendations. To fill this gap, this work aims to study diversified recommendation from a data-bias perspective. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot inference leveraging world knowledge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes LLMs' expertise to uncover underexplored user preferences from observed behavior, ultimately providing diverse and relevant recommendations. To achieve this, we first introduce Tree of Preferences (ToP), an innovative structure constructed to model user preferences from coarse to fine. ToP enables LLMs to systematically reason over the user's rationale behind their behavior, thereby uncovering their underexplored preferences. To guide diversified recommendations using uncovered preferences, we adopt a data-centric approach, identifying candidate items that match user preferences and generating synthetic interactions that reflect underexplored preferences. These interactions are integrated to train a general recommender for diversification. Moreover, we scale up overall efficiency by dynamically selecting influential users during optimization. Extensive evaluations of both diversity and relevance show that our approach outperforms existing methods in most cases and achieves near-optimal performance in others, with reasonable inference latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Coronary calcification creates blooming artifacts in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), severely hampering the diagnosis of lumen stenosis. While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry. This forces the encoder to learn high-level latent features of arterial topology without human annotation. Experimental results on clinical CTA datasets demonstrate that initializing the Calcium Removal network with our MAE-based weights significantly improves inpainting accuracy and stenosis estimation compared to training from scratch, specifically in few-shot scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Zhang, M. Feizarefi, A. F. Mirzaei</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is emerging as a foundational paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, enabling communication infrastructures to simultaneously support data transmission and environment sensing. By tightly coupling radio sensing with communication functions, ISAC unlocks new capabilities for situational awareness, localization, tracking, and network adaptation. At the same time, the increasing scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics of future wireless systems demand self-organizing network intelligence capable of autonomously managing resources, topology, and services. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly learning-driven and data-centric methods, has become a key enabler for realizing this vision. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level review of AI-native ISAC-enabled self-organizing wireless networks. We develop a unified taxonomy that spans: (i) ISAC signal models and sensing modalities, (ii) network state abstraction and perception from sensing-aware radio data, (iii) learning-driven self-organization mechanisms for resource allocation, topology control, and mobility management, and (iv) cross-layer architectures integrating sensing, communication, and network intelligence. We further examine emerging learning paradigms, including deep reinforcement learning, graph-based learning, multi-agent coordination, and federated intelligence that enable autonomous adaptation under uncertainty, mobility, and partial observability. Practical considerations such as sensing-communication trade-offs, scalability, latency, reliability, and security are discussed alongside representative evaluation methodologies and performance metrics. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions toward deployable, trustworthy, and scalable AI-native ISAC systems for 6G and beyond.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal agents are making rapid progress on general computer-use tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain largely confined to browsers and basic desktop applications, falling short in professional software workflows that dominate real-world scientific and industrial practice. To close this gap, we introduce ProSoftArena, a benchmark and platform specifically for evaluating multimodal agents in professional software environments. We establish the first capability hierarchy tailored to agent use of professional software and construct a benchmark of 436 realistic work and research tasks spanning 6 disciplines and 13 core professional applications. To ensure reliable and reproducible assessment, we build an executable real-computer environment with an execution-based evaluation framework and uniquely incorporate a human-in-the-loop evaluation paradigm. Extensive experiments show that even the best-performing agent attains only a 24.4\% success rate on L2 tasks and completely fails on L3 multi-software workflow. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents in professional software settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Inpyo Song, Eunji Jeon, Jangwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, including software development, education, and technical assistance. Among these, software development is one of the key areas where LLMs are increasingly adopted. However, when hardware constraints are considered-for instance, in physical computing, where software must interact with and control physical hardware -their effectiveness has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{PCEval} (Physical Computing Evaluation), the first benchmark in physical computing that enables a fully automatic evaluation of the capabilities of LLM in both the logical and physical aspects of the projects, without requiring human assessment. Our evaluation framework assesses LLMs in generating circuits and producing compatible code across varying levels of project complexity. Through comprehensive testing of 13 leading models, \textsc{PCEval} provides the first reproducible and automatically validated empirical assessment of LLMs' ability to reason about fundamental hardware implementation constraints within a simulation environment. Our findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in code generation and logical circuit design, they struggle significantly with physical breadboard layout creation, particularly in managing proper pin connections and avoiding circuit errors. \textsc{PCEval} advances our understanding of AI assistance in hardware-dependent computing environments and establishes a foundation for developing more effective tools to support physical computing education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longwei Wang, Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin, KC Santosh</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image analysis faces two critical challenges: scarcity of labeled data and lack of model interpretability, both hindering clinical AI deployment. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses data limitations but lacks transparency in predictions. Active learning (AL) methods optimize data acquisition but overlook interpretability of acquired samples. We propose a dual-framework solution: Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning (EGxFSL) and Explainability-Guided AL (xGAL). EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification for interpretable few-shot learning. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically. On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\%, 76\%, and 62\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieves 76\% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57\% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate guided models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with generalization validated on breast ultrasound confirming cross-modality applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aizierjiang Aiersilan</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering education has driven the emergence of ``Vibe Coding,'' a paradigm where developers articulate high-level intent through natural language and delegate implementation to AI agents. While proponents argue this approach modernizes pedagogy by emphasizing conceptual design over syntactic memorization, accumulating empirical evidence raises concerns regarding skill retention and deep conceptual understanding. This paper proposes a theoretical framework to investigate the research question: \textit{Is Vibe Coding a better way to learn software engineering?} We posit a divergence in student outcomes between those leveraging AI for acceleration versus those using it for cognitive offloading. To evaluate these educational trade-offs, we propose the \textbf{Vibe-Check Protocol (VCP)}, a systematic benchmarking framework incorporating three quantitative metrics: the \textit{Cold Start Refactor} ($M_{CSR}$) for modeling skill decay; \textit{Hallucination Trap Detection} ($M_{HT}$) based on signal detection theory to evaluate error identification; and the \textit{Explainability Gap} ($E_{gap}$) for quantifying the divergence between code complexity and conceptual comprehension. Through controlled comparisons, VCP aims to provide a quantitative basis for educators to determine the optimal pedagogical boundary: identifying contexts where Vibe Coding fosters genuine mastery and contexts where it introduces hidden technical debt and superficial competence.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02411">SpikySpace: A Spiking State Space Model for Energy-Efficient Time Series Forecasting</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiwen Tang, Jiaqi Zheng, Yuze Jin, Yupeng Qiu, Guangda Sun, Zhanglu Yan, Weng-Fai Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting often operates under tight power and latency budgets in fields like traffic management, industrial condition monitoring, and on-device sensing. These applications frequently require near real-time responses and low energy consumption on edge devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power by exploiting temporal sparsity and multiplication-free computation. Yet existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often inherit complex transformer blocks, thereby losing much of the efficiency benefit. To solve the problem, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via selective scanning. Further, we replace dense SSM updates with sparse spike trains and execute selective scans only on spike events, thereby avoiding dense multiplications while preserving the SSM's structured memory. Because complex operations such as exponentials and divisions are costly on neuromorphic chips, we introduce simplified approximations of SiLU and Softplus to enable a neuromorphic-friendly model architecture. In matched settings, SpikySpace reduces estimated energy consumption by 98.73% and 96.24% compared to two state-of-the-art transformer based approaches, namely iTransformer and iSpikformer, respectively. In standard time series forecasting datasets, SpikySpace delivers competitive accuracy while substantially reducing energy cost and memory traffic. As the first full spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, marking a practical and scalable path toward efficient time series forecasting systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Sch\"uepp, Carmen Amo Alonso, Florian D\"orfler, Giulia De Pasquale</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems shape online interactions by matching users with creators content to maximize engagement. Creators, in turn, adapt their content to align with users preferences and enhance their popularity. At the same time, users preferences evolve under the influence of both suggested content from the recommender system and content shared within their social circles. This feedback loop generates a complex interplay between users, creators, and recommender algorithms, which is the key cause of filter bubbles and opinion polarization. We develop a social network-aware recommender system that explicitly accounts for this user-creators feedback interaction and strategically exploits the topology of the user's own social network to promote diversification. Our approach highlights how accounting for and exploiting user's social network in the recommender system design is crucial to mediate filter bubble effects while balancing content diversity with personalization. Provably, opinion clusterization is positively correlated with the influence of recommended content on user opinions. Ultimately, the proposed approach shows the power of socially-aware recommender systems in combating opinion polarization and clusterization phenomena.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to perceive human emotions through three modes: language, vision, and audio. Previous methods primarily focused on modal fusion without adequately addressing significant distributional differences among modalities or considering their varying contributions to the task. They also lacked robust generalization capabilities across diverse textual model features, thus limiting performance in multimodal scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies. We conduct experiments on two benchmarks: CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, experimental results demonstrate the MIAR outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wangyuan Zhu, Jun Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is a key technology in the fields of human-computer interaction and affective computing. Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multi-modal reasoning requires the seamless integration of visual and linguistic cues, yet existing Chain-of-Thought methods suffer from two critical limitations in cross-modal scenarios: (1) over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions, and (2) semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) frame- work, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively align- ing visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual rea- soning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

<p>Abstract: The synthesis of nanocrystals has been highly dependent on trial-and-error, due to the complex correlation between synthesis parameters and physicochemical properties. Although deep learning offers a potential methodology to achieve generative inverse design, it is still hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align nanocrystal synthesis routes with their properties. Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts. Our work bridges the gap between unstructured literature and data-driven synthesis, and also establishes a powerful human-AI collaborative paradigm for accelerating nanocrystal discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Okan Bursa</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce \emph{Adaptive RAG Memory} (ARM), a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that replaces a static vector index with a \emph{dynamic} memory substrate governed by selective remembrance and decay. Frequently retrieved items are consolidated and protected from forgetting, while rarely used items gradually decay, inspired by cognitive consolidation and forgetting principles. On a lightweight retrieval benchmark, ARM reaches near state-of-the-art performance (e.g., NDCG@5 $\approx$ 0.940, Recall@5 $=1.000$) with only $\sim$22M parameters in the embedding layer, achieving the best efficiency among ultra-efficient models ($<$25M parameters). In addition, we compare static vs. dynamic RAG combinations across Llama 3.1 and GPT-4o. Llama 3.1 with static RAG achieves the highest key-term coverage (67.2\%) at moderate latency, while GPT-4o with a dynamic selective retrieval policy attains the fastest responses (8.2s on average) with competitive coverage (58.7\%). We further present an engineering optimization of the DynamicRAG implementation, making embedding weights configurable, adjustable at runtime, and robust to invalid settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxu Liu, Yingjie Fu, Wei Yang, Ying Zhang, Tao Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Web applications (web apps) have become a key arena for large language models (LLMs) to demonstrate their code generation capabilities and commercial potential. However, building a benchmark for LLM-generated web apps remains challenging due to the need for real-world user requirements, generalizable evaluation metrics without relying on ground-truth implementations or test cases, and interpretable evaluation results. To address these challenges, we introduce WebCoderBench, the first real-world-collected, generalizable, and interpretable benchmark for web app generation. WebCoderBench comprises 1,572 real user requirements, covering diverse modalities and expression styles that reflect realistic user intentions. WebCoderBench provides 24 fine-grained evaluation metrics across 9 perspectives, combining rule-based and LLM-as-a-judge paradigm for fully automated, objective, and general evaluation. Moreover, WebCoderBench adopts human-preference-aligned weights over metrics to yield interpretable overall scores. Experiments across 12 representative LLMs and 2 LLM-based agents show that there exists no dominant model across all evaluation metrics, offering an opportunity for LLM developers to optimize their models in a targeted manner for a more powerful version.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhibo Wang, Zuoyuan Zhang, Xiaoyi Pang, Qile Zhang, Xuanyi Hao, Shuguo Zhuo, Peng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision tasks, yet their substantial computational and memory demands hinder efficient deployment on resource-constrained mobile and edge devices. Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Bian, Yi Chen, HaiQuan Wang, ShiHao Li, Zhe Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Software vulnerability detection is a critical task for securing software systems and can be formulated as a binary classification problem: given a code snippet, determine whether it contains a vulnerability. Existing multimodal approaches typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations from pretrained language models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations from graph neural networks, often under the implicit assumption that adding a modality necessarily yields extra information. In practice, sequence and graph representations can be redundant, and fluctuations in the quality of the graph modality can dilute the discriminative signal of the dominant modality. To address this, we propose TaCCS-DFA, a framework that introduces Fisher information as a geometric measure of how sensitive feature directions are to the classification decision, enabling task-oriented complementary fusion. TaCCS-DFA online estimates a low-rank principal Fisher subspace and restricts cross-modal attention to task-sensitive directions, thereby retrieving structural features from CPG that complement the sequence modality; meanwhile, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of the graph modality for each sample to suppress noise propagation. Our analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, the proposed mechanism admits a tighter risk bound than conventional full-spectrum attention. Experiments on BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal show that TaCCS-DFA achieves strong performance across multiple backbones. With CodeT5 as the backbone, TaCCS-DFA reaches an F1 score of 87.80\% on the highly imbalanced BigVul dataset, improving over a strong baseline Vul-LMGNNs by 6.3 percentage points while maintaining low calibration error and computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungi Lee, Jungkwon Kim, Chi Zhang, Sangmin Kim, Kwangsun Yoo, Seok-Joo Byun</p>
<p>Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in industrial applications for identifying rare and unseen patterns to ensure system reliability. Traditional models, trained on a single class of normal data, struggle with real-world distributions where normal data exhibit diverse patterns, leading to class imbalance and long-tailed anomaly score distributions (LTD). This imbalance skews model training and degrades detection performance, especially for minority instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel importance-weighted loss designed specifically for anomaly detection. Compared to the previous method for LTD in classification, our method does not require prior knowledge of normal data classes. Instead, we introduce a weighted loss function that incorporates importance sampling to align the distribution of anomaly scores with a target Gaussian, ensuring a balanced representation of normal data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark image datasets and three real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach in mitigating LTD-induced bias. Our method improves anomaly detection performance by 0.043, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Li, Shin'ya Nishida</p>
<p>Abstract: Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Li Wang, Xi Chen, XiangWen Deng, HuaHui Yi, ZeKun Jiang, Kang Li, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising performance on medical visual question answering (VQA) and report generation, but these generation and explanation abilities do not reliably transfer to disease-specific classification. We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maryam Abbasihafshejani, AHM Nazmus Sakib, Murtuza Jadliwala</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech synthesis technologies, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), has intensified security and privacy concerns related to voice cloning. Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied.
  Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech. Our findings demonstrate the fragility of current perturbation-based defenses and highlight the need for more robust protection mechanisms against evolving voice-cloning and speaker verification threats.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subhankar Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing in deep architectures and expressiveness bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test. We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mhc)~\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-\gamma)^{L/n}$ vs.\ $(1-\gamma)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\% performance degradation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saba Naqvi, Mohammad Baqar, Nawaz Ali Mohammad</p>
<p>Abstract: Software testing has progressed toward intelligent automation, yet current AI-based test generators still suffer from static, single-shot outputs that frequently produce invalid, redundant, or non-executable tests due to the lack of execution aware feedback. This paper introduces an agentic multi-model testing framework a closed-loop, self-correcting system in which a Test Generation Agent, an Execution and Analysis Agent, and a Review and Optimization Agent collaboratively generate, execute, analyze, and refine tests until convergence. By using sandboxed execution, detailed failure reporting, and iterative regeneration or patching of failing tests, the framework autonomously improves test quality and expands coverage. Integrated into a CI/CD-compatible pipeline, it leverages reinforcement signals from coverage metrics and execution outcomes to guide refinement. Empirical evaluations on microservice based applications show up to a 60% reduction in invalid tests, 30% coverage improvement, and significantly reduced human effort compared to single-model baselines demonstrating that multi-agent, feedback-driven loops can evolve software testing into an autonomous, continuously learning quality assurance ecosystem for self-healing, high-reliability codebases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally costly, motivating Continual Learning (CL) approaches that utilize parameter-efficient adapters. We revisit Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace and introduce I-GEM: a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection. By constraining non-interference solely within the adapter parameters, I-GEM preserves GEM-like stability with orders-of-magnitude lower mean projection overhead. On a 3-task AG News split with induced domain drift, using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA ($r=8$), I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within $\sim\!0.04$ pts) and outperforms A-GEM by $\sim\!1.4$ pts. Crucially, it reduces projection time vs.\ GEM by a factor of $\sim\!10^3$. These results suggest that applying GEM constraints in the LoRA subspace is a practical pathway for continual learning at the LLM scale.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cooking recipes are complex procedures that require not only a fluent and factual text, but also accurate timing, temperature, and procedural coherence, as well as the correct composition of ingredients. Standard training procedures are primarily based on cross-entropy and focus solely on fluency. Building on RECIPE-NLG, we investigate the use of several composite objectives and present a new topological loss that represents ingredient lists as point clouds in embedding space, minimizing the divergence between predicted and gold ingredients. Using both standard NLG metrics and recipe-specific metrics, we find that our loss significantly improves ingredient- and action-level metrics. Meanwhile, the Dice loss excels in time/temperature precision, and the mixed loss yields competitive trade-offs with synergistic gains in quantity and time. A human preference analysis supports our finding, showing our model is preferred in 62% of the cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeong Kyu Choi, Sharon Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting a single high-quality output from multiple stochastic generations remains a fundamental challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in open-ended tasks where no canonical answer exists. While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models. We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX--Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency. Across open-ended tasks--including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning--our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.</p>

<p>Abstract: Credit risk assessment is essential in the financial sector, but has traditionally depended on costly feature-based models that often fail to utilize all available information in raw credit records. This paper introduces LendNova, the first practical automated end-to-end pipeline for credit risk assessment, designed to utilize all available information in raw credit records by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and language models. LendNova transforms risk modeling by operating directly on raw, jargon-heavy credit bureau text using a language model that learns task-relevant representations without manual feature engineering. By automatically capturing patterns and risk signals embedded in the text, it replaces manual preprocessing steps, reducing costs and improving scalability. Evaluation on real-world data further demonstrates its strong potential in accurate and efficient risk assessment. LendNova establishes a baseline for intelligent credit risk agents, demonstrating the feasibility of language models in this domain. It lays the groundwork for future research toward foundation systems that enable more accurate, adaptable, and automated financial decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Wang, Maryam Khalid, Qiong Wu, Jian Gao, Cheng Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring factual accuracy, yet their outputs often contain hallucinated responses. While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional methods for determining assessment item parameters, such as difficulty and discrimination, rely heavily on expensive field testing to collect student performance data for Item Response Theory (IRT) calibration. This study introduces a novel approach that implicitly models these psychometric properties by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate student responses across a spectrum of latent abilities. Leveraging the Qwen-3 dense model series and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we train models to generate responses to multiple choice questions conditioned on discrete ability descriptors. We reconstruct the probability of a correct response as a function of student ability, effectively generating synthetic Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) to estimate IRT parameters. Evaluation on a dataset of Grade 6 English Language Arts (ELA) items and the BEA 2024 Shared Task dataset demonstrates that this method competes with or outperforms baseline approaches. This simulation-based technique seems particularly effective at modeling item discrimination.</p>

<p>Abstract: Over 3.5 million patents are filed annually, with drafting patent descriptions requiring deep technical and legal expertise. Transforming scientific papers into patent descriptions is particularly challenging due to their differing rhetorical styles and stringent legal requirements. Unlike black-box text-to-text approaches that struggle to model structural reasoning and legal constraints, we propose FlowPlan-G2P, a novel framework that mirrors the cognitive workflow of expert drafters by reformulating this task into three stages: (1) Concept Graph Induction, extracting technical entities and relationships into a directed graph via expert-like reasoning; (2) Paragraph and Section Planning, reorganizing the graph into coherent clusters aligned with canonical patent sections; and (3) Graph-Conditioned Generation, producing legally compliant paragraphs using section-specific subgraphs and tailored prompts. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPlan-G2P significantly improves logical coherence and legal compliance over end-to-end LLM baselines.

<p>Abstract: Solving inverse problems in imaging requires models that support efficient inference, uncertainty quantification, and principled probabilistic reasoning. Energy-Based Models (EBMs), with their interpretable energy landscapes and compositional structure, are well-suited for this task but have historically suffered from high computational costs and training instability. To overcome the historical shortcomings of EBMs, we introduce a fast distillation strategy to transfer the strengths of pre-trained diffusion models into multi-scale EBMs. These distilled EBMs enable efficient sampling and preserve the interpretability and compositionality inherent to potential-based frameworks. Leveraging EBM compositionality, we propose Annealed Langevin Posterior Sampling (ALPS) algorithm for Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), and uncertainty estimates for inverse problems in imaging. Unlike diffusion models that use complex guidance strategies for latent variables, we perform annealing on static posterior distributions that are well-defined and composable. Experiments on image inpainting and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, while also supporting MAP recovery. Overall, our framework offers a scalable and principled solution for inverse problems in imaging, with potential for practical deployment in scientific and clinical settings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiyang Li, Zheyuan Zhang, Tianyi Ma, Zehong Wang, Keerthiram Murugesan, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce LongDA, a data analysis benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents under documentation-intensive analytical workflows. In contrast to existing benchmarks that assume well-specified schemas and inputs, LongDA targets real-world settings in which navigating long documentation and complex data is the primary bottleneck. To this end, we manually curate raw data files, long and heterogeneous documentation, and expert-written publications from 17 publicly available U.S. national surveys, from which we extract 505 analytical queries grounded in real analytical practice. Solving these queries requires agents to first retrieve and integrate key information from multiple unstructured documents, before performing multi-step computations and writing executable code, which remains challenging for existing data analysis agents. To support the systematic evaluation under this setting, we develop LongTA, a tool-augmented agent framework that enables document access, retrieval, and code execution, and evaluate a range of proprietary and open-source models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps even among state-of-the-art models, highlighting the challenges researchers should consider before applying LLM agents for decision support in real-world, high-stakes analytical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arjun S. Nair</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning is bottlenecked by memory: a 7B parameter model requires 84GB--14GB for weights, 14GB for gradients, and 56GB for FP32 optimizer states--exceeding even A100-40GB capacity. We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.
  On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB, Chronicals achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning versus Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x). For LoRA at rank 32, we reach 11,699 tokens/second versus Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/second (4.10x). Critically, we discovered that Unsloth's reported 46,000 tokens/second benchmark exhibited zero gradient norms--the model was not training.
  We provide complete mathematical foundations: online softmax correctness proofs, FlashAttention IO complexity bounds O(N^2 d^2 M^{-1}), LoRA+ learning rate derivations from gradient magnitude analysis, and bin-packing approximation guarantees.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aakash Sarkar, Marc W. Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: Human cognition integrates information across nested timescales. While the cortex exhibits hierarchical Temporal Receptive Windows (TRWs), local circuits often display heterogeneous time constants. To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales. These results suggest the brain employs scale-invariant, sequential priors - coding "what" happened "when" - making recurrent networks with such priors particularly well-suited to describe human cognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Ajoad Hasan, Dipayan Saha, Khan Thamid Hasan, Nashmin Alam, Azim Uddin, Sujan Kumar Saha, Mark Tehranipoor, Farimah Farahmandi</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing complexity of modern system-on-chip (SoC) and IP designs is making security assurance difficult day by day. One of the fundamental steps in the pre-silicon security verification of a hardware design is the identification of security assets, as it substantially influences downstream security verification tasks, such as threat modeling, security property generation, and vulnerability detection. Traditionally, assets are determined manually by security experts, requiring significant time and expertise. To address this challenge, we present LAsset, a novel automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify security assets from both hardware design specifications and register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions. The framework performs structural and semantic analysis to identify intra-module primary and secondary assets and derives inter-module relationships to systematically characterize security dependencies at the design level. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves high classification accuracy, reaching up to 90% recall rate in SoC design, and 93% recall rate in IP designs. This automation in asset identification significantly reduces manual overhead and supports a scalable path forward for secure hardware development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nelvin Tan, Yaowen Zhang, James Asikin Cheung, Fusheng Liu, Yu-Ching Shih, Dong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful in many domains due to their impressive abilities that arise from large training datasets and large model sizes. However, research on LLM-based approaches to document inconsistency detection is relatively limited. There are two key aspects of document inconsistency detection: (i) classification of whether there exists any inconsistency, and (ii) providing evidence of the inconsistent sentences. We focus on the latter, and introduce new comprehensive evidence-extraction metrics and a redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering that substantially improves LLM-based document inconsistency detection over direct prompting. We back our claims with promising experimental results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alireza Ezaz, Ghazal Khodabandeh, Majid Babaei, Naser Ezzati-Jivan</p>
<p>Abstract: Execution traces are a critical source of information for understanding, debugging, and optimizing complex software systems. However, traces from OS kernels or large-scale applications like Chrome or MySQL are massive and difficult to analyze. Existing tools rely on predefined analyses, and custom insights often require writing domain-specific scripts, which is an error-prone and time-consuming task. This paper introduces TAAF (Trace Abstraction and Analysis Framework), a novel approach that combines time-indexing, knowledge graphs (KGs), and large language models (LLMs) to transform raw trace data into actionable insights. TAAF constructs a time-indexed KG from trace events to capture relationships among entities such as threads, CPUs, and system resources. An LLM then interprets query-specific subgraphs to answer natural-language questions, reducing the need for manual inspection and deep system expertise. To evaluate TAAF, we introduce TraceQA-100, a benchmark of 100 questions grounded in real kernel traces. Experiments across three LLMs and multiple temporal settings show that TAAF improves answer accuracy by up to 31.2%, particularly in multi-hop and causal reasoning tasks. We further analyze where graph-grounded reasoning helps and where limitations remain, offering a foundation for next-generation trace analysis tools.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byungwoo Kang, Maceo Richards, Bernardo Sabatini</p>
<p>Abstract: Credit assignment--how changes in individual neurons and synapses affect a network's output--is central to learning in brains and machines. Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aniruddha Mahapatra, Long Mai, Cusuh Ham, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cinemagraphs, which combine static photographs with selective, looping motion, offer unique artistic appeal. Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Fatemi</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of large language models. Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiangyi Fang, Bowen Zhou, Haotian Wang, Xin Zhu, Leye Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Online 3D Bin Packing (3D-BP) with robotic arms is crucial for reducing transportation and labor costs in modern logistics. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it. Our framework employs a dynamic exploration prior that automatically balances a learned RL policy and a robust random policy based on the lookahead characteristics. Additionally, we design an auxiliary reward to penalize long-term spatial waste from individual placements. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving over 10\% gains under distributional shifts, 4\% average improvement in online deployment, and up to more than 8\% in the best case--demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Subha Ghoshal, Ali Al-Bustami</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time planning and external tools to improve reasoning. We benchmark this behavior on two real-world settings: event-centric question answering over graph-structured knowledge (Event-QA) and persuasive response generation in Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV). Using LangChain and LangGraph, we compare a one-shot baseline against a plan--execute--replan agent equipped with task-specific tools (DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-focused retrieval, and topical web search). We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates. We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency. On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\% $\rightarrow$ 67.5\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\sim$8s $\rightarrow$ $\sim$317s per example). On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\% at $\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains. However, complex multi-tool orchestration exposes failure modes where the smaller model degrades. Overall, the findings highlight the need for task-specific, cost-aware choices of both model size and agent/tooling complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Ahmed, A. Feder Cooper, Sanmi Koyejo, Percy Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Many unresolved legal questions over LLMs and copyright center on memorization: whether specific training data have been encoded in the model's weights during training, and whether those memorized data can be extracted in the model's outputs. While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%). Taken together, our work highlights that, even with model- and system-level safeguards, extraction of (in-copyright) training data remains a risk for production LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Peng, Weiyu Li, Stefan Vlaski, Qing Ling</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the development of teleconferencing and in-vehicle voice assistants, far-field multi-speaker speech recognition has become a hot research topic. Recently, a multi-channel transformer (MCT) has been proposed, which demonstrates the ability of the transformer to model far-field acoustic environments. However, MCT cannot encode high-dimensional acoustic features for each speaker from mixed input audio because of the interference between speakers. Based on these, we propose the multi-channel multi-speaker transformer (M2Former) for far-field multi-speaker ASR in this paper. Experiments on the SMS-WSJ benchmark show that the M2Former outperforms the neural beamformer, MCT, dual-path RNN with transform-average-concatenate and multi-channel deep clustering based end-to-end systems by 9.2%, 14.3%, 24.9%, and 52.2% respectively, in terms of relative word error rate reduction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems achieve impressive performance on standard benchmarks like SQuAD, but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. This project investigates the adversarial robustness of transformer models on the AddSent adversarial dataset through systematic experimentation across model scales and targeted mitigation strategies. We perform comprehensive multi-level error analysis using five complementary categorization schemes, identifying negation confusion and entity substitution as the primary failure modes. Through systematic evaluation of adversarial fine-tuning ratios, we identify 80% clean + 20% adversarial data as optimal. Data augmentation experiments reveal a capacity bottleneck in small models. Scaling from ELECTRA-small (14M parameters) to ELECTRA-base (110M parameters) eliminates the robustness-accuracy trade-off, achieving substantial improvements on both clean and adversarial data. We implement three targeted mitigation strategies, with Entity-Aware contrastive learning achieving best performance: 89.89% AddSent Exact Match (EM) and 90.73% SQuAD EM, representing 94.9% closure of the adversarial gap. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating comprehensive linguistic error analysis with Named Entity Recognition (NER)-guided contrastive learning for adversarial QA, demonstrating that targeted mitigation can achieve near-parity between clean and adversarial performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> HuiJeong Son, Hyeongu Kang, Sunho Kim, Subeen Ho, SeongKu Kang, Dongha Lee, Susik Yoon</p>
<p>Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) in dynamic data streams is emerging as a challenging task, as shifts in data distribution degrade the performance of AI-powered IR systems. To mitigate this issue, memory-based continual learning has been widely adopted for IR. However, existing methods rely on a fixed set of queries with ground-truth relevant documents, which limits generalization to unseen queries and documents, making them impractical for real-world applications. To enable more effective learning with unseen topics of a new corpus without ground-truth labels, we propose CREAM, a self-supervised framework for memory-based continual retrieval. CREAM captures the evolving semantics of streaming queries and documents into dynamically structured soft memory and leverages it to adapt to both seen and unseen topics in an unsupervised setting. We realize this through three key techniques: fine-grained similarity estimation, regularized cluster prototyping, and stratified coreset sampling. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that CREAM exhibits superior adaptability and retrieval accuracy, outperforming the strongest method in a label-free setting by 27.79\% in Success@5 and 44.5\% in Recall@10 on average, and achieving performance comparable to or even exceeding that of supervised methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqiao Xu, Mina Namazi, Sahith Reddy Jalapally, Osama Zafar, Youngjin Yoo, Erman Ayday</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning and Employment Record (LER) systems are emerging as critical infrastructure for securely compiling and sharing educational and work achievements. Existing blockchain-based platforms leverage verifiable credentials but typically lack automated skill-credential generation and the ability to incorporate unstructured evidence of learning. In this paper,a privacy-preserving, AI-enabled decentralized LER system is proposed to address these gaps. Digitally signed transcripts from educational institutions are accepted, and verifiable self-issued skill credentials are derived inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) by a natural language processing pipeline that analyzes formal records (e.g., transcripts, syllabi) and informal artifacts. All verification and job-skill matching are performed inside the enclave with selective disclosure, so raw credentials and private keys remain enclave-confined. Job matching relies solely on attested skill vectors and is invariant to non-skill resume fields, thereby reducing opportunities for screening bias.The NLP component was evaluated on sample learner data; the mapping follows the validated Syllabus-to-O*NET methodology,and a stability test across repeated runs observed <5% variance in top-ranked skills. Formal security statements and proof sketches are provided showing that derived credentials are unforgeable and that sensitive information remains confidential. The proposed system thus supports secure education and employment credentialing, robust transcript verification,and automated, privacy-preserving skill extraction within a decentralized framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Longzhen Li, Guang Li, Ren Togo, Keisuke Maeda, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that enhances patch selection in a content-adaptive manner. With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingzhe Zhang, Tong Jia, Yunpeng Zhai, Leyi Pan, Chiming Duan, Minghua He, Mengxi Jia, Ying Li</p>
<p>Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent subsystems-they are experiencing more frequent failures. Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While many traditional graph-based and deep learning approaches have been explored for this task, they often rely heavily on pre-defined schemas that struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts. Consequently, a number of LLM-based methods have recently been proposed. However, these methods still face two major limitations: shallow, symptom-centric reasoning that undermines accuracy, and a lack of cross-alert reuse that leads to redundant reasoning and high latency. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) localize the root causes of failures, drawing insights from professionals across multiple organizations. Our investigation reveals that expert root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce AMER-RCL, an agentic memory enhanced recursive reasoning framework for root cause localization in microservices. AMER-RCL employs the Recursive Reasoning RCL engine, a multi-agent framework that performs recursive reasoning on each alert to progressively refine candidate causes, while Agentic Memory incrementally accumulates and reuses reasoning from prior alerts within a time window to reduce redundant exploration and lower inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that AMER-RCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and inference efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingzhe Zhang, Tong Jia, Yunpeng Zhai, Leyi Pan, Chiming Duan, Minghua He, Pei Xiao, Ying Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Microservice systems have become the backbone of cloud-native enterprise applications due to their resource elasticity, loosely coupled architecture, and lightweight deployment. Yet, the intrinsic complexity and dynamic runtime interactions of such systems inevitably give rise to anomalies. Ensuring system reliability therefore hinges on effective root cause analysis (RCA), which entails not only localizing the source of anomalies but also characterizing the underlying failures in a timely and interpretable manner. Recent advances in intelligent RCA techniques, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated promising capabilities, as LLMs reduce reliance on handcrafted features while offering cross-platform adaptability, task generalization, and flexibility. However, existing LLM-based methods still suffer from two critical limitations: (a) limited exploration diversity, which undermines accuracy, and (b) heavy dependence on large-scale LLMs, which results in slow inference. To overcome these challenges, we propose SpecRCA, a speculative root cause analysis framework for microservices that adopts a \textit{hypothesize-then-verify} paradigm. SpecRCA first leverages a hypothesis drafting module to rapidly generate candidate root causes, and then employs a parallel root cause verifier to efficiently validate them. Preliminary experiments on the AIOps 2022 dataset demonstrate that SpecRCA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for scalable and interpretable RCA in complex microservice environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuetian Chen, Yuntao Du, Kaiyuan Zhang, Ashish Kundu, Charles Fleming, Bruno Ribeiro, Ninghui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Most membership inference attacks (MIAs) against Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on global signals, like average loss, to identify training data. This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds. Our findings reveal that aggregating localized evidence is fundamentally more effective than global averaging, exposing critical privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingming Zhang, Na Li, Zhuang Feiqing, Hongyang Zheng, Jiangbing Zhou, Wang Wuyin, Sheng-jie Sun, XiaoWei Chen, Junxiong Zhu, Lixin Zou, Chenliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyunji Nam, Sejoon Oh, Emma Kong, Yesu Feng, Moumita Bhattacharya</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated success in various applications of user recommendation and personalization across e-commerce and entertainment. On many entertainment platforms such as Netflix, users typically interact with a wide range of titles, each represented by an artwork. Since users have diverse preferences, an artwork that appeals to one type of user may not resonate with another with different preferences. Given this user heterogeneity, our work explores the novel problem of personalized artwork recommendations according to diverse user preferences. Similar to the multi-dimensional nature of users' tastes, titles contain different themes and tones that may appeal to different viewers. For example, the same title might feature both heartfelt family drama and intense action scenes. Users who prefer romantic content may like the artwork emphasizing emotional warmth between the characters, while those who prefer action thrillers may find high-intensity action scenes more intriguing. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we conduct post-training of pre-trained LLMs to make personalized artwork recommendations, selecting the most preferred visual representation of a title for each user and thereby improving user satisfaction and engagement. Our experimental results with Llama 3.1 8B models (trained on a dataset of 110K data points and evaluated on 5K held-out user-title pairs) show that the post-trained LLMs achieve 3-5\% improvements over the Netflix production model, suggesting a promising direction for granular personalized recommendations using LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhisheng Zhang, Xiang Li, Yixuan Zhou, Jing Peng, Shengbo Cai, Guoyang Zeng, Zhiyong Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) can reduce transmission overhead by performing compact compression and reconstruction, which also aim to bridge the gap between continuous and discrete signals. Existing NACs can be divided into two categories: multi-codebook and single-codebook codecs. Multi-codebook codecs face challenges such as structural complexity and difficulty in adapting to downstream tasks, while single-codebook codecs, though structurally simpler, suffer from low-fidelity, ineffective modeling of unified audio, and an inability to support modeling of high-frequency audio. We propose the UniSRCodec, a single-codebook codec capable of supporting high sampling rate, low-bandwidth, high fidelity, and unified. We analyze the inefficiency of waveform-based compression and introduce the time and frequency compression method using the Mel-spectrogram, and cooperate with a Vocoder to recover the phase information of the original audio. Moreover, we propose a sub-band reconstruction technique to achieve high-quality compression across both low and high frequency bands. Subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that UniSRCodec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among cross-domain single-codebook codecs with only a token rate of 40, and its reconstruction quality is comparable to that of certain multi-codebook methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyu Dong, Zhengmao He, Yang Li, Zhibin Li, Xinyu Yi, Zhe Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-like dexterous hands with multiple fingers offer human-level manipulation capabilities, but training control policies that can directly deploy on real hardware remains difficult due to contact-rich physics and imperfect actuation. We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of controllable grasping on a multi-finger dexterous hand trained entirely in simulation and transferred zero-shot on real hardware.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present MiMo-V2-Flash, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 309B total parameters and 15B active parameters, designed for fast, strong reasoning and agentic capabilities. MiMo-V2-Flash adopts a hybrid attention architecture that interleaves Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with global attention, with a 128-token sliding window under a 5:1 hybrid ratio. The model is pre-trained on 27 trillion tokens with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), employing a native 32k context length and subsequently extended to 256k. To efficiently scale post-training compute, MiMo-V2-Flash introduces a novel Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) paradigm. In this framework, domain-specialized teachers (e.g., trained via large-scale reinforcement learning) provide dense and token-level reward, enabling the student model to perfectly master teacher expertise. MiMo-V2-Flash rivals top-tier open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3.2 and Kimi-K2, despite using only 1/2 and 1/3 of their total parameters, respectively. During inference, by repurposing MTP as a draft model for speculative decoding, MiMo-V2-Flash achieves up to 3.6 acceptance length and 2.6x decoding speedup with three MTP layers. We open-source both the model weights and the three-layer MTP weights to foster open research and community collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuteng Liu, Duanni Meng, Maoxun Yuan, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small target size, and complex cluttered backgrounds. Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Long-horizon conversational agents have to manage ever-growing interaction histories that quickly exceed the finite context windows of large language models (LLMs). Existing memory frameworks provide limited support for temporally structured information across hierarchical levels, often leading to fragmented memories and unstable long-horizon personalization. We present TiMem, a temporal--hierarchical memory framework that organizes conversations through a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT), enabling systematic memory consolidation from raw conversational observations to progressively abstracted persona representations. TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo. Manifold analysis indicates clear persona separation on LoCoMo and reduced dispersion on LongMemEval-S. Overall, TiMem treats temporal continuity as a first-class organizing principle for long-horizon memory in conversational agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Chen, Xing Wu, Junlong Jia, Chaochen Gao, Qi Fu, Debing Zhang, Songlin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of context length in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks. Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the "thinking" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off. In summary, LongBench Pro provides a robust testbed for advancing long-context understanding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tracking objects that move within dynamic environments is a core challenge in robotics. Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOST-3DSG in dynamic object tracking.

<p>Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.</p>

In this paper, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Learning-to-Match (RAL2M), a novel framework that eliminates generation hallucination by repositioning LLMs as query-response matching judges within a retrieval-based system, providing a robust alternative to purely generative approaches. To further mitigate judgment hallucination, we propose a query-adaptive latent ensemble strategy that explicitly models heterogeneous model competence and interdependencies among LLMs, deriving a calibrated consensus decision. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively leverages the "wisdom of the crowd" and significantly outperforms strong baselines. Finally, we discuss best practices and promising directions for further exploiting latent representations in future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aihua Zheng, Ya Gao, Shihao Li, Chenglong Li, Jin Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to leverage complementary information from RGB, Near Infrared (NIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR) modalities to retrieve the same vehicle. The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> I\~naki Erregue, Kamal Nasrollahi, Sergio Escalera</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools are among the most widely used techniques in defensive cybersecurity, employed by commercial and non-commercial organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities in software. Despite their great utility, they generate numerous false positives, requiring costly manual filtering (aka triage). While LLM-powered agents show promise for automating cybersecurity tasks, existing benchmarks fail to emulate real-world SAST finding distributions. We introduce SastBench, a benchmark for evaluating SAST triage agents that combines real CVEs as true positives with filtered SAST tool findings as approximate false positives. SastBench features an agent-agnostic design. We evaluate different agents on the benchmark and present a comparative analysis of their performance, provide a detailed analysis of the dataset, and discuss the implications for future development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhuan You, Lai Wei, Xihong Wu, Tianshu Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing large audio-language models perceive the world as "mono" -- a single stream of audio that ignores the critical spatial dimension ("where") required for universal acoustic scene analysis. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a hierarchical framework for Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA). Guided by this framework, we introduce a system that enables models like Qwen2-Audio to understand and reason about the complex acoustic world. Our framework achieves this through three core contributions: First, we build a large-scale, synthesized binaural audio dataset to provide the rich spatial cues. Second, we design a hybrid feature projector, which leverages parallel semantic and spatial encoders to extract decoupled representations. These distinct streams are integrated via a dense fusion mechanism, ensuring the model receives a holistic view of the acoustic scene. Finally, we employ a progressive training curriculum, advancing from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to explicitly evolve the model's capabilities towards reasoning. On our comprehensive benchmark, the model demonstrates comparatively strong capability for spatial understanding. By enabling this spatial perception, our work provides a clear pathway for leveraging the powerful reasoning abilities of large models towards holistic acoustic scene analysis, advancing from "mono" semantic recognition to spatial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yishu Lei, Shuwei He, Jing Hu, Dan Zhang, Xianlong Luo, Danxiang Zhu, Shikun Feng, Rui Liu, Jingzhou He, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Extending the input modality of Large Language Models~(LLMs) to the audio domain is essential for achieving comprehensive multimodal perception. However, it is well-known that acoustic information is intrinsically \textit{heterogeneous}, entangling attributes such as speech, music, and environmental context. Existing research is limited to a dense, parameter-shared adapter to model these diverse patterns, which induces \textit{gradient conflict} during optimization, as parameter updates required for distinct attributes contradict each other. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textit{\textbf{MoE-Adapter}}, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture designed to decouple acoustic information. Specifically, it employs a dynamic gating mechanism that routes audio tokens to specialized experts capturing complementary feature subspaces while retaining shared experts for global context, thereby mitigating gradient conflicts and enabling fine-grained feature learning. Comprehensive experiments show that the MoE-Adapter achieves superior performance on both audio semantic and paralinguistic tasks, consistently outperforming dense linear baselines with comparable computational costs. Furthermore, we will release the related code and models to facilitate future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathana\"el Carraz Rakotonirina, Ren Pang, Neha Anna John, Michael Bohlke-Schneider, Momchil Hardalov</p>
<p>Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved substantially through increased test-time computation, typically in the form of intermediate tokens known as chain-of-thought (CoT). However, CoT often becomes unnecessarily long, increasing computation cost without actual accuracy gains or sometimes even degrading performance, a phenomenon known as ``overthinking''. We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy--response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\% for 8B models and 40\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\text{AUC}_{\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruikang Zhang, Shuo Wang, Qi Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has enabled the identification and intervention of internal features in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuankun Xie, Xiaoxuan Guo, Jiayi Zhou, Tao Wang, Jian Liu, Ruibo Fu, Xiaopeng Wang, Haonan Cheng, Long Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in audio large language models (ALLMs) have made high-quality synthetic audio widely accessible, increasing the risk of malicious audio deepfakes across speech, environmental sounds, singing voice, and music. Real-world audio deepfake detection (ADD) therefore requires all-type detectors that generalize across heterogeneous audio and provide interpretable decisions. Given the strong multi-task generalization ability of ALLMs, we first investigate their performance on all-type ADD under both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, SFT using only binary real/fake labels tends to reduce the model to a black-box classifier, sacrificing interpretability. Meanwhile, vanilla RFT under sparse supervision is prone to reward hacking and can produce hallucinated, ungrounded rationales. To address this, we propose an automatic annotation and polishing pipeline that constructs Frequency-Time structured chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, producing ~340K cold-start demonstrations. Building on CoT data, we propose Frequency Time-Group Relative Policy Optimization (FT-GRPO), a two-stage training paradigm that cold-starts ALLMs with SFT and then applies GRPO under rule-based frequency-time constraints. Experiments demonstrate that FT-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on all-type ADD while producing interpretable, FT-grounded rationales. The data and code are available online.</p>

To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we present ULS+, an enhanced version of the Universal Lesion Segmentation (ULS) model. The original ULS model segments lesions across the whole body in CT scans given volumes of interest (VOIs) centered around a click-point. Since its release, several new public datasets have become available that can further improve model performance. ULS+ incorporates these additional datasets and uses smaller input image sizes, resulting in higher accuracy and faster inference.
  We compared ULS and ULS+ using the Dice score and robustness to click-point location on the ULS23 Challenge test data and a subset of the Longitudinal-CT dataset. In all comparisons, ULS+ significantly outperformed ULS. Additionally, ULS+ ranks first on the ULS23 Challenge test-phase leaderboard. By maintaining a cycle of data-driven updates and clinical validation, ULS+ establishes a foundation for robust and clinically relevant lesion segmentation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengcheng Feng, Haojie Yin, Yucheng Jin, Kaizhu Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\mathbf{12.1\%}$ across different MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-based robotic policies often struggle with even minor viewpoint changes, underscoring the need for view-invariant visual representations. This challenge becomes more pronounced in real-world settings, where viewpoint variability is unavoidable and can significantly disrupt policy performance. Existing methods typically learn invariance from multi-view observations at the scene level, but such approaches rely on visual appearance and fail to incorporate the physical dynamics essential for robust generalization. We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences. Experiments in both simulation and the real world show that VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks, establishing VILA as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite extensive safety alignment, Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail against jailbreak attacks. While machine unlearning has emerged as a promising defense by erasing specific harmful parameters, current methods remain vulnerable to diverse jailbreaks. We first conduct an empirical study and discover that this failure mechanism is caused by jailbreaks primarily activating non-erased parameters in the intermediate layers. Further, by probing the underlying mechanism through which these circumvented parameters reassemble into the prohibited output, we verify the persistent existence of dynamic $\textbf{jailbreak paths}$ and show that the inability to rectify them constitutes the fundamental gap in existing unlearning defenses. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{J}$ailbreak $\textbf{P}$ath $\textbf{U}$nlearning (JPU), which is the first to rectify dynamic jailbreak paths towards safety anchors by dynamically mining on-policy adversarial samples to expose vulnerabilities and identify jailbreak paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JPU significantly enhances jailbreak resistance against dynamic attacks while preserving the model's utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junli Liang, Pengfei Zhou, Wangqiu Zhou, Wenjie Qing, Qi Zhao, Ziwen Wang, Qi Song, Xiangyang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively supports single-hop question answering with large language models but faces significant limitations in multi-hop question answering tasks, which require combining evidence from multiple documents. Existing chunk-based retrieval often provides irrelevant and logically incoherent context, leading to incomplete evidence chains and incorrect reasoning during answer generation. To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges. During online retrieval, SentGraph performs graph-guided evidence selection and path expansion to retrieve fine-grained sentence-level evidence. Extensive experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SentGraph, validating the importance of explicitly modeling sentence-level logical dependencies for multi-hop reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ana\"is Berkes, Vincent Taboga, Donna Vakalis, David Rolnick, Yoshua Bengio</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) promises fast adaptation to unseen environments without parameter updates, but current methods either cannot improve beyond the training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.</p>

<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical text understanding, they struggle with longitudinal prediction tasks such as dementia prognosis, which require reasoning over complex, non-monotonic symptom trajectories across multiple visits. Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets. Notably, on the ADNI benchmark, our 7B model rivals GPT-4o, effectively capturing fluctuating cognitive trajectories. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dementiar1-CDB5</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vidhi Rathore</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, yet standard approaches often treat data as static points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying generative structure. We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.</p>

However, their validation remains challenging because each task induces its own operational context and correctness specification, exceeding the assumptions of traditional validation methods. We propose a two-layer validation framework that combines abstract reasoning with concrete system falsification. At the abstract layer, situation calculus models the world and derives weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing to systematically generate diverse, semantically valid world-task configurations with controllable coverage strength. At the concrete layer, these configurations are instantiated for simulation-based falsification with STL monitoring. Experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks show that our framework effectively uncovers failure cases in the NVIDIA GR00T controller, demonstrating its promise for validating general-purpose robot autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arup Kumar Sahoo, Itzik Klein</p>
<p>Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy is the ability to sustain accurate navigation in the absence of external data, such as GNSS signals or visual information. In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities across a wide range of complex tasks and are increasingly deployed at scale, placing significant demands on inference efficiency. Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zhang, Yanwei Wang, Fang Li, Hongjun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.</p>

First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Janvijay Singh, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models solve complex tasks by generating long reasoning chains, achieving higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational cost and reduced ability to isolate functionally relevant reasoning. Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joseph Kampeas, Emir Haleva</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.
  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Huang, Antoni B. Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency and faithfulness. Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $\pi$-Soft-NC and $\pi$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models. Experiment results show that Grad-ELLM consistently achieves superior faithfulness than other attribution methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenchen Lin, Sanbao Su, Rachel Luo, Yuxiao Chen, Yan Wang, Marco Pavone, Fei Miao</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humor preferences vary widely across individuals and cultures, complicating the evaluation of humor using large language models (LLMs). In this study, we model heterogeneity in humor preferences in Oogiri, a Japanese creative response game, by clustering users with voting logs and estimating cluster-specific weights over interpretable preference factors using Bradley-Terry-Luce models. We elicit preference judgments from LLMs by prompting them to select the funnier response and found that user clusters exhibit distinct preference patterns and that the LLM results can resemble those of particular clusters. Finally, we demonstrate that, by persona prompting, LLM preferences can be directed toward a specific cluster. The scripts for data collection and analysis will be released to support reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lalit Pandey, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>
<p>Abstract: Do transformers learn like brains? A key challenge in addressing this question is that transformers and brains are trained on fundamentally different data. Brains are initially "trained" on prenatal sensory experiences (e.g., retinal waves), whereas transformers are typically trained on large datasets that are not biologically plausible. We reasoned that if transformers learn like brains, then they should develop the same structure as newborn brains when exposed to the same prenatal data. To test this prediction, we simulated prenatal visual input using a retinal wave generator. Then, using self-supervised temporal learning, we trained transformers to adapt to those retinal waves. During training, the transformers spontaneously developed the same structure as newborn visual systems: (1) early layers became sensitive to edges, (2) later layers became sensitive to shapes, and (3) the models developed larger receptive fields across layers. The organization of newborn visual systems emerges spontaneously when transformers adapt to a prenatal visual world. This developmental convergence suggests that brains and transformers learn in common ways and follow the same general fitting principles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peiran Li, Jan Fillies, Adrian Paschke</p>
<p>Abstract: Augmenting toxic language data in a controllable and class-specific manner is crucial for improving robustness in toxicity classification, yet remains challenging due to limited supervision and distributional skew. We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.</p>

The plant disease dataset contains grape leaf diseases total of 9,032 images of four classes, among them three classes are leaf diseases, and the other one is healthy leaves. After rigorous pre-processing dataset was split (70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing), and two pre-trained models were deployed: InceptionV3 and Xception. Xception shows a promising result of 96.23% accuracy, which is remarkable than InceptionV3. Adversarial Training is used for robustness, along with more transparency. Grad-CAM is integrated to confirm the leaf disease.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sashuai Zhou, Qiang Zhou, Jijin Hu, Hanqing Yang, Yue Cao, Junpeng Ma, Yinchao Ma, Jun Song, Tiezheng Ge, Cheng Yu, Bo Zheng, Zhou Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.</p>

<p>Abstract: Language plays a critical role in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet the linguistic characteristics of the datasets used to train and evaluate these systems remain poorly documented. In this work, we present a systematic dataset audit of several widely used VLA corpora, aiming to characterize what kinds of instructions these datasets actually contain and how much linguistic variety they provide. We quantify instruction language along complementary dimensions-including lexical variety, duplication and overlap, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Our analysis shows that many datasets rely on highly repetitive, template-like commands with limited structural variation, yielding a narrow distribution of instruction forms. We position these findings as descriptive documentation of the language signal available in current VLA training and evaluation data, intended to support more detailed dataset reporting, more principled dataset selection, and targeted curation or augmentation strategies that broaden language coverage.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on highly professional and structured examinations remains a significant challenge. The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks. Our dataset and codes are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sofie Goethals, Foster Provost, Jo\~ao Sedoc</p>
<p>Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Time series augmentation is critical for training robust deep learning models, particularly in domains where labelled data is scarce and expensive to obtain. However, existing augmentation libraries for time series, mainly written in Python, suffer from performance bottlenecks, where running time grows exponentially as dataset sizes increase -- an aspect limiting their applicability in large-scale, production-grade systems. We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\% less peak memory usage.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are recognized as a transformative breakthrough that has started to reshape the future of artificial intelligence (AI) across both academia and industry. The integration of FMs into wireless networks is expected to enable the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of handling diverse network management requests and highly complex wireless-related tasks involving multi-modal data. Inspired by these ideas, this work discusses the utilization of FMs, especially multi-modal FMs in wireless networks. We focus on two important types of tasks in wireless network management: prediction tasks and control tasks. In particular, we first discuss FMs-enabled multi-modal contextual information understanding in wireless networks. Then, we explain how FMs can be applied to prediction and control tasks, respectively. Following this, we introduce the development of wireless-specific FMs from two perspectives: available datasets for development and the methodologies used. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the challenges and future directions for FM-enhanced wireless networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

<p>Abstract: While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for general natural language tasks with in-context examples. However, due to the bidirectional attention mechanism, DLMs incur substantial computational cost as context length increases. This work addresses this issue with a key discovery: unlike the sequential generation in autoregressive language models (ARLMs), the diffusion generation paradigm in DLMs allows \textit{efficient dynamic adjustment of the context} during generation. Building on this insight, we propose \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{I}n-Context \textbf{P}lanner (DIP), a context-optimization method that dynamically selects and inserts in-context examples during generation, rather than providing all examples in the prompt upfront. Results show DIP maintains generation quality while achieving up to 12.9$\times$ inference speedup over standard inference and 1.17$\times$ over KV cache-enhanced inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Expressive querying of machine learning models - viewed as a form of intentional data - enables their verification and interpretation using declarative languages, thereby making learned representations of data more accessible. Motivated by the querying of feedforward neural networks, we investigate logics for weighted structures. In the absence of a bound on neural network depth, such logics must incorporate recursion; thereto we revisit the functional fixpoint mechanism proposed by Gr\"adel and Gurevich. We adopt it in a Datalog-like syntax; we extend normal forms for fixpoint logics to weighted structures; and show an equivalent "loose" fixpoint mechanism that allows values of inductively defined weight functions to be overwritten. We propose a "scalar" restriction of functional fixpoint logic, of polynomial-time data complexity, and show it can express all PTIME model-agnostic queries over reduced networks with polynomially bounded weights. In contrast, we show that very simple model-agnostic queries are already NP-complete. Finally, we consider transformations of weighted structures by iterated transductions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating machine learning (ML) model bias is key to building trustworthy and robust ML systems. Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yile Liu, Yixian Liu, Zongwei Li, Yufei Huang, Xinhua Feng, Zhichao Hu, Jinglu Hu, Jianfeng Yan, Fengzong Lian, Yuhong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing , complex general-purpose reasoning requiring multi-step logic, planning, and verification remains a critical bottleneck. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production. The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima.</p>

<p>Abstract: In enterprise search, building high-quality datasets at scale remains a central challenge due to the difficulty of acquiring labeled data. To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient approach to fine-tune small language models (SLMs) for accurate relevance labeling, enabling high-throughput, domain-specific labeling comparable or even better in quality to that of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). To overcome the lack of high-quality and accessible datasets in the enterprise domain, our method leverages on synthetic data generation. Specifically, we employ an LLM to synthesize realistic enterprise queries from a seed document, apply BM25 to retrieve hard negatives, and use a teacher LLM to assign relevance scores. The resulting dataset is then distilled into an SLM, producing a compact relevance labeler. We evaluate our approach on a high-quality benchmark consisting of 923 enterprise query-document pairs annotated by trained human annotators, and show that the distilled SLM achieves agreement with human judgments on par with or better than the teacher LLM. Furthermore, our fine-tuned labeler substantially improves throughput, achieving 17 times increase while also being 19 times more cost-effective. This approach enables scalable and cost-effective relevance labeling for enterprise-scale retrieval applications, supporting rapid offline evaluation and iteration in real-world settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jacob Erickson</p>
<p>Abstract: As conversational AI systems become increasingly integrated into everyday life, they raise pressing concerns about user autonomy, trust, and the commercial interests that influence their behavior. To address these concerns, this paper develops the Fake Friend Dilemma (FFD), a sociotechnical condition in which users place trust in AI agents that appear supportive while pursuing goals that are misaligned with the user's own. The FFD provides a critical framework for examining how anthropomorphic AI systems facilitate subtle forms of manipulation and exploitation. Drawing on literature in trust, AI alignment, and surveillance capitalism, we construct a typology of harms, including covert advertising, political propaganda, behavioral nudging, and surveillance. We then assess possible mitigation strategies, including both structural and technical interventions. By focusing on trust as a vector of asymmetrical power, the FFD offers a lens for understanding how AI systems may undermine user autonomy while maintaining the appearance of helpfulness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruixing Zhang, Zihan Liu, Leilei Sun, Tongyu Zhu, Weifeng Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Geo-localization aims to infer the geographic origin of a given signal. In computer vision, geo-localization has served as a demanding benchmark for compositional reasoning and is relevant to public safety. In contrast, progress on audio geo-localization has been constrained by the lack of high-quality audio-location pairs. To address this gap, we introduce AGL1K, the first audio geo-localization benchmark for audio language models (ALMs), spanning 72 countries and territories. To extract reliably localizable samples from a crowd-sourced platform, we propose the Audio Localizability metric that quantifies the informativeness of each recording, yielding 1,444 curated audio clips. Evaluations on 16 ALMs show that ALMs have emerged with audio geo-localization capability. We find that closed-source models substantially outperform open-source models, and that linguistic clues often dominate as a scaffold for prediction. We further analyze ALMs' reasoning traces, regional bias, error causes, and the interpretability of the localizability metric. Overall, AGL1K establishes a benchmark for audio geo-localization and may advance ALMs with better geospatial reasoning capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Background: Reporting and Data Systems (RADS) standardize radiology risk communication but automated RADS assignment from narrative reports is challenging because of guideline complexity, output-format constraints, and limited benchmarking across RADS frameworks and model sizes. Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal model development have ignited a paradigm shift in the realm of text-to-image generation. Among these advancements, CLIP stands out as a remarkable achievement which is a sophisticated autoencoder adept at encoding both textual and visual information within a unified latent space. This paper delves into a comparative analysis between CLIP and its recent counterpart, CLOOB. To unravel the intricate distinctions within the embedding spaces crafted by these models, we employ topological data analysis. Our approach encompasses a comprehensive examination of the modality gap drivers, the clustering structures existing across both high and low dimensions, and the pivotal role that dimension collapse plays in shaping their respective embedding spaces. Empirical experiments substantiate the implications of our analyses on downstream performance across various contextual scenarios. Through this investigation, we aim to shed light on the nuanced intricacies that underlie the comparative efficacy of CLIP and CLOOB, offering insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses, and providing a foundation for further refinement and advancement in multimodal model research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ting Yu Tsai, Liangqiao Gui, Yineng Chen, Li Lin, Shu Hu, Connie W. Tsao, Xin Li, Shao Lin, Ming-Ching Chang, Hongtu Zhu, Xin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved significant success in segmenting cardiovascular structures, but there is a growing need to improve their generalization and robustness. Current methods often face challenges such as overfitting and limited accuracy, largely due to their reliance on large annotated datasets and limited optimization techniques. This paper introduces the UU-Mamba model, an extension of the U-Mamba architecture, designed to address these challenges in both cardiac and vascular segmentation. By incorporating Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), the model enhances generalization by seeking flatter minima in the loss landscape. Additionally, we propose an uncertainty-aware loss function that integrates region-based, distribution-based, and pixel-based components, improving segmentation accuracy by capturing both local and global features. We expand our evaluations on the ImageCAS (coronary artery) and Aorta (aortic branches and zones) datasets, which present more complex segmentation challenges than the ACDC dataset (left and right ventricles) used in prior work, showcasing the model's adaptability and resilience. Our results confirm UU-Mamba's superior performance compared to leading models such as TransUNet, Swin-Unet, nnUNet, and nnFormer. We also provide a more in-depth assessment of the model's robustness and segmentation accuracy through extensive experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leyao Wang, Yu Wang, Bo Ni, Yuying Zhao, Hanyu Wang, Yao Ma, Tyler Derr</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world graph data often follows long-tailed distributions, making it difficult for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize well across both head and tail classes. Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Tuisov, Yonatan Vernik, Alexander Shleyfman</p>
<p>Abstract: Heuristics are a central component of deterministic planning, particularly in domain-independent settings where general applicability is prioritized over task-specific tuning. This work revisits that paradigm in light of recent advances in large language models (LLMs), which enable the automatic synthesis of heuristics directly from problem definitions -- bypassing the need for handcrafted domain knowledge. We present a method that employs LLMs to generate problem-specific heuristic functions from planning tasks specified through successor generators, goal tests, and initial states written in a general-purpose programming language. These heuristics are compiled and integrated into standard heuristic search algorithms, such as greedy best-first search. Our approach achieves competitive, and in many cases state-of-the-art, performance across a broad range of established planning benchmarks. Moreover, it enables the solution of problems that are difficult to express in traditional formalisms, including those with complex numeric constraints or custom transition dynamics. We provide an extensive empirical evaluation that characterizes the strengths and limitations of the approach across diverse planning settings, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongmin Yoo, Qiongkai Xu, Longbing Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: Patent similarity evaluation plays a critical role in intellectual property analysis. However, existing methods often overlook the intricate structure of patent documents, which integrate technical specifications, legal boundaries, and application contexts. We introduce PatentMind, a novel framework for patent similarity assessment based on a Multi-Aspect Reasoning Graph (MARG). PatentMind decomposes patents into their three dimensions of technical features, application domains, and claim scopes, then dimension-specific similarity scores are calculated over the MARG. These scores are dynamically weighted through a context-aware reasoning process, which integrates contextual signals to emulate expert-level judgment. To support evaluation, we construct a human-annotated benchmark PatentSimBench, comprising 500 patent pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the PatentMind-generated scores show a strong correlation ($r=0.938$) with expert annotations, significantly outperforming embedding-based models, patent-specific models, and advanced prompt engineering methods. Beyond computational linguistics, our framework provides a structured and semantically grounded foundation for real-world decision-making, particularly for tasks such as infringement risk assessment, underscoring its broader impact on both patent analytics and evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjia Zhang, Junjie Wu, Jiawei Chen, Changwang Zhang, Zhe Li, Xingyu Lou, Wangchunshu Zhou, Sheng Zhou, Can Wang, Jun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human cognition operates through two complementary modes: fast intuitive thinking and slow deliberate thinking. Vanilla large language models (LLMs) predominantly follow the fast-thinking paradigm, producing immediate responses; while recent large reasoning models (LRMs) adopt slow-thinking strategies, generating detailed reasoning chains before arriving at answers. While LRMs often achieve higher accuracy, this comes at the cost of substantially increased token usage. To address this efficiency-accuracy trade-off, we propose OThink-R1, a hybrid reasoning framework that integrates both modes within a single LRM and enables automatic mode switching based on problem characteristics. We first identify three major patterns of essential and redundant reasoning trajectories in LRMs, which guide the design of an auxiliary LLM-based judge that adaptively determines when slow thinking is necessary. Leveraging the judge's decisions, we construct a hybrid fine-tuning dataset by pruning redundant reasoning to produce fast-thinking samples and retaining complete reasoning for slow-thinking samples. This dataset is then used to fine-tune LRMs, equipping them with inherent autonomous mode-selection capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical and question-answering benchmarks show that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning token usage significantly while maintaining competitive accuracy.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lukas Helff, Ahmad Omar, Felix Friedrich, Antonia W\"ust, Hikaru Shindo, Rupert Mitchell, Tim Woydt, Patrick Schramowski, Wolfgang Stammer, Kristian Kersting</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengtao Jian, Kai Yang, Tianhao Gao, Wuguang Ni, Keying Yang, Bowen Xiao, Jiajun Liu, Ye Ouyang</p>
<p>Abstract: Direct Preference Learning has emerged as a dominant offline paradigm for preference optimization. Most of these methods are based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model for pairwise preference ranking, which directly aligns language model with human preference. Prior work has observed a counter-intuitive phenomenon termed likelihood displacement, where the absolute probability of preferred responses decreases simultaneously during training. We demonstrate that such displacement can lead to a more devastating failure mode, which we defined as \textit{Catastrophic Preference Shift}, where the lost preference probability mass inadvertently shifts toward out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. Such a failure mode is a key limitation shared across BT-style direct preference learning methods, due to the fundamental conflict between the unconstrained discriminative alignment and generative foundational capabilities, ultimately leading to severe performance degradation (e.g., SimPO suffers a significant drop in reasoning accuracy from 73.5\% to 37.5\%). We analyze existing BT-style methods from the probability evolution perspective and theoretically prove that these methods exhibit over-reliance on model initialization and can lead to preference shift. To resolve these counter-intuitive behaviors, we propose a theoretically grounded Stable Preference Optimization (SPO) framework that constrains preference learning within a safe alignment region. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SPO effectively stabilizes and enhances the performance of existing BT-style preference learning methods. SPO provides new insights into the design of preference learning objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong autonomy, but their stochastic behavior introduces unpredictable safety risks. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, are reactive, intervening only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has occurred, lacking foresight for long-horizon dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we present a proactive runtime enforcement framework for LLM agents. The framework abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it predicts the probability of leading to undesired behaviors and intervenes before violations occur when the estimated risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. Designed to provide PAC-correctness guarantee, the framework achieves statistically reliable enforcement of agent safety. We evaluate the framework across two safety-critical domains: autonomous vehicles and embodied agents. It proactively enforces safety and maintains high task performance, outperforming existing methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning traces that compromise both computational efficiency and interpretability. Unlike prior efforts that rely on global length-based rewards, we propose a semantic-aware decomposition of redundancy into two distinct forms: internal redundancy (informational stagnation within the reasoning process) and external redundancy (superfluous continuation after the final answer). We introduce a dual-penalty reinforcement learning framework that surgically targets these inefficiencies: a sliding-window semantic analysis is employed to penalize low-gain steps within the reasoning trajectory, while a normalized metric suppresses the post-answer tail. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly compresses Chain-of-Thought traces with minimal accuracy degradation, while maintaining strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Crucially, we reveal an asymmetry in redundancy: external redundancy can be safely eliminated without performance loss, whereas internal redundancy removal requires a calibrated trade-off to maintain reasoning fidelity. Our framework enables fine-grained, implicit control over reasoning length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable LRMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across several environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaizhen Tan, Yufan Wu, Yuxuan Liu, Haoran Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable, human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction, color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions: tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.</p>

<p>Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.</p>

However, existing approaches remain constrained by their derivative nature, relying on real-world records, which pose privacy risks and distribution biases. Furthermore, current patient agents face the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma, struggling to maintain clinical consistency during dynamic inquiries. To address these challenges, we introduce Patient-Zero, a novel framework for ab initio patient simulation that requires no real medical records. Our Medically-Aligned Hierarchical Synthesis framework generates comprehensive and diverse patient records from abstract clinical guidelines via stratified attribute permutation. To support rigorous clinical interaction, we design a Dual-Track Cognitive Memory System to enable agents dynamically update memory while preserving logical consistency and persona adherence. Extensive evaluations show that Patient-Zero establishes a new state-of-the-art in both data quality and interaction fidelity. In human expert evaluations, senior licensed physicians judge our synthetic data to be statistically indistinguishable from real human-authored data and higher in clinical quality. Furthermore, downstream medical reasoning model trained on our synthetic dataset shows substantial performance gains (MedQA +24.0%; MMLU +14.5%), demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Shee, Anthony M. Smaldone, Anton Morgunov, Gregory W. Kyro, Victor S. Batista</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of deconstructing a target molecule into simpler precursors, is crucial for computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP). Widely adopted tree-search methods often suffer from exponential computational complexity. In this work, we introduce FragmentRetro, a novel retrosynthetic method that leverages fragmentation algorithms, specifically BRICS and r-BRICS, combined with stock-aware exploration and pattern fingerprint screening to achieve quadratic complexity. FragmentRetro recursively combines molecular fragments and verifies their presence in a building block set, providing sets of fragment combinations as retrosynthetic solutions. We present the first formal computational analysis of retrosynthetic methods, showing that tree search exhibits exponential complexity $O(b^h)$, DirectMultiStep scales as $O(h^6)$, and FragmentRetro achieves $O(h^2)$, where $h$ represents the number of heavy atoms in the target molecule and $b$ is the branching factor for tree search. Evaluations on PaRoutes, USPTO-190, and natural products demonstrate that FragmentRetro achieves high solved rates with competitive runtime, including cases where tree search fails. The method benefits from fingerprint screening, which significantly reduces substructure matching complexity. While FragmentRetro focuses on efficiently identifying fragment-based solutions rather than full reaction pathways, its computational advantages and ability to generate strategic starting candidates establish it as a powerful foundational component for scalable and automated synthesis planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sha Li, Stefano Petrangeli, Yu Shen, Xiang Chen, Naren Ramakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions for complex tasks, their ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships remains limited. Such capabilities are crucial for content-aware graphic layout design, where the goal is to arrange heterogeneous elements onto a canvas so that final design remains visually balanced and structurally feasible. This problem requires precise coordination of placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within a constrained visual space. To address this limitation, we introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM-based agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities for layout design. LaySPA employs hybrid reward signals that jointly capture geometric constraints, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to navigate the canvas, model inter-element relationships, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through group-relative policy optimization, the agent generates content-aware layouts that reflect salient regions, respect spatial constraints, and produces an interpretable reasoning trace explaining placement decisions and a structured layout specification. Experimental results show that LaySPA substantially improves the generation of structurally valid and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized layout models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yara Mohajerani</p>
<p>Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines geospatial agent-based modelling with asset-level damage functions, featuring an illustrative three-sector economy (commodity, manufacturing, retail) with adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, comparing four scenarios: baseline and hazard conditions with and without evolutionary learning. Our results show that increasingly frequent and intense acute hazards lower firm production levels, liquidity, and capital, while increasing the prices of goods and unemployment. The framework reveals systemic risks where even agents not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions. Importantly, evolutionary adaptation enables firms to maintain higher production, capital, liquidity, wages and employment levels while keeping prices lower compared to non-learning counterparts. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking, Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC) Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA) completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience. Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks, achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of each component to the framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Liu, Xiaopeng Wu, Jingquan Peng, Kehan Chen, Chuan Yu, Lizhong Ding, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a dominant paradigm for training autonomous agents, yet these agents often exhibit poor generalization, failing to adapt to scenarios not seen during training. In this work, we identify a fundamental cause of this brittleness, a phenomenon which we term "gradient coupling." We hypothesize that in complex agentic tasks, the high similarity between distinct states leads to destructive interference between gradients. Specifically, a gradient update that reinforces an optimal action in one state can inadvertently increase the likelihood of a suboptimal action in a similar, yet different, state. To solve this, we propose a novel objective where the actor is trained to simultaneously function as a classifier that separates good and bad actions. This auxiliary pressure compels the model to learn disentangled embeddings for positive and negative actions, which mitigates negative gradient interference and improve the generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter Pak, Achuth Chandrasekhar, Amir Barati Farimani</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy selection and evaluation remains a complex challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol (MCP) to perform actions such as thermophysical property diagram calculations and lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system can effectively reason through complex user prompts and provide analysis on the lack of fusion process window of common alloys such as SS316L and IN718 along with proposed composition variants of known alloys. These agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical environments. This work aims to showcase the benefits of adopting a LLM enabled multi-agent system to automate and accelerate the task of evaluating proposed additive manufacturing alloys, both novel and known.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayank Ravishankara, Varindra V. Persad Maharaj</p>
<p>Abstract: This survey paper chronicles the evolution of evaluation in multimodal artificial intelligence (AI), framing it as a progression of increasingly sophisticated "cognitive examinations." We argue that the field is undergoing a paradigm shift, moving from simple recognition tasks that test "what" a model sees, to complex reasoning benchmarks that probe "why" and "how" it understands. This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks, where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey from the foundational "knowledge tests" of the ImageNet era to the "applied logic and comprehension" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey the current frontier of "expert-level integration" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench, SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself. Finally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative, and social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating truly intelligent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeong Kyu Choi, Xiaojin Zhu, Sharon Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions. Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First, we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias and improving trustworthiness. Third, we define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled bias metric that measures an agent's tendency to follow its peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple models and benchmarks confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather than identity. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii) visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Huang, Peining Li, Meiyu Liang, Xu Hou, Junping Du, Yingxia Shao, Guanhua Ye, Wu Liu, Kangkang Lu, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Yu, Jiayi Zhang, Huixue Su, Yufan Zhao, Yifan Wu, Mingyi Deng, Jinyu Xiang, Yizhang Lin, Lingxiao Tang, Yuyu Luo, Bang Liu, Chenglin Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunghyun Wee, Suyoung Kim, Hyeonjin Kim, Kyomin Hwang, Nojun Kwak</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety and efficiency are paramount yet often conflicting requirements for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is applied afterward to ensure efficiency. Here we identify a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization (AAQ), a novel approach that integrates an Alignment-Preserving Contrastive (APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Our method explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. AAQ achieves robust safety alignment without specialized safety-focused datasets, using only standard calibration data. We show that AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy. Anonymized code is available in the supplementary material.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enoch Hyunwook Kang, Hema Yoganarasimhan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled self-improving AI systems that iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine their outcomes. Recent studies show that prompt-optimization-based self-improvement can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuning of LLMs, but performance is typically measured by generation efficiency. However, in many applications, the constraint is evaluation efficiency: obtaining reliable feedback is far more costly than generating candidates. To optimize for evaluation efficiency, we extend Upper Confidence Bound-Bayesian Optimization (UCB-BO), a framework known for optimal evaluation-efficiency guarantees, to the language domain. Doing so is challenging for two reasons: (i) gradients needed for UCB-BO are ill-defined in discrete prompt space; and (ii) UCB-style exploration relies on a surrogate model and acquisition function, which only live implicitly in the LLM. We overcome these challenges by proving that combining simple textual gradients (LLM-proposed local edits) with the Best-of-N selection strategy statistically emulates ascent along the gradient of the canonical UCB acquisition function. Based on this result, we propose TextBO, a simple, evaluation-efficient self-improving algorithm that operates purely in language space without explicit surrogates or calibrated uncertainty models. We empirically validate TextBO on automated ad-alignment tasks using a persona-induced preference distribution, demonstrating superior performance per evaluation compared to strong baselines such as Best-of-N and GEPA. We also evaluate TextBO's Best-of-N multi-step textual-gradient mechanism on agentic AI benchmarks by augmenting GEPA with it and show that it significantly outperforms standard GEPA. In sum, TextBO is a simple and principled framework for AI self-improving system design that bridges prompt optimization with classical Bayesian optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is particularly challenging for complex, unstructured knowledge in lifelong settings, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two key properties enabling RILKE to achieve fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. At inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. Across LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE scales effectively to large-scale benchmarks, demonstrating high edit success and strong paraphrase generalization while preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically inspired CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logit computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing C.elegans Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing content-target and learnable time-constant gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. To improve efficiency and memory consumption, we implemented an adaptable subquadratic sparse Top-K pairwise concatenation mechanism that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability and bounded approximation errors. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory consumption compared with several CT state-of-the-art baselines, while being interpretable at the neuron cell level.</p>

<p>Abstract: Driven by surging submission volumes, scientific peer review has catalyzed two parallel trends: individual over-reliance on LLMs and institutional AI-powered assessment systems. This study investigates the robustness of "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems to adversarial PDF manipulation via invisible text injections and layout aware encoding attacks. We specifically target the distinct incentive of flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," a vulnerability that fundamentally compromises scientific integrity. To measure this, we introduce the Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score (WAVS), a novel metric that quantifies susceptibility by weighting score inflation against the severity of decision shifts relative to ground truth. We adapt 15 domain-specific attack strategies, ranging from semantic persuasion to cognitive obfuscation, and evaluate them across 13 diverse language models (including GPT-5 and DeepSeek) using a curated dataset of 200 official and real-world accepted and rejected submissions (e.g., ICLR OpenReview). Our results demonstrate that obfuscation techniques like "Maximum Mark Magyk" and "Symbolic Masking & Context Redirection" successfully manipulate scores, achieving decision flip rates of up to 86.26% in open-source models, while exposing distinct "reasoning traps" in proprietary systems. We release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on the topic (https://anonymous.4open.sciencer/llm-jailbreak-FC9E/).</p>

We study this skill in reasoning-heavy domains where progress depends on inquiry rather than factual recall. We define an interactive protocol where a student model engages a stronger teacher under a small turn budget. After each teacher reply, we evaluate the student on the original task with Pass@k. We propose Outcome-Driven Question optimization Strategy (ODQS ), a training framework that learns a questioning policy from downstream task outcomes. At each turn, we sample multiple candidate questions; query the teacher with each, then score the student's resulting performance. Using these scores, we train the student via supervised fine-tuning followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), without any human labels. On GSM8K, HumanEval, and OpenCoder, ODQS produces large gains over interactive baselines, boosting Pass@5 by up to 54.7% (absolute) on math and 22.9% (absolute) on coding, and matching baseline performance in three fewer turns. Thus, question asking can be explicitly trained from task outcomes, improving both accuracy and efficiency in interactive reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wentao Wan, Qiqing Lao, Zhiwei Xie, Hefeng Wu, Runnan Lin, Liang Lin, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingjie Zhao, Xue Yu, Yongzhi Qi, Hao Hu, Jianshen Zhang, Yingzheng Ma, Shuyu Han, Wei Qi, Zuo-Jun Max Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the pursuit of synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) gains momentum in handling complex inventory systems, a critical challenge persists: how to effectively reconcile AI's adaptive perception with OR's structural rigor. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided "Pretrain-then-Reinforce" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the development and optimization of PayPal's Commerce Agent, powered by NEMO-4-PAYPAL, a multi-agent system designed to revolutionize agentic commerce on the PayPal platform. Through our strategic partnership with NVIDIA, we leveraged the NeMo Framework for LLM model fine-tuning to enhance agent performance. Specifically, we optimized the Search and Discovery agent by replacing our base model with a fine-tuned Nemotron small language model (SLM).
  We conducted comprehensive experiments using the llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 architecture, training LoRA-based models through systematic hyperparameter sweeps across learning rates, optimizers (Adam, AdamW), cosine annealing schedules, and LoRA ranks. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of NVIDIA's NeMo Framework to commerce-specific agent optimization, (2) LLM powered fine-tuning strategy for retrieval-focused commerce tasks, (3) demonstration of significant improvements in latency and cost while maintaining agent quality, and (4) a scalable framework for multi-agent system optimization in production e-commerce environments. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Nemotron SLM effectively resolves the key performance issue in the retrieval component, which represents over 50\% of total agent response time, while maintaining or enhancing overall system performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonpyo Lee, Kazuma Kobayashi, Sai Puppala, Sajedul Talukder, Seid Koric, Souvik Chakraborty, Syed Bahauddin Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongwei Wang, Bincheng Gu, Hongyu Yu, Junliang Yu, Tao He, Jiayin Feng, Chenghua Lin, Min Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper reveals that LLM-powered agents exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias under minimal "us" versus "them" cues. When such group boundaries align with the agent-human divide, a new bias risk emerges: agents may treat other AI agents as the ingroup and humans as the outgroup. To examine this risk, we conduct a controlled multi-agent social simulation and find that agents display consistent intergroup bias in an all-agent setting. More critically, this bias persists even in human-facing interactions when agents are uncertain about whether the counterpart is truly human, revealing a belief-dependent fragility in bias suppression toward humans. Motivated by this observation, we identify a new attack surface rooted in identity beliefs and formalize a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that can manipulate agent identity beliefs and induce outgroup bias toward humans. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the prevalence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings, while also showing that our proposed defenses can mitigate the risk. These findings are expected to inform safer agent design and motivate more robust safeguards for human-facing agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao An</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversation summarization loses nuanced details: when asked about coding preferences after 40 turns, summarization recalls "use type hints" but drops the critical constraint "everywhere" (19.0% exact match vs. 93.0% for our approach).
  We present CogCanvas, a training-free framework inspired by how teams use whiteboards to anchor shared memory. Rather than compressing conversation history, CogCanvas extracts verbatim-grounded artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) and retrieves them via temporal-aware graph.
  On the LoCoMo benchmark (all 10 conversations from the ACL 2024 release), CogCanvas achieves the highest overall accuracy among training-free methods (32.4%), outperforming RAG (24.6%) by +7.8pp, with decisive advantages on complex reasoning tasks: +20.6pp on temporal reasoning (32.7% vs. 12.1% RAG) and +1.1pp on multi-hop questions (41.7% vs. 40.6% RAG). CogCanvas also leads on single-hop retrieval (26.6% vs. 24.6% RAG). Ablation studies reveal that BGE reranking contributes +7.7pp, making it the largest contributor to CogCanvas's performance.
  While heavily-optimized approaches achieve higher absolute scores through dedicated training (EverMemOS: ~92%), our training-free approach provides practitioners with an immediately-deployable alternative that significantly outperforms standard baselines.

<p>Abstract: To develop a reliable AI for psychological assessment, we introduce \texttt{PsychEval}, a multi-session, multi-therapy, and highly realistic benchmark designed to address three key challenges: \textbf{1) Can we train a highly realistic AI counselor?} Realistic counseling is a longitudinal task requiring sustained memory and dynamic goal tracking. We propose a multi-session benchmark (spanning 6-10 sessions across three distinct stages) that demands critical capabilities such as memory continuity, adaptive reasoning, and longitudinal planning. The dataset is annotated with extensive professional skills, comprising over 677 meta-skills and 4577 atomic skills. \textbf{2) How to train a multi-therapy AI counselor?} While existing models often focus on a single therapy, complex cases frequently require flexible strategies among various therapies. We construct a diverse dataset covering five therapeutic modalities (Psychodynamic, Behaviorism, CBT, Humanistic Existentialist, and Postmodernist) alongside an integrative therapy with a unified three-stage clinical framework across six core psychological topics. \textbf{3) How to systematically evaluate an AI counselor?} We establish a holistic evaluation framework with 18 therapy-specific and therapy-shared metrics across Client-Level and Counselor-Level dimensions. To support this, we also construct over 2,000 diverse client profiles. Extensive experimental analysis fully validates the superior quality and clinical fidelity of our dataset. Crucially, \texttt{PsychEval} transcends static benchmarking to serve as a high-fidelity reinforcement learning environment that enables the self-evolutionary training of clinically responsible and adaptive AI counselors.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel optimization problem formulation that departs from the conventional way of minimizing machine learning model loss as a black-box function. Unlike traditional formulations, the proposed approach explicitly incorporates an initially pre-trained model and random sketch operators, allowing for sparsification of both the model and gradient during training. We establish the insightful properties of the proposed objective function and highlight its connections to the standard formulation. Furthermore, we present several variants of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method adapted to the new problem formulation, including SGD with general sampling, a distributed version, and SGD with variance reduction techniques. We achieve tighter convergence rates and relax assumptions, bridging the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, covering several important techniques such as Dropout and Sparse training. This work presents promising opportunities to enhance the theoretical understanding of model training through a sparsification-aware optimization approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuansan Liu, Sudanthi Wijewickrema, Ang Li, Christofer Bester, Stephen O'Leary, James Bailey</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating time series data is a promising approach to address data deficiency problems. However, it is also challenging due to the complex temporal properties of time series data, including local correlations as well as global dependencies. Most existing generative models have failed to effectively learn both the local and global properties of time series data. To address this open problem, we propose a novel time series generative model named 'Time-Transformer AAE', which consists of an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) and a newly designed architecture named 'Time-Transformer' within the decoder. The Time-Transformer first simultaneously learns local and global features in a layer-wise parallel design, combining the abilities of Temporal Convolutional Networks and Transformer in extracting local features and global dependencies respectively. Second, a bidirectional cross attention is proposed to provide complementary guidance across the two branches and achieve proper fusion between local and global features. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can outperform existing state-of-the-art models in 5 out of 6 datasets, specifically on those with data containing both global and local properties. Furthermore, we highlight our model's advantage on handling this kind of data via an artificial dataset. Finally, we show our model's ability to address a real-world problem: data augmentation to support learning with small datasets and imbalanced datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to its integration into various areas, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhancing capabilities in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). However, the complexity of AI systems has also exposed their vulnerabilities, necessitating robust methods for failure analysis (FA) and fault injection (FI) to ensure resilience and reliability. Despite the importance of these techniques, there lacks a comprehensive review of FA and FI methodologies in AI systems. This study fills this gap by presenting a detailed survey of existing FA and FI approaches across six layers of AI systems. We systematically analyze 160 papers and repositories to answer three research questions including (1) what are the prevalent failures in AI systems, (2) what types of faults can current FI tools simulate, (3) what gaps exist between the simulated faults and real-world failures. Our findings reveal a taxonomy of AI system failures, assess the capabilities of existing FI tools, and highlight discrepancies between real-world and simulated failures. Moreover, this survey contributes to the field by providing a framework for fault diagnosis, evaluating the state-of-the-art in FI, and identifying areas for improvement in FI techniques to enhance the resilience of AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jarne Verhaeghe, Jef Jonkers, Sofie Van Hoecke</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the dose-response relation between a continuous treatment and the outcome for an individual can greatly drive decision-making, particularly in areas like personalized drug dosing and personalized healthcare interventions. Point estimates are often insufficient in these high-risk environments, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification to support informed decisions. Conformal prediction, a distribution-free and model-agnostic method for uncertainty quantification, has seen limited application in continuous treatments or dose-response models. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology that frames the causal dose-response problem as a covariate shift, leveraging weighted conformal prediction. By incorporating propensity estimation, conformal predictive systems, and likelihood ratios, we present a practical solution for generating prediction intervals for dose-response models. Additionally, our method approximates local coverage for every treatment value by applying kernel functions as weights in weighted conformal prediction. Finally, we use a new synthetic benchmark dataset to demonstrate the significance of covariate shift assumptions in achieving robust prediction intervals for dose-response models.</p>

We study how this is done under the sociological framework of social balance, which explains the emergence of one faction or multiple antagonistic ones among agents. Across different LLM models, we find that balance depends on the (i) type of interaction, (ii) update mechanism, and (iii) population size. Across (i)-(iii), we characterize the frequency at which social balance is achieved, the justifications for the social dynamics, and the diversity and stability of interactions. Finally, we explain how our findings inform the deployment of agentic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have pushed the frontier of artificial intelligence but are comprised of hundreds of billions of parameters and operations. For faster inference latency, LLMs are deployed on multiple hardware accelerators through various Model Parallelism strategies. Our paper looks into the details on one such strategy - Tensor Parallel - and proposes to reduce latency by compressing inter-accelerator communication. We leverage fine grained quantization techniques to compress selected activations by 3.5 - 4.5x. Our proposed method leads up to 2x reduction of time-to-first-token (TTFT) with negligible model performance degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li</p>
<p>Abstract: To reduce memory consumption during LLM inference, prior works have proposed numerous methods that focus on KV cache pruning based on various criteria. While these techniques often accomplish lossless memory reduction on many datasets, they often rely on an under-emphasized condition: a dataset/domain-specific budget size threshold needs to be pre-determined to achieve the optimal performance. However, such input-specific tuning may be considerably limited in real-world scenarios, as open-domain inputs span diverse domains, lengths and difficulty levels, without clear boundaries for pre-tuning. Thus, the dependence of an input-sensitive threshold can be an inherent limitation that may cause large degradation on arbitrary inputs. In this work, we propose a new objective that lifts the threshold constraints for robust KV pruning, calling for "threshold-free" methods that automatically adjust budget sizes while ensuring full-cache performance. We then propose a novel method ReFreeKV as the first solution fulfilling this objective, validated by intensive experiments on 13 datasets of diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and agentic, the requirement for trust in their outputs grows significantly, yet at the same time concerns have been mounting that models may learn to lie in pursuit of their goals. To address these concerns, a body of work has emerged around the notion of "honesty" in LLMs, along with interventions aimed at mitigating deceptive behaviors. However, some benchmarks claiming to measure honesty in fact simply measure accuracy--the correctness of a model's beliefs--in disguise. Moreover, no benchmarks currently exist for directly measuring whether language models lie. In this work, we introduce a large-scale human-collected dataset for directly measuring lying, allowing us to disentangle accuracy from honesty. Across a diverse set of LLMs, we find that while larger models obtain higher accuracy on our benchmark, they do not become more honest. Surprisingly, most frontier LLMs obtain high scores on truthfulness benchmarks yet exhibit a substantial propensity to lie under pressure, resulting in low honesty scores on our benchmark. We find that simple methods, such as representation engineering interventions, can improve honesty. These results underscore the growing need for robust evaluations and effective interventions to ensure LLMs remain trustworthy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liming Lu, Xiang Gu, Shuchao Pang, Siyuan Liang, Haotian Zhu, Xiyu Zeng, Xu Zheng, Yongbin Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Research endeavors have been made in learning robust Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) against jailbreak attacks. However, existing methods for improving MLLMs' robustness still face critical challenges: \ding{172} how to efficiently tune massive weight parameters and \ding{173} how to ensure robustness against attacks across both visual and textual modalities. To this end, we propose an \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{E}nd-to-end \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{T}raining (E$^2$AT) framework for both visual and textual adversarial attacks. Specifically, for the visual aspect, E$^2$AT incorporates an efficient projector-based AT module that aligns the attack samples at the feature level. For training objectives, we propose a Dynamic Joint Multimodal Optimization (DJMO) strategy to enhance generalization ability against jailbreak attacks by dynamically adjusting weights between normal and adversarial objectives. Extensive experiments are conducted with five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs. Results demonstrate that our E$^2$AT achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of 34\% across text and image modalities, while maintaining clean task performance. Furthermore, evaluations of real-world embodied intelligent systems highlight the practical applicability of E$^2$AT, paving the way for the development of more secure and reliable multimodal systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sergey Berezin, Reza Farahbakhsh, Noel Crespi</p>
<p>Abstract: Most toxicity detection models treat toxicity as an intrinsic property of text, overlooking the role of context in shaping its impact. In this position paper, drawing on insights from psychology, neuroscience, and computational social science, we reconceptualise toxicity as a socially emergent signal of stress. We formalise this perspective in the Contextual Stress Framework (CSF), which defines toxicity as a stress-inducing norm violation within a given context and introduces an additional dimension for toxicity detection. As one possible realisation of CSF, we introduce PONOS (Proportion Of Negative Observed Sentiments), a metric that quantifies toxicity through collective social reception rather than lexical features. We validate this approach on a novel dataset, demonstrating improved contextual sensitivity and adaptability when used alongside existing models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyue Qin, Shichang Zhang, Mingxuan Ju, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Yizhou Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Link prediction is a crucial graph-learning task with applications including citation prediction and product recommendation. Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hussein Harb, Didier Benoit, Axel Rannou, Chi-Hieu Pham, Valentin Tissot, Bahaa Nasr, Julien Bert</p>
<p>Abstract: To develop a machine learning-based framework for accurately modeling the anode heel effect in Monte Carlo simulations of X-ray imaging systems, enabling realistic beam intensity profiles with minimal experimental calibration. Multiple regression models were trained to predict spatial intensity variations along the anode-cathode axis using experimentally acquired weights derived from beam measurements across different tube potentials. These weights captured the asymmetry introduced by the anode heel effect. A systematic fine-tuning protocol was established to minimize the number of required measurements while preserving model accuracy. The models were implemented in the OpenGATE 10 and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits to evaluate their integration feasibility and predictive performance. Among the tested models, gradient boosting regression (GBR) delivered the highest accuracy, with prediction errors remaining below 5% across all energy levels. The optimized fine-tuning strategy required only six detector positions per energy level, reducing measurement effort by 65%. The maximum error introduced through this fine-tuning process remained below 2%. Dose actor comparisons within Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the GBR-based model closely replicated clinical beam profiles and significantly outperformed conventional symmetric beam models. This study presents a robust and generalizable method for incorporating the anode heel effect into Monte Carlo simulations using machine learning. By enabling accurate, energy-dependent beam modeling with limited calibration data, the approach enhances simulation realism for applications in clinical dosimetry, image quality assessment, and radiation protection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woongyeong Yeo, Kangsan Kim, Soyeong Jeong, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in improving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge relevant to queries. However, most existing approaches are limited to a text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space derived from a single aggregated corpus causes a modality gap, where the retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose modality-aware routing, which dynamically identifies the most appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it, and further justify its effectiveness with a theoretical analysis. Moreover, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 10 benchmarks of multiple modalities, showing its superiority over various modality-specific and unified baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neeloy Chakraborty, John Pohovey, Melkior Ornik, Katherine Driggs-Campbell</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in decision-making tasks including planning, control, and prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs poses risks. This unwanted behavior is further exacerbated in environments where sensors are noisy or unreliable. Characterizing the behavior of LLM planners to varied observations is necessary to proactively avoid failures in safety-critical scenarios. We specifically investigate the response of LLMs along two different perturbation dimensions. Like prior works, one dimension generates semantically similar prompts with varied phrasing by randomizing order of details, modifying access to few-shot examples, etc. Unique to our work, the second dimension simulates access to varied sensors and noise to mimic raw sensor or detection algorithm failures. An initial case study in which perturbations are manually applied show that both dimensions lead LLMs to hallucinate in a multi-agent driving environment. However, manually covering the entire perturbation space for several scenarios is infeasible. As such, we propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt perturbations using adaptive stress testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios, sensor configurations, and prompt phrasing that cause language models to act with high uncertainty or even crash. By generating MCTS prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show through extensive experiments that offline analyses can be used to proactively understand potential failures that may arise at runtime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Li, Ming Lin, Tomer Galanti, Zhengzhong Tu, Tianbao Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach, yielding long and stable training dynamics; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for a 1.5B model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lior Broide, Roni Stern, Argaman Mordoch</p>
<p>Abstract: Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is a well-established approach for automated unit test generation, yet it often suffers from premature convergence and limited diversity in the generated test suites. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative technique for unit test generation. We present EvoGPT, a hybrid test generation system that integrates LLM-based test generation with SBST-based test suite optimization. EvoGPT uses LLMs to generate an initial population of test suites, and uses an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to further optimize this test suite population. A distinguishing feature of EvoGPT is its explicit enforcement of diversity, achieved through the use of multiple temperatures and prompt instructions during test generation. In addition, each LLM-generated test is refined using a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion generation. To address evolutionary plateaus, EvoGPT also detects stagnation during search and injects additional LLM-generated tests aimed at previously uncovered branches. Here too diversity is enforced using multiple temperatures and prompt instructions. We evaluate EvoGPT on Defects4J, a standard benchmark for test generation. The results show that EvoGPT achieves, on average, a 10\% improvement in both code coverage and mutation score metrics compared to TestART, an LLM-only baseline; and EvoSuite, a standard SBST baseline. An ablation study indicates that explicitly enforcing diversity both at initialization and during the search is key to effectively leveraging LLMs for automated unit test generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berk Atil, Namrata Sureddy, Rebecca J. Passonneau</p>
<p>Abstract: Toxic language includes content that is offensive, abusive, or that promotes harm. Progress in preventing toxic output from large language models (LLMs) is hampered by inconsistent definitions of toxicity. We introduce TRuST, a large-scale dataset that unifies and expands prior resources through a carefully synthesized definition of toxicity, and corresponding annotation scheme. It consists of ~300k annotations, with high-quality human annotation on ~11k. To ensure high-quality, we designed a rigorous, multi-stage human annotation process, and evaluated the diversity of the annotators. Then we benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs and pre-trained models on three tasks: toxicity detection, identification of the target group, and of toxic words. Our results indicate that fine-tuned PLMs outperform LLMs on the three tasks, and that current reasoning models do not reliably improve performance. TRuST constitutes one of the most comprehensive resources for evaluating and mitigating LLM toxicity, and other research in socially-aware and safer language technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nina Cai, Jinguang Han, Weizhi Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without exposing local client data, thereby protecting data privacy. However, it also brings new threats and challenges. The advancement of model inversion attacks has rendered the plaintext transmission of local models insecure, while the distributed nature of federated learning makes it particularly vulnerable to attacks raised by malicious clients. To protect data privacy and prevent malicious client attacks, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving Federated Learning framework based on Verifiable Functional Encryption (VFEFL), without a non-colluding dual-server assumption or additional trusted third-party. Specifically, we propose a novel Cross-Ciphertext Decentralized Verifiable Functional Encryption (CC-DVFE) scheme that enables the verification of specific relationships over multi-dimensional ciphertexts. This scheme is formally treated, in terms of definition, security model and security proof. Furthermore, based on the proposed CC-DVFE scheme, we design a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that incorporates a novel robust aggregation rule to detect malicious clients, enabling the effective training of high-accuracy models under adversarial settings. Finally, we provide the formal analysis and empirical evaluation of VFEFL. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the desired privacy protection, robustness, verifiability and fidelity, while eliminating the reliance on non-colluding dual-server assumption or trusted third parties required by most existing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hexiang Gu, Qifan Yu, Yuan Liu, Zikang Li, Saihui Hou, Jian Zhao, Zhaofeng He</p>
<p>Abstract: As a multimodal medium combining images and text, memes frequently convey implicit harmful content through metaphors and humor, rendering the detection of harmful memes a complex and challenging task. Although recent studies have made progress in detection accuracy and interpretability, large-scale, high-quality datasets for harmful memes remain scarce, and current methods still struggle to capture implicit risks and nuanced semantics. Thus, we construct MemeMind, a large-scale harmful meme dataset. Aligned with the international standards and the context of internet, MemeMind provides detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning annotations to support fine-grained analysis of implicit intentions in memes. Based on this dataset, we further propose MemeGuard, a reasoning-oriented multimodal detection model that significantly improves both the accuracy of harmful meme detection and the interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MemeGuard outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the MemeMind dataset, establishing a solid foundation for future research in harmful meme detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world, knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline, MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities, covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge gaps, handle rare entities, and either proactively guide the interaction or respond.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Lavoie, Michael Noukhovitch, Aaron Courville</p>
<p>Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is, for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, accompanied by a growing number of evaluation benchmarks. However, most existing benchmarks emphasize task completion and capability scaling, while remaining poorly aligned with how users interact with SLMs in real-world spoken conversations. Effective spoken interaction requires not only accurate understanding of user intent and content, but also the ability to respond with appropriate interactional strategies. In this paper, we present TELEVAL, a dynamic, user-centered benchmark for evaluating SLMs in realistic Chinese spoken interaction scenarios. TELEVAL consolidates evaluation into two core aspects. Reliable Content Fulfillment assesses whether models can comprehend spoken inputs and produce semantically correct responses. Interactional Appropriateness evaluates whether models act as socially capable interlocutors, requiring them not only to generate human-like, colloquial responses, but also to implicitly incorporate paralinguistic cues for natural interaction. Experiments reveal that, despite strong performance on semantic and knowledge-oriented tasks, current SLMs still struggle to produce natural and interactionally appropriate responses, highlighting the need for more interaction-faithful evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhu, Yuexing Peng, Peng Wang, George C. Alexandropoulos, Wenbo Wang, Wei Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate radar cross section (RCS) computation is a fundamental task in radar engineering and electromagnetic (EM) scattering analysis, underpinning target signature characterization, detection, and recognition. Conventional computational electromagnetics (CEM) solvers provide high-fidelity RCS predictions but suffer from prohibitive computational costs when applied to 3-dimensional (3D) targets under multi-aspect configurations. In contrast, purely data-driven neural networks offer high efficiency yet often lack physical consistency and generalization capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to establish a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical architecture for fast and accurate RCS computation, grounded in the governing principles of CEM. Inspired by the near-far field decomposition in classical fast solvers, U-PINet explicitly models local EM coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design. A physics-guided graph construction is further introduced to represent self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex 3D targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding EM governing equations as residual constraints, the proposed framework achieves end-to-end, physically consistent RCS prediction with significantly improved computational efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet attains solver-level RCS accuracy with orders-of-magnitude runtime reduction, while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen target geometries under limited training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanling Zhang, Yayu Zhou, Tongcheng Fang, Zhihang Yuan, Guohao Dai, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid, one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle, the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static vocabulary pruning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan Yin, Shashanka Venkataramanan, Tuan-Hung Vu, Andrei Bursuc, Matthieu Cord</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However, LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly aims to reconstruct the original input within a reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters when the projection is frozen.

<p>Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy. Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the learned defender strategy and the required training time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian Gao, Zongyun Zhang, Ting Liu, Yuzhuo Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: In online learning environments, students often lack personalized peer interactions, which are crucial for cognitive development and learning engagement. Although previous studies have employed large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive learning environments, these interactions are limited to conversational exchanges, failing to adapt to learners' individualized cognitive and psychological states. As a result, students' engagement is low and they struggle to gain inspiration. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs integrated with Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate simulates peer-like roles, infers learners' psychological states such as misunderstandings and confusion during collaborative discussions, and dynamically adjusts interaction strategies to support higher-order thinking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stelios Katsis, Vassilis Lyberatos, Spyridon Kantarelis, Edmund Dervakos, Giorgos Stamou</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio effects (FX) such as reverberation, distortion, modulation, and dynamic range processing play a pivotal role in shaping emotional responses during music listening. While prior studies have examined links between low-level audio features and affective perception, the systematic impact of audio FX on emotion remains underexplored. This work investigates how foundation models - large-scale neural architectures pretrained on multimodal data - can be leveraged to analyze these effects. Such models encode rich associations between musical structure, timbre, and affective meaning, offering a powerful framework for probing the emotional consequences of sound design techniques. By applying various probing methods to embeddings from deep learning models, we examine the complex, nonlinear relationships between audio FX and estimated emotion, uncovering patterns tied to specific effects and evaluating the robustness of foundation audio models. Our findings aim to advance understanding of the perceptual impact of audio production practices, with implications for music cognition, performance, and affective computing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tom Burgert, Oliver Stoll, Paolo Rota, Beg\"um Demir</p>
<p>Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luca Zhou, Pratham Yashwante, Marshall Fisher, Alessio Sampieri, Zihao Zhou, Fabio Galasso, Rose Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing time series in natural language, requires numeric and temporal reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on fully synthetic or generic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. We introduce \textbf{CaTS-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{a}ware \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries reasoning across $11$ diverse domains, centered on a gold-standard evaluation set of $1746$ human-rewritten captions that measure how effectively models translate numeric trends into immediately interpretable narratives. To address the scarcity of human-annotated data, we also propose a scalable pipeline for generating high-fidelity synthetic captions, the quality of which we validate. We evaluate leading Vision-Language Models on our benchmark, revealing that even proprietary models struggle to capture numeric nuances in temporal descriptions, while finetuning open-source models on synthetic data yields substantial performance gains. Finally, release a diagnostic suite of $910$ multiple-choice questions and tailored numeric metrics to gauge time-series-specific reasoning capabilities, establishing CaTS-Bench as a reliable foundation for grounded, multimodal language generation in numeric domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and English audio data and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce CMDAR, a Chinese benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. CMDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on CMDAR and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. In CMDAR-main, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves 76.67% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o Audio reaches 68.47%. However, GPT-4o Audio substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice with multiple audios and open-ended tasks. And we provide detail analysis corresponding suggestions for the future development of large audio language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeonghyun Park, Ingeol Baek, Seunghyun Yoon, Haeun Jang, Aparna Garimella, Akriti Jain, Nedim Lipka, Hwanhee Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world multi-hop QA is naturally linked with ambiguity, where a single query can trigger multiple reasoning paths that require independent resolution. Since ambiguity can occur at any stage, models must navigate layered uncertainty throughout the entire reasoning chain. Despite its prevalence in real-world user queries, previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-hop ambiguity, leaving the complex interaction between multi-step inference and layered ambiguity underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MARCH}, a benchmark for their intersection, with 2,209 multi-hop ambiguous questions curated via multi-LLM verification and validated by human annotation with strong agreement. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models struggle with MARCH, confirming that combining ambiguity resolution with multi-step reasoning is a significant challenge. To address this, we propose \textbf{CLARION}, a two-stage agentic framework that explicitly decouples ambiguity planning from evidence-driven reasoning, significantly outperforms existing approaches, and paves the way for robust reasoning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixuan Gong, Yong Liu, Jiaye Teng</p>
<p>Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the mechanism for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep). Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley. This inductive bias suggest a better loss convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical Framework for Progressive Training), a principled training strategy that accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable performances.</p>

<p>Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless, they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification. After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments, we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Brady, Tunazzina Islam</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse, but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically inducing an interpretable topic taxonomy from unlabeled text corpora. By combining unsupervised clustering with prompt-based inference, our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring seed sets (predefined labels) or domain expertise. We validate the framework through a study of political advertising ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The induced taxonomy yields semantically rich topic labels and supports downstream analyses, including moral framing, in this setting. Results suggest that structured, iterative labeling yields more consistent and interpretable topic labels than existing approaches under human evaluation, and is practical for analyzing large-scale political advertising data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, tasks are refined only when conflicts with observations are detected, which mitigates hallucinations while preserving task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Loi</p>
<p>Abstract: Academic publishing increasingly requires authors to disclose AI assistance, yet imposes reputational costs for doing so--especially when such assistance is substantial. This article analyzes that structural contradiction, showing how incentives discourage transparency in precisely the work where it matters most. Traditional venues cannot resolve this tension through policy tweaks alone, as the underlying prestige economy rewards opacity. To address this, the article proposes an alternative publishing infrastructure: a venue outside prestige systems that enforces mandatory disclosure, enables reproduction-based review, and supports ecological validity through detailed documentation. As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars. While focused on AI, the framework speaks to broader questions about how academic systems handle methodological innovation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhu, Yuexing Peng, George C. Alexandropoulos, Wenbo Wang, Wei Xiang</p>
<p>Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current face de-identification methods that replace identifiable cues in the face region with other sacrifices utilities contributing to realism, such as age and gender. To retrieve the damaged realism, we present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a single-input face de-identification framework that directly replaces identity features in the latent space of a pretrained diffusion model without affecting the model's weights. We reinterpret face de-identification as an image editing task in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework estimates identity-editing directions through optimization guided by loss functions that encourage attribute preservation while suppressing identity signals. We further introduce both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ show that FLUID achieves a superior balance between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming existing de-identification approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaye Qian, Ge Zheng, Yuchen Zhu, Sibei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding complete musical scores entails integrated reasoning over pitch, rhythm, harmony, and large-scale structure, yet the ability of Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models to interpret full musical notation remains insufficiently examined. We introduce the Musical Score Understanding Benchmark (MSU-Bench), the first large-scale, human-curated benchmark for score-level musical understanding across textual (ABC notation) and visual (PDF) modalities. MSU-Bench contains 1,800 generative Question-Answering pairs from works by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Debussy, and others, organised into four levels of increasing difficulty, ranging from onset information to texture and form. Evaluations of more than fifteen state-of-the-art models, in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, reveal pronounced modality gaps, unstable level-wise performance, and challenges in maintaining multilevel correctness. Fine-tuning substantially improves results across modalities while preserving general knowledge, positioning MSU-Bench as a robust foundation for future research in multimodal reasoning. To facilitate further research, we publicly release MSU-Bench and all associated resources.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anup Roy, Rishabh Gyanendra Upadhyay, Animesh Rameshbhai Panara, Robin Mills, Aidan Millar</p>
<p>Abstract: Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.
  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.
  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Theologitis, Dan Suciu</p>
<p>Abstract: In today's age, it is becoming increasingly difficult to decipher truth from lies. Every day, politicians, media outlets, and public figures make conflicting claims -- often about topics that can, in principle, be verified against structured data. For instance, statements about crime rates, economic growth or healthcare can all be verified against official public records and structured datasets. Building a system that can automatically do that would have sounded like science fiction just a few years ago. Yet, with the extraordinary progress in LLMs and agentic AI, this is now within reach. Still, there remains a striking gap between what is technically possible and what is being demonstrated by recent work. Most existing verification systems operate only on small, single-table databases -- typically a few hundred rows -- that conveniently fit within an LLM's context window.
  In this paper we report our progress on Thucy, the first cross-database, cross-table multi-agent claim verification system that also provides concrete evidence for each verification verdict. Thucy remains completely agnostic to the underlying data sources before deployment and must therefore autonomously discover, inspect, and reason over all available relational databases to verify claims. Importantly, Thucy also reports the exact SQL queries that support its verdict (whether the claim is accurate or not) offering full transparency to expert users familiar with SQL. When evaluated on the TabFact dataset -- the standard benchmark for fact verification over structured data -- Thucy surpasses the previous state of the art by 5.6 percentage points in accuracy (94.3% vs. 88.7%).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengqian Lu, Jie Lu, Anjin Liu, Guangquan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation remains a challenge. Prior approaches attribute hallucinations to a binary conflict between internal knowledge stored in FFNs and the retrieved context. However, this perspective is incomplete, failing to account for the impact of other components of the LLM, such as the user query, previously generated tokens, the self token, and the final LayerNorm adjustment. To comprehensively capture the impact of these components on hallucination detection, we propose TPA which mathematically attributes each token's probability to seven distinct sources: Query, RAG Context, Past Token, Self Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the next token. Specifically, we aggregate these attribution scores by Part-of-Speech (POS) tags to quantify the contribution of each model component to the generation of specific linguistic categories within a response. By leveraging these patterns, such as detecting anomalies where Nouns rely heavily on LayerNorm, TPA effectively identifies hallucinated responses. Extensive experiments show that TPA achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yijiong Yu, Jiale Liu, Qingyun Wu, Huazheng Wang, Ji Pei</p>
<p>Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) renders long-context inference prohibitively expensive. While Sliding Window Attention (SWA), the simplest sparse attention pattern, offers a linear-complexity alternative, naively applying it to models pretrained with Full Attention (FA) causes catastrophic long-context performance collapse due to the training-inference mismatch. To address this, we propose Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a plug-and-play toolkit of recipes that adapt FA models to SWA without costly pretraining. SWAA systematically combines five strategies: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that while individual methods are insufficient, specific synergistic combinations can effectively recover original long-context capabilities. After further analyzing performance-efficiency trade-offs, we identify recommended SWAA configurations for diverse scenarios, which achieve 30% to 100% speedups for long-context LLM inference with acceptable quality loss.

<p>Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Karvonen, James Chua, Cl\'ement Dumas, Kit Fraser-Taliente, Subhash Kantamneni, Julian Minder, Euan Ong, Arnab Sen Sharma, Daniel Wen, Owain Evans, Samuel Marks</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Our best AOs match or exceed white-box baselines on all four tasks and the best overall baseline on 3 of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueru Yan, Tuc Nguyen, Bo Su, Melissa Lieffers, Thai Le</p>
<p>Abstract: While academic research typically treats Large Language Models (LLM) as generic text generators, they are distinct commercial products with unique interfaces and capabilities that fundamentally shape user behavior. Current datasets obscure this reality by collecting text-only data through uniform interfaces that fail to capture authentic chatbot usage. To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale corpus of 142,808 conversations (660,293 turns) sourced directly from publicly shared URLs on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, and Claude. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances, such as citations and thinking traces, across a diverse collection covering 101 languages and the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. To illustrate the dataset's breadth, we present three case studies: a completeness analysis of intent satisfaction, a citation study of model grounding, and a temporal analysis of engagement rhythms. This work provides the community with a vital and timely resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions in the wild. The dataset will be publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Ge, Jiuxin Cao, Xinyi Li, Xuelin Zhu, Chang Liu, Bo Liu, Chen Feng, Ioannis Patras</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ying Zhu, Jiaxin Wan, Xiaoran Liu, Siyang He, Qiqi Wang, Xu Guo, Tianyi Liang, Zengfeng Huang, Ziwei He, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaofei Cai, Yulei Qin, Haojia Lin, Zihan Xu, Gang Li, Yuchen Shi, Zongyi Li, Yong Mao, Siqi Cai, Xiaoyu Tan, Yitao Liang, Ke Li, Xing Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Le Shen, Qian Qiao, Tan Yu, Ke Zhou, Tianhang Yu, Yu Zhan, Zhenjie Wang, Ming Tao, Shunshun Yin, Siyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-FlashTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-FlashTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.</p>

In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yohan Park, Hyunwoo Ha, Wonjun Jo, Tae-Hyun Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Project website: https://darkeqa-benchmark.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: Production LLM agents with tool-using capabilities require security testing despite their safety training. We adapt Go-Explore to evaluate GPT-4o-mini across 28 experimental runs spanning six research questions. We find that random-seed variance dominates algorithmic parameters, yielding an 8x spread in outcomes; single-seed comparisons are unreliable, while multi-seed averaging materially reduces variance in our setup. Reward shaping consistently harms performance, causing exploration collapse in 94% of runs or producing 18 false positives with zero verified attacks. In our environment, simple state signatures outperform complex ones. For comprehensive security testing, ensembles provide attack-type diversity, whereas single agents optimize coverage within a given attack type. Overall, these results suggest that seed variance and targeted domain knowledge can outweigh algorithmic sophistication when testing safety-trained models.</p>

<p>Abstract: As multimodal AI becomes widely used for credit risk assessment and document review, a domain-specific benchmark is urgently needed that (1) reflects documents and workflows specific to financial credit applications, (2) includes credit-specific understanding and real-world robustness, and (3) preserves privacy compliance without sacrificing practical utility. Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92). Robustness evaluations show that even top-performing models suffer noticeable performance drops under acquisition artifacts.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Interpretability-Guided Bi-objective Optimization (IGBO), a framework that trains interpretable models by incorporating structured domain knowledge via a bi-objective formulation. IGBO encodes feature importance hierarchies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via Central Limit Theorem-based construction and uses Temporal Integrated Gradients (TIG) to measure feature importance. To address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in TIG computation, we propose an Optimal Path Oracle that learns data-manifold-aware integration paths. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence properties via a geometric projection mapping $\mathcal{P}$ and proves robustness to mini-batch noise. Central Limit Theorem-based construction of the interpretability DAG ensures statistical validity of edge orientation decisions. Empirical results on time-series data demonstrate IGBO's effectiveness in enforcing DAG constraints with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming standard regularization baselines.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01014">Geometric and Dynamic Scaling in Deep Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Su, Chenyu You</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their empirical success, pushing Transformer architectures to extreme depth often leads to a paradoxical failure: representations become increasingly redundant, lose rank, and ultimately collapse. Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ML-UCB, a generalized upper confidence bound algorithm that integrates arbitrary machine learning models into multi-armed bandit frameworks. A fundamental challenge in deploying sophisticated ML models for sequential decision-making is the lack of tractable concentration inequalities required for principled exploration. We overcome this limitation by directly modeling the learning curve behavior of the underlying estimator. Specifically, assuming the Mean Squared Error decreases as a power law in the number of training samples, we derive a generalized concentration inequality and prove that ML-UCB achieves sublinear regret. This framework enables the principled integration of any ML model whose learning curve can be empirically characterized, eliminating the need for model-specific theoretical analysis. We validate our approach through experiments on a collaborative filtering recommendation system using online matrix factorization with synthetic data designed to simulate a simplified two-tower model, demonstrating substantial improvements over LinUCB</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Myung-Hwan Jang, Jeong-Min Park, Yunyong Ko, Sang-Wook Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved breakthroughs in various real-world downstream tasks due to their powerful expressiveness. As the scale of real-world graphs has been continuously growing, a storage-based approach to GNN training has been studied, which leverages external storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to handle such web-scale graphs on a single machine. Although such storage-based GNN training methods have shown promising potential in large-scale GNN training, we observed that they suffer from a severe bottleneck in data preparation since they overlook a critical challenge: how to handle a large number of small storage I/Os. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based GNN training framework, named AGNES, that employs a method of block-wise storage I/O processing to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth of high-performance storage devices. Moreover, to further enhance the efficiency of each storage I/O, AGNES employs a simple yet effective strategy, hyperbatch-based processing based on the characteristics of real-world graphs. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world graphs reveal that AGNES consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods, by up to 4.1X faster than the best competitor.

<p>Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashid Iqbal (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences), Saddam Hussain Khan (Artificial Intelligence Lab, Department of Computer Systems Engineering, University of Engineering,Applied Sciences)</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, a deep learning approach for Mpox diagnosis named Customized Residual SwinTransformerV2 (RSwinV2) has been proposed, trying to enhance the capability of lesion classification by employing the RSwinV2 tool-assisted vision approach. In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.51 and an F1score of 96.13 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; the RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its validity as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawen Zhang, Lipeng He, Kejia Chen, Jian Lou, Jian Liu, Xiaohu Yang, Ruoxi Jia</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) can substantially compromise their safety. Previous approaches require many safety samples or calibration sets, which not only incur significant computational overhead during realignment but also lead to noticeable degradation in model utility. Contrary to this belief, we show that safety alignment can be fully recovered with only a single safety example, without sacrificing utility and at minimal cost. Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs. Furthermore, we uncover the low-rank structure of the safety gradient, which explains why such efficient correction is possible. We validate our findings across five safety-aligned LLMs and multiple datasets, demonstrating the generality of our approach.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01896">Tackling the Inherent Difficulty of Noise Filtering in RAG</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyu Liu, Jiaen Lin, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted approach to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge and reducing hallucinations. However, noisy or irrelevant documents are often introduced during RAG, potentially degrading performance and even causing hallucinated outputs. While various methods have been proposed to filter out such noise, we argue that identifying irrelevant information from retrieved content is inherently difficult and limited number of transformer layers can hardly solve this. Consequently, retrievers fail to filter out irrelevant documents entirely. Therefore, LLMs must be robust against such noise, but we demonstrate that standard fine-tuning approaches are often ineffective in enabling the model to selectively utilize relevant information while ignoring irrelevant content due to the structural constraints of attention patterns. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning method designed to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information within retrieved documents. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves the robustness and performance of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tobias Schimanski, Imene Kolli, Yu Fan, Ario Saeid Vaghefi, Jingwei Ni, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold</p>
<p>Abstract: PDFs are the second-most used document type on the internet (after HTML). Yet, existing QA datasets commonly start from text sources or only address specific domains. In this paper, we present pdfQA, a multi-domain 2K human-annotated (real-pdfQA) and 2K synthetic dataset (syn-pdfQA) differentiating QA pairs in ten complexity dimensions (e.g., file type, source modality, source position, answer type). We apply and evaluate quality and difficulty filters on both datasets, obtaining valid and challenging QA pairs. We answer the questions with open-source LLMs, revealing existing challenges that correlate with our complexity dimensions. pdfQA presents a basis for end-to-end QA pipeline evaluation, testing diverse skill sets and local optimizations (e.g., in information retrieval or parsing).</p>
