<p><b>Authors:</b> Longjie Zhao, Ziming Hong, Jiaxin Huang, Runnan Chen, Mingming Gong, Tongliang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a mainstream representation for real-time 3D scene synthesis, enabling applications in virtual and augmented reality, robotics, and 3D content creation. Its rising commercial value and explicit parametric structure raise emerging intellectual property (IP) protection concerns, prompting a surge of research on 3DGS IP protection. However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Bayeh, Samira Sadaoui, Malek Mouhoub</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, we propose TruKAN, a new architecture based on the KAN structure and learnable activation functions. TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxx Richard Rahman, Mostafa Hammouda, Wolfgang Maass</p>
<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haijiang Yan, Nick Chater, Adam Sanborn</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating individual-level cognitive priors offers an important route to personalizing neural networks, yet accurately eliciting such priors remains challenging: existing methods either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases. Here, we introduce PriorProbe, a novel elicitation approach grounded in Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People that recovers fine-grained, individual-specific priors. Focusing on a facial expression recognition task, we apply PriorProbe to individual participants and test whether integrating the recovered priors with a state-of-the-art neural network improves its ability to predict an individual's classification on ambiguous stimuli. The PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels. Together, these results demonstrate that PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshansh Mishra, Rakesh Morisetty</p>
<p>Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xindan Zhang, Weilong Yan, Yufei Shi, Xuerui Qiu, Tao He, Ying Li, Ming Li, Hehe Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Point clouds provide a compact and expressive representation of 3D objects, and have recently been integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DPC$^2$hat significantly improves action understanding and temporal reasoning compared with existing models, establishing a strong foundation for 4D dynamic point cloud understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxing Zhou, Yanghao Zhou, Yaoting Wang, Zongyan Han, Jiaqi Ma, Henghui Ding, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement. Data and codes will be released at https://github.com/jasongief/MQA-RefAVS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibing Wang, Shuang Li, Tingting Huang, Yu Zhang, Chulhong Kim, Seongwook Choi, Changhui Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Although the iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm can substantially correct reconstruction artifacts in photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT), it suffers from long reconstruction times, especially for large-scale three-dimensional (3D) imaging in which IR takes hundreds of seconds to hours. The computing burden severely limits the practical applicability of IR algorithms. In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments. This revolutionary ultrafast image reconstruction enables near-real-time large-scale 3D PA reconstruction, significantly advancing 3D PACT toward clinical applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Markoff, Stefan Hein Bengtson, Michael {\O}rsted</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuwei Tan, Ziyu Hu, Xueru Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data often inherit and amplify biases against certain social groups, raising urgent concerns about their deployment at scale. While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices. NH-Fair provides a reproducible, tuning-aware pipeline for rigorous, harm-aware fairness evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuming Luo, Tao Zeng, Feng Li, Heming Liu, Rui Mao, Chang Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Levi Lingsch, Georgios Kissas, Johannes Jakubik, Siddhartha Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03918">Entropy Reveals Block Importance in Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformers</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Peihao Xiang, Kaida Wu, Ou Bai</p>
<p>Abstract: Masked self-supervised vision transformers have become a dominant pretraining paradigm, yet their substantial model size poses significant challenges for resource-constrained deployment and efficient transfer learning. A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leeje Jang, Yijun Lin, Yao-Yi Chiang, Jerod Weinman</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize text in real-world images, where instances are often short, fragmented, or visually ambiguous. Existing methods primarily rely on visual cues and implicitly capture local character dependencies, but they overlook the benefits of external linguistic knowledge. Prior attempts to integrate language models either adapt language modeling objectives without external knowledge or apply pretrained models that are misaligned with the word-level granularity of scene text. We propose TiCLS, an end-to-end text spotter that explicitly incorporates external linguistic knowledge from a character-level pretrained language model. TiCLS introduces a linguistic decoder that fuses visual and linguistic features, yet can be initialized by a pretrained language model, enabling robust recognition of ambiguous or fragmented text. Experiments on ICDAR 2015 and Total-Text demonstrate that TiCLS achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of PLM-guided linguistic integration for scene text spotting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joanna Kaleta, Bartosz \'Swirta, Kacper Kania, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek, Marek Kowalski</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing demand for rapid and scalable 3D asset creation has driven interest in feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods, with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerging as an effective scene representation. While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach. Repository: https://github.com/joaxkal/AnyStyle.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Panagiotis Mousouliotis, Georgios Keramidas</p>
<p>Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shikha Dubey, Patricia Raciti, Kristopher Standish, Albert Juan Ramon, Erik Ames Burlingame</p>
<p>Abstract: High-fidelity registration of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs), such as hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), is vital for integrated molecular analysis but challenging to evaluate without ground-truth (GT) annotations. Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations. In the absence of GT, this framework offers reliable, real-time RQA with high fidelity and minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale quality control in digital pathology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juntao Zhang, Angona Biswas, Jaydeep Rade, Charchit Shukla, Juan Ren, Anwesha Sarkar, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Aditya Balu</p>
<p>Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables high-resolution surface imaging at the nanoscale, yet the output is often degraded by artifacts introduced by environmental noise, scanning imperfections, and tip-sample interactions. To address this challenge, a lightweight and fully automated framework for artifact detection and restoration in AFM image analysis is presented. The pipeline begins with a classification model that determines whether an AFM image contains artifacts. If necessary, a lightweight semantic segmentation network, custom-designed and trained on AFM data, is applied to generate precise artifact masks. These masks are adaptively expanded based on their structural orientation and then inpainted using a directional neighbor-based interpolation strategy to preserve 3D surface continuity. A localized Gaussian smoothing operation is then applied for seamless restoration. The system is integrated into a user-friendly GUI that supports real-time parameter adjustments and batch processing. Experimental results demonstrate the effective artifact removal while preserving nanoscale structural details, providing a robust, geometry-aware solution for high-fidelity AFM data interpretation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rio Aguina-Kang, Kevin James Blackburn-Matzen, Thibault Groueix, Vladimir Kim, Matheus Gadelha</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SeeingThroughClutter, a method for reconstructing structured 3D representations from single images by segmenting and modeling objects individually. Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

Zhang, Emma Lundberg, Dokyoon Kim, Serena Yeung-Levy, James Zou, Thomas Montine, Jeffrey Nirschl, Zhi Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides information on protein expression in tissue sections and is commonly used to support pathology diagnosis and disease triage. While AI models for H\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\% accuracy for location, 76.6\% for intensity, and 75.7\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\% vs 68\% for location, 70\% vs 57\% for intensity, 68\% vs 52\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $\kappa$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation. This work establishes a foundation for AI systems that can improve IHC diagnostic accuracy and highlights the potential for integrating iSight into clinical workflows to enhance the consistency and reliability of IHC assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junbo Zou, Ziheng Huang, Shengjie Zhang, Liwen Zhang, Weining Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the inherent tension between computational constraints and the need to capture information distributed across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample frames uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in a single pass (with no recovery from poor choices). We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial. Experiments on four long video benchmarks demonstrate that VideoBrain achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over the baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames, with strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aayushma Pant, Lakpa Tamang, Tsz-Kwan Lee, Sunil Aryal</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify rare and irregular targets in high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are often noisy and unlabelled data. Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we focus on boosting the feature extraction to improve the performance of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) in endoscopy videos. We present SuperPoint-E, a new local feature extraction method that, using our proposed Tracking Adaptation supervision strategy, significantly improves the quality of feature detection and description in endoscopy. Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision). In addition, our descriptor is more discriminative, making the guided matching step almost redundant. The presented approach brings significant improvements in the 3D reconstructions obtained, via SfM on endoscopy videos, compared to the original SuperPoint and the gold standard SfM COLMAP pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiroshi Sasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) are expected to analyse complex documents, such as those containing flowcharts, through a question-answering (QA) interface. The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks.

<p>Abstract: Segmentation architectures are typically benchmarked on single imaging modalities, obscuring deployment-relevant performance variations: an architecture optimal for one modality may underperform on another. We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04162">Improving 2D Diffusion Models for 3D Medical Imaging with Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhe Du, Qing Wu, Xuanyu Tian, Jingyi Yu, Hongjiang Wei, Yuyao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhou, Xiaoyan Yang, Bojia Zi, Lihan Zhang, Ruijie Sun, Weishi Zheng, Haibin Huang, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Point2Insert, a sparse-point-based framework for flexible and user-friendly object insertion in videos, motivated by the growing popularity of accurate, low-effort object placement. Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\times$10 more parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Kuan Hsieh, Jun-Wei Hsieh, Xin li, Ming-Ching Chang, Yu-Chee Tseng</p>
<p>Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to attention for vision tasks, offering lineartime sequence processing with competitive accuracy. Vision SSMs, however, require serializing 2D images into 1D token sequences along a predefined scan order, a factor often overlooked. We show that scan order critically affects performance by altering spatial adjacency, fracturing object continuity, and amplifying degradation under geometric transformations such as rotation. We present Partial RIng Scan Mamba (PRISMamba), a rotation-robust traversal that partitions an image into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, and propagates context across rings through a set of short radial SSMs. Efficiency is further improved via partial channel filtering, which routes only the most informative channels through the recurrent ring pathway while keeping the rest on a lightweight residual branch. On ImageNet-1K, PRISMamba achieves 84.5% Top-1 with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s on A100, outperforming VMamba in both accuracy and throughput while requiring fewer FLOPs. It also maintains performance under rotation, whereas fixed-path scans drop by 1~2%. These results highlight scan-order design, together with channel filtering, as a crucial, underexplored factor for accuracy, efficiency, and rotation robustness in Vision SSMs. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weidong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angel Martinez-Sanchez, Parthib Roy, Ross Greer</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning</p>

<p>Abstract: Prior masked modeling motion generation methods predominantly study text-to-motion. We present DiMo, a discrete diffusion-style framework, which extends masked modeling to bidirectional text--motion understanding and generation. Unlike GPT-style autoregressive approaches that tokenize motion and decode sequentially, DiMo performs iterative masked token refinement, unifying Text-to-Motion (T2M), Motion-to-Text (M2T), and text-free Motion-to-Motion (M2M) within a single model. This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework. In addition, we demonstrate model ability in text-free motion completion, text-guided motion prediction and motion caption correction without architectural change.Additional qualitative results are available on our project page: https://animotionlab.github.io/DiMo/.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonjae Kim, Dongjin Kim, Eugene Jin, Tae Hyun Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: While deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have shown impressive outcomes with synthetic degradation scenarios such as bicubic downsampling, they frequently struggle to perform well on real-world images that feature complex, nonlinear degradations like noise, blur, and compression artifacts. Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feng Wang, Yichun Shi, Ceyuan Yang, Qiushan Guo, Jingxiang Sun, Alan Yuille, Peng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This work presents VTok, a unified video tokenization framework that can be used for both generation and understanding tasks. Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Li, Rui Zhang, Siyuan Huang, Xian Zhong, Hongbo Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting requires capturing the multimodal nature of pedestrian behavior. However, existing approaches suffer from prior misalignment. Their learned or fixed priors often fail to capture the full distribution of plausible futures, limiting both prediction accuracy and diversity. We theoretically establish that prediction error is lower-bounded by prior quality, making prior modeling a key performance bottleneck. Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, Stanford Drone, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that AGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the critical role of high-quality priors in trajectory forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Teng, Minxuan Lin, Xian Liu, Shuai Wang, Xiao Yang, Xihui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanuman Verma, Kiho Im, Pranabesh Maji, Akshansh Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate segmentation of MRI brain images is essential for image analysis, diagnosis of neuro-logical disorders and medical image computing. In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suzeyu Chen, Leheng Li, Ying-Cong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.
  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya R. Bhattacharya, Debanjan Goswami, Shayok Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Li, Yuanzhi Wang, Yi Ding, Shiqing Zhang, Ke Lu, Cuntai Guan</p>
<p>Abstract: Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) seeks to infer human emotions by integrating information from language, visual, and acoustic modalities. Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\%/2.4\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\%/1.9\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\%/1.8\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively. Meanwhile, visualization results reveal that both the graph edges and dictionary activations in DHMD exhibit meaningful distribution patterns across modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04268">KVSmooth: Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Key-Value Smoothing</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyu Jiang, Feiyang Chen, Xiaojin Zhang, Kun He</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.
  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.
  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jue Gong, Zihan Zhou, Jingkai Wang, Xiaohong Liu, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Face fill-light enhancement (FFE) brightens underexposed faces by adding virtual fill light while keeping the original scene illumination and background unchanged. Most face relighting methods aim to reshape overall lighting, which can suppress the input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs. To support scalable learning, we introduce LightYourFace-160K (LYF-160K), a large-scale paired dataset built with a physically consistent renderer that injects a disk-shaped area fill light controlled by six disentangled factors, producing 160K before-and-after pairs. We first pretrain a physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) that embeds the 6D parameters into conditioning tokens, using an auxiliary planar-light reconstruction objective. Building on a pretrained diffusion backbone, we then train a fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff), an efficient one-step model conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes, enabling controllable and high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost. Experiments on held-out paired sets demonstrate strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics, while better preserving background illumination.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zipeng Zhu, Zhanghao Hu, Qinglin Zhu, Yuxi Hong, Yijun Liu, Jingyong Su, Yulan He, Lin Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable 3D human avatars from monocular RGB videos remains challenging, particularly in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios where camera parameters and human poses from off-the-shelf methods (e.g., COLMAP, HMR2.0) are often inaccurate. Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Chen, Zhu Wang, Chuanbin Liu, Xi Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Features of the same sample generated by different pretrained models often exhibit inherently distinct feature distributions because of discrepancies in the model pretraining objectives or architectures. Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Neural Memory Object (NeMO), a novel object-centric representation that can be used to detect, segment and estimate the 6DoF pose of objects unseen during training using RGB images. Our method consists of an encoder that requires only a few RGB template views depicting an object to generate a sparse object-like point cloud using a learned UDF containing semantic and geometric information. Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing. We report competitive and state-of-the-art results on various datasets and perception tasks of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating the versatility of our approach. https://github.com/DLR-RM/nemo</p>

<p>Abstract: 3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehyun Kwak, Nam Cao, Boryeong Cho, Segyu Lee, Sumyeong Ahn, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Li, Ning Wang, Tongxin Bai, Changwang Mei, Peisong Wang, Shuang Qiu, Jian Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weihao Gao, Zhuo Deng, Zheng Gong, Lan Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications. Source code is publicly available to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future benchmarking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixin Zhu, Long Lv, Pingping Zhang, Xuehu Liu, Tongdan Tang, Feng Tian, Weibing Sun, Huchuan Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to combine images from different modalities to produce fused images, retaining texture details and preserving significant information. Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jue Gong, Zihan Zhou, Jingkai Wang, Shu Li, Libo Liu, Jianliang Lan, Yulun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing methods for restoring degraded human-centric images often struggle with insufficient fidelity, particularly in human body restoration (HBR). Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingyu Miao, Weiguang Zhao, Tao Lu, Linning Yu, Mulin Yu, Yang Long, Jiangmiao Pang, Junting Dong</p>
<p>Abstract: Feed-forward multi-frame 3D reconstruction models often degrade on videos with object motion. Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision. Extensive experiments across 3D tracking, pose estimation, pointmap reconstruction, and video depth show that TrajVG surpasses the current feedforward performance baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Point tracking aims to follow visual points through complex motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes, and has advanced rapidly with modern foundation models. Yet progress toward general point tracking remains constrained by limited high-quality data, as existing datasets often provide insufficient diversity and imperfect trajectory annotations. To this end, we introduce SynthVerse, a large-scale, diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for point tracking. SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking. In addition, we establish a highly diverse point tracking benchmark to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art methods under broader domain shifts. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that training with SynthVerse yields consistent improvements in generalization and reveal limitations of existing trackers under diverse settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianming Liang, Qirui Du, Jian-Fang Hu, Haichao Jiang, Zicheng Lin, Wei-Shi Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Segmentation based on language has been a popular topic in computer vision. While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/Seg-ReSearch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothy Schauml\"offel, Arthur Aubret, Gemma Roig, Jochen Triesch</p>
<p>Abstract: Humans acquire semantic object representations from egocentric visual streams with minimal supervision. Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Li, Congyang Ou, Haokui Zhang, Guoting Wei, Shengqin Jiang, Ying Li, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, diffusion models bring novel insights for Pan-sharpening and notably boost fusion precision. However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byungwoo Jeon, Yoonwoo Jeong, Hyunseok Lee, Minsu Cho, Jinwoo Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent paradigm shift in 3D vision led to the rise of foundation models with remarkable capabilities in 3D perception from uncalibrated images. However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.</p>

OmniRad is evaluated on a broad suite of public benchmarks spanning classification and segmentation across multiple modalities. On the MedMNISTv2 collection, OmniRad improves classification F1 by up to 2.05% over competing foundation models. For dense prediction, OmniRad attains mean Dice score improvements across six MedSegBench datasets when using frozen representations.

<p>Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) revolutionized novel view rendering. Instead of inferring from dense spatial points, as implicit representations do, 3DGS uses sparse Gaussians. This enables real-time performance but increases space requirements, hindering applications such as immersive communication. 3DGS compression emerged as a field aimed at alleviating this issue. While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality at extremely low rates, down to 0.1 MB, and towards 1000x rate improvement over 3DGS at comparable perceptual performance. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanzhou Lan, Chenyi Liao, Yuqi Yang, Qianli Ma, Zhigang Wang, Dong Wang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding visual degradations is a critical yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriele Magrini, Federico Becattini, Niccol\`o Biondi, Pietro Pala</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahmoud Z. A. Wahba, Francesco Barbato, Sara Baldoni, Federica Battisti</p>
<p>Abstract: Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present ImmuVis, an efficient convolutional foundation model for imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a high-throughput multiplex imaging technology that handles molecular marker measurements as image channels and enables large-scale spatial tissue profiling. Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ra\'ul Jim\'enez Cruz, C\'esar Torres-Huitzil, Marco Franceschetti, Ronny Seiger, Luciano Garc\'ia-Ba\~nuelos, Barbara Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: This data article presents a dataset of 11,884 labeled images documenting a simulated blood extraction (phlebotomy) procedure performed on a training arm. Images were extracted from high-definition videos recorded under controlled conditions and curated to reduce redundancy using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) filtering. An automated face-anonymization step was applied to all videos prior to frame selection. Each image contains polygon annotations for five medically relevant classes: syringe, rubber band, disinfectant wipe, gloves, and training arm. The annotations were exported in a segmentation format compatible with modern object detection frameworks (e.g., YOLOv8), ensuring broad usability. This dataset is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) subsets and is designed to advance research in medical training automation and human-object interaction. It enables multiple applications, including phlebotomy tool detection, procedural step recognition, workflow analysis, conformance checking, and the development of educational systems that provide structured feedback to medical trainees. The data and accompanying label files are publicly available on Zenodo.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04657">PIO-FVLM: Rethinking Training-Free Visual Token Reduction for VLM Acceleration from an Inference-Objective Perspective</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Haokui Zhang, Congyang Ou, Dawei Yan, Peng Wang, Qingsen Yan, Ying Li, Rong Xiao, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, reducing redundant visual tokens in vision-language models (VLMs) to accelerate VLM inference has emerged as a hot topic. However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jin-Chuan Shi, Binhong Ye, Tao Liu, Junzhe He, Yangjinhui Xu, Xiaoyang Liu, Zeju Li, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijia Chen, Lijuan Ma, Yanqiu Yu, En Yu, Liman Liu, Wenbing Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samet Hicsonmez, Jose Sosa, Dan Pineau, Inder Pal Singh, Arunkumar Rathinam, Abd El Rahman Shabayek, Djamila Aouada</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David F. Ramirez, Tim Overman, Kristen Jaskie, Joe Marvin, Andreas Spanias</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gon\c{c}alo P. Matos, Carlos Santiago, Jo\~ao P. Costeira, Ricardo L. Saldanha, Ernesto M. Morgado</p>
<p>Abstract: Following crop growth through the vegetative cycle allows farmers to predict fruit setting and yield in early stages, but it is a laborious and non-scalable task if performed by a human who has to manually measure fruit sizes with a caliper or dendrometers. In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Buddhi Wijenayake, Nichula Wasalathilake, Roshan Godaliyadda, Vijitha Herath, Parakrama Ekanayake, Vishal M. Patel</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04789">Light Forcing: Accelerating Autoregressive Video Diffusion via Sparse Attention</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengtao Lv, Yumeng Shi, Yushi Huang, Ruihao Gong, Shen Ren, Wenya Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU.

<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronghuan Wu, Wanchao Su, Kede Ma, Jing Liao, Rafa{\l} K. Mantiuk</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumya Jahagirdar, Walid Bousselham, Anna Kukleva, Hilde Kuehne</p>
<p>Abstract: Current autoregressive Vision Language Models (VLMs) usually rely on a large number of visual tokens to represent images, resulting in a need for more compute especially at inference time. To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ram\'on Calvo-Gonz\'alez, Fran\c{c}ois Fleuret</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has shown that diffusion models can generate high-quality images by operating directly on SSL patch features rather than pixel-space latents. However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features. These are preliminary results and this work is in progress.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Zhan, Zizhang Li, Hong-Xing Yu, Jiajun Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative simulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. Current works fail at this task because their physical state is decoupled from their visual representation, which prevents generative refinements to update the underlying physics for subsequent interactions. PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihang Lai, Eldar Insafutdinov, Edgar Sucar, Andrea Vedaldi</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.</p>

We formulate this as a supervised image-conditioned program synthesis task, where the model learns to correct HTML given the HTML and its rendering.

We then propose a violation-conditioned VLM that additionally conditions on the WCAG2 violation count to guide the correction process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayu Huo, Jingyuan Hong, Liyun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in medical images aims to identify abnormal regions without relying on pixel-level annotations, which is crucial for scalable and label-efficient diagnostic systems. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework based on DINO-V3 representations, termed DINO-AD, which leverages self-supervised visual features for precise and interpretable anomaly localization. Specifically, we introduce an embedding similarity matching strategy to select a semantically aligned support image and a foreground-aware K-means clustering module to model the distribution of normal features. Anomaly maps are then computed by comparing the query features with clustered normal embeddings through cosine similarity. Experimental results on both the Brain and Liver datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior quantitative performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches, achieving AUROC scores of up to 98.71. Qualitative results further confirm that our framework produces clearer and more accurate anomaly localization. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have rapidly advanced and are becoming a common backbone for downstream clinical tasks, offering strong transferability across tissues and institutions. However, for dense prediction (e.g., segmentation), practical deployment still lacks a clear, reproducible understanding of how different PFMs behave across datasets and how adaptation choices affect performance and stability. We present PFM-DenseBench, a large-scale benchmark for dense pathology prediction, evaluating 17 PFMs across 18 public segmentation datasets. Under a unified protocol, we systematically assess PFMs with multiple adaptation and fine-tuning strategies, and derive insightful, practice-oriented findings on when and why different PFMs and tuning choices succeed or fail across heterogeneous datasets. We release containers, configs, and dataset cards to enable reproducible evaluation and informed PFM selection for real-world dense pathology tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seohyun Joo, Yoori Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual video highlight detection aims to automatically identify the most salient moments in videos by leveraging both visual and auditory cues. However, existing models often underutilize the audio modality, focusing on high-level semantic features while failing to fully leverage the rich, dynamic characteristics of sound. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Video Highlight Detection (DAViHD). The dual-pathway audio encoder is composed of a semantic pathway for content understanding and a dynamic pathway that captures spectro-temporal dynamics. The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes. We integrate the novel audio encoder into a full audio-visual framework and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Mr.HiSum benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a sophisticated, dual-faceted audio representation is key to advancing the field of highlight detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate vehicle localization is a critical challenge in urban environments where GPS signals are often unreliable. This paper presents a cooperative multi-sensor and multi-modal localization approach to address this issue by fusing data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems. Our approach integrates cooperative data with a point cloud registration-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The system processes point clouds generated from diverse sensor modalities, including vehicle-mounted LiDAR and stereo cameras, as well as sensors deployed at intersections. By leveraging shared data from infrastructure, our method significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness in complex, GPS-noisy urban scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Zia, Farid Hazratian</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Liu, Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh, Yiqing Xu, Jiafei Duan, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Why do pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policies fail when the same task is performed near an obstacle, on a shifted support surface, or amid mild clutter? Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Qiu, Tinglin Huang, Aosong Feng, Rex Ying</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for generalist robotic control. Built upon vision-language model (VLM) architectures, VLAs predict actions conditioned on visual observations and language instructions, achieving strong performance and generalization across tasks. However, VLAs face two major challenges: limited long-horizon context and inefficient inference due to the quadratic attention complexity and large parameter counts. Our work is motivated by the observation that much of the visual information in a trajectory remains static across timesteps (e.g., the background). Leveraging this property, we propose SD-VLA, a framework that disentangles visual inputs into multi-level static and dynamic tokens, which enables (1) retaining a single copy of static tokens across frames to significantly reduce context length, and (2) reusing the key-value (KV) cache of static tokens through a lightweight recache gate that updates only when necessary. This design enables efficient multi-frame integration and efficient inference. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark that more effectively evaluates the long-horizon temporal dependency modeling ability of VLAs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines on this benchmark by 39.8% absolute improvement in success rate, and achieves a 3.9% gain on the SimplerEnv benchmark. Moreover, SD-VLA delivers a 2.26x inference speedup over the base VLA model on the same benchmark, enabling faster and more practical real-world deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) preprocessing, typically comprising tissue detection followed by patch extraction, is foundational to AI-driven computational pathology workflows. This remains a major computational bottleneck as existing tools either rely on inaccurate heuristic thresholding for tissue detection, or adopt AI-based approaches trained on limited-diversity data that operate at the patch level, incurring substantial computational complexity. We present AtlasPatch, an efficient and scalable slide preprocessing framework for accurate tissue detection and high-throughput patch extraction with minimal computational overhead. AtlasPatch's tissue detection module is trained on a heterogeneous and semi-manually annotated dataset of ~30,000 WSI thumbnails, using efficient fine-tuning of the Segment-Anything model. The tool extrapolates tissue masks from thumbnails to full-resolution slides to extract patch coordinates at user-specified magnifications, with options to stream patches directly into common image encoders for embedding or store patch images, all efficiently parallelized across CPUs and GPUs. We assess AtlasPatch across segmentation precision, computational complexity, and downstream multiple-instance learning, matching state-of-the-art performance while operating at a fraction of their computational cost.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Lotfian, Mohammad Jalali, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-guided generative AI models have rapidly expanded across vision and language domains, producing realistic and diverse outputs from textual inputs. The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present the Multi-Scale Spatial Channel Attention Network (MS-SCANet), a transformer-based architecture designed for no-reference image quality assessment (IQA). MS-SCANet features a dual-branch structure that processes images at multiple scales, effectively capturing both fine and coarse details, an improvement over traditional single-scale methods. By integrating tailored spatial and channel attention mechanisms, our model emphasizes essential features while minimizing computational complexity. A key component of MS-SCANet is its cross-branch attention mechanism, which enhances the integration of features across different scales, addressing limitations in previous approaches. We also introduce two new consistency loss functions, Cross-Branch Consistency Loss and Adaptive Pooling Consistency Loss, which maintain spatial integrity during feature scaling, outperforming conventional linear and bilinear techniques. Extensive evaluations on datasets like KonIQ-10k, LIVE, LIVE Challenge, and CSIQ show that MS-SCANet consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust framework with stronger correlations with subjective human scores.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding how neural representations respond to geometric transformations is essential for evaluating whether learned features preserve meaningful spatial structure. Existing approaches primarily assess robustness by comparing model outputs under transformed inputs, offering limited insight into how geometric information is organized within internal representations and failing to distinguish between information loss and re-encoding. In this work, we introduce SEIS (Subspace-based Equivariance and Invariance Scores), a subspace metric for analyzing layer-wise feature representations under geometric transformations, disentangling equivariance from invariance without requiring labels or explicit knowledge of the transformation. Synthetic validation confirms that SEIS correctly recovers known transformations. Applied to trained classification networks, SEIS reveals a transition from equivariance in early layers to invariance in deeper layers, and that data augmentation increases invariance while preserving equivariance. We further show that multi-task learning induces synergistic gains in both properties at the shared encoder, and skip connections restore equivariance lost during decoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to perform the boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (BDCA) on non-smooth and non-convex problems involving the difference of convex (DC) functions. The recently proposed BDCA uses an extrapolation step from the point computed by the classical DC algorithm (DCA) via a line search procedure in a descent direction to get an additional decrease of the objective function and accelerate the convergence of DCA. However, when the first function in DC decomposition is non-smooth, the direction computed by BDCA can be ascent and a monotone line search cannot be performed. In this work, we proposed a monotone improved boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (IBDCA) for certain types of non-smooth DC programs, namely those that can be formulated as the difference of a possibly non-smooth function and a smooth one. We show that any cluster point of the sequence generated by IBDCA is a critical point of the problem under consideration and that the corresponding objective value is monotonically decreasing and convergent. We also present the global convergence and the convergent rate under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. The applications of IBDCA in image recovery show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The corresponding numerical experiments demonstrate that our IBDCA outperforms DCA and other state-of-the-art DC methods in both computational time and number of iterations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhyey Manish Rajani, Michael Milford, Tobias Fischer</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a key component for localisation in GNSS-denied environments, but its performance critically depends on selecting an image matching threshold (operating point) that balances precision and recall. Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

This paper introduces self-evolving embodied AI, a new paradigm in which agents operate based on their changing state and environment with memory self-updating, task self-switching, environment self-prediction, embodiment self-adaptation, and model self-evolution, aiming to achieve continually adaptive intelligence with autonomous evolution. Specifically, we present the definition, framework, components, and mechanisms of self-evolving embodied AI, systematically review state-of-the-art works for realized components, discuss practical applications, and point out future research directions. We believe that self-evolving embodied AI enables agents to autonomously learn and interact with environments in a human-like manner and provide a new perspective toward general artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Bai, MingMing Yu, Chaojie Li, Ziyi Bai, Xinlong Wang, B\"orje F. Karlsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots in real-world settings is fundamentally challenging, as it demands tight integration of perception, locomotion, and manipulation under partial-information observations and dynamically changing environments. As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ondrej Tybl, Lukas Neumann</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student by aligning their predictive distributions. However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yang Yian, Yu Fan, Liudmila Zavolokina, Sarah Ebling</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have made remarkable progress in producing high-quality visual content from textual descriptions, yet concerns remain about how they represent social groups. While characteristics like gender and race have received increasing attention, disability representations remain underexplored. This study investigates how people with disabilities are represented in AI-generated images by analyzing outputs from Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 using a structured prompt design. We analyze disability representations by comparing image similarities between generic disability prompts and prompts referring to specific disability categories. Moreover, we evaluate how mitigation strategies influence disability portrayals, with a focus on assessing affective framing through sentiment polarity analysis, combining both automatic and human evaluation. Our findings reveal persistent representational imbalances and highlight the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of generative models to foster more diverse and inclusive portrayals of disability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wen, Lena Hegemann, Xiaofu Jin, Shuai Ma, Antti Oulasvirta</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning text-to-image generation with user intent remains challenging, for users who provide ambiguous inputs and struggle with model idiosyncrasies. We propose Adaptive Prompt Elicitation (APE), a technique that adaptively asks visual queries to help users refine prompts without extensive writing. Our technical contribution is a formulation of interactive intent inference under an information-theoretic framework. APE represents latent intent as interpretable feature requirements using language model priors, adaptively generates visual queries, and compiles elicited requirements into effective prompts. Evaluation on IDEA-Bench and DesignBench shows that APE achieves stronger alignment with improved efficiency. A user study with challenging user-defined tasks demonstrates 19.8% higher alignment without workload overhead. Our work contributes a principled approach to prompting that, for general users, offers an effective and efficient complement to the prevailing prompt-based interaction paradigm with text-to-image models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyang Deng, He Li, Tianhong Li, Yilun Du, Kaiming He</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative modeling can be formulated as learning a mapping f such that its pushforward distribution matches the data distribution. The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space. We hope that our work opens up new opportunities for high-quality one-step generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hannah Pinson</p>
<p>Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi Gu, Yukang Gao, Yangchen Zhou, Xingyu Chen, Yixiao Feng, Mingle Zhao, Yunyang Mo, Zhaorui Wang, Lixin Xu, Renjing Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance.
  We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Viraj Shah, Nataniel Ruiz, Forrester Cole, Erika Lu, Svetlana Lazebnik, Yuanzhen Li, Varun Jampani</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods for finetuning generative models for concept-driven personalization generally achieve strong results for subject-driven or style-driven generation. Recently, low-rank adaptations (LoRA) have been proposed as a parameter-efficient way of achieving concept-driven personalization. While recent work explores the combination of separate LoRAs to achieve joint generation of learned styles and subjects, existing techniques do not reliably address the problem; they often compromise either subject fidelity or style fidelity. We propose ZipLoRA, a method to cheaply and effectively merge independently trained style and subject LoRAs in order to achieve generation of any user-provided subject in any user-provided style. Experiments on a wide range of subject and style combinations show that ZipLoRA can generate compelling results with meaningful improvements over baselines in subject and style fidelity while preserving the ability to recontextualize.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dominik R\"o{\ss}le, Jeremias Gerner, Klaus Bogenberger, Daniel Cremers, Stefanie Schmidtner, Torsten Sch\"on</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate and comprehensive semantic segmentation of Bird's Eye View (BEV) is essential for ensuring safe and proactive navigation in autonomous driving. Although cooperative perception has exceeded the detection capabilities of single-agent systems, prevalent camera-based algorithms in cooperative perception neglect valuable information derived from historical observations. This limitation becomes critical during sensor failures or communication issues as cooperative perception reverts to single-agent perception, leading to degraded performance and incomplete BEV segmentation maps. This paper introduces TempCoBEV, a temporal module designed to incorporate historical cues into current observations, thereby improving the quality and reliability of BEV map segmentations. We propose an importance-guided attention architecture to effectively integrate temporal information that prioritizes relevant properties for BEV map segmentation. TempCoBEV is an independent temporal module that seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art camera-based cooperative perception models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset that TempCoBEV performs better than non-temporal models in predicting current and future BEV map segmentations, particularly in scenarios involving communication failures. We show the efficacy of TempCoBEV and its capability to integrate historical cues into the current BEV map, improving predictions under optimal communication conditions by up to 2% and under communication failures by up to 19%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhijie Shen, Chunyu Lin, Lang Nie, Kang Liao, Weisi Lin, Yao Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Depth estimation from a monocular 360 image is important to the perception of the entire 3D environment. However, the inherent distortion and large field of view (FoV) in 360 images pose great challenges for this task. To this end, existing mainstream solutions typically introduce additional perspective-based 360 representations ({e.g., Cubemap) to achieve effective feature extraction. Nevertheless, regardless of the introduced representations, they eventually need to be unified into the equirectangular projection (ERP) format for the subsequent depth estimation, which inevitably reintroduces the troublesome distortions. In this work, we propose an oriented distortion-aware Gabor Fusion framework (PGFuse) to address the above challenges. First, we introduce Gabor filters that analyze texture in the frequency domain, thereby extending the receptive fields and enhancing depth cues. To address the reintroduced distortions, we design a linear latitude-aware distortion representation method to generate customized, distortion-aware Gabor filters (PanoGabor filters). Furthermore, we design a channel-wise and spatial-wise unidirectional fusion module (CS-UFM) that integrates the proposed PanoGabor filters to unify other representations into the ERP format, delivering effective and distortion-free features. Considering the orientation sensitivity of the Gabor transform, we introduce a spherical gradient constraint to stabilize this sensitivity. Experimental results on three popular indoor 360 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PGFuse to existing state-of-the-art solutions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiayi Kong, Chen Zong, Jun Luo, Shiqing Xin, Fei Hou, Hanqing Jiang, Chen Qian, Ying He</p>
<p>Abstract: The medial axis, a lower-dimensional descriptor that captures the extrinsic structure of a shape, plays an important role in digital geometry processing. Despite its importance, computing the medial axis transform robustly from diverse inputs, especially point clouds with defects, remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new implicit method that deviates from traditional explicit medial axis computation. Our key technical insight is that the difference between the signed distance field (SDF) and the medial field (MF) of a solid shape relates to the unsigned distance field (UDF) of the shape's medial axis. This observation allows us to formulate medial axis extraction as an implicit reconstruction problem. By employing a modified double covering strategy, we recover the medial axis as the zero level-set of the UDF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in learning compact medial axis transforms from challenging meshes and point clouds, outperforming existing approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current image immunization defense techniques against diffusion-based editing embed imperceptible noise into target images to disrupt editing models. However, these methods face scalability challenges, as they require time-consuming optimization for each image separately, taking hours for small batches. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffVax, a scalable, lightweight, and optimization-free framework for image immunization, specifically designed to prevent diffusion-based editing. Our approach enables effective generalization to unseen content, reducing computational costs and cutting immunization time from days to milliseconds, achieving a speedup of 250,000x. This is achieved through a loss term that ensures the failure of editing attempts and the imperceptibility of the perturbations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our model is scalable, optimization-free, adaptable to various diffusion-based editing tools, robust against counter-attacks, and, for the first time, effectively protects video content from editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sora Kim, Sungho Suh, Minsik Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, with applications broadening across various domains. Inpainting is one such application that can benefit significantly from diffusion models. Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well. Experiments demonstrated that RAD provides state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the FFHQ, LSUN Bedroom, and ImageNet datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Song, Xiangfei Yang, Shangke Lyu, Donglin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in real-time multi-sensor perception tasks due to their event-driven and parameter-efficient characteristics. A key challenge is the timestep-wise iterative update of neuronal hidden states (membrane potentials), which complicates the trade-off between accuracy and latency. SNNs tend to achieve better performance with longer timesteps, inevitably resulting in higher computational overhead and latency compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). Moreover, many recent advances in SNNs rely on architecture-specific optimizations, which, while effective with fewer timesteps, often limit generalizability and scalability across modalities and models. To address these limitations, we propose Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2), a unified hidden state update mechanism for SNNs. Inspired by the spatial propagation of membrane potentials in biological neurons, AMP2 enables dynamic transmission of membrane potentials among spatially adjacent neurons, facilitating spatiotemporal integration and cooperative dynamics of hidden states, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy while reducing reliance on extended temporal updates. This simple yet effective strategy significantly enhances SNN performance across various architectures, including MLPs and CNNs for point cloud and event-based data. Furthermore, ablation studies integrating AMP2 into Transformer-based SNNs for classification tasks demonstrate its potential as a general-purpose and efficient solution for spiking neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models for super-resolution (SR) produce high-quality visual results but require expensive computational costs. Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift. Our method is based on training the student network to produce images such that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a noticeable margin in various perceptual metrics (LPIPS, CLIPIQA, MUSIQ). We show that our distillation method can surpass SinSR, the other distillation-based method for ResShift, making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion SR distillation methods with limited computational costs in terms of perceptual quality. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality and requires fewer parameters, GPU memory, and training cost. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Ai, Kunyi Wang, Zezhou Wang, Hao Lu, Jin Tian, Yaxin Luo, Peng Xing, Jen-Yuan Huang, Huaxia Li, Gen luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various vision-language (VL) tasks, but their expensive computations still limit the real-world application. To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR. The source code will be released at https://github.com/aihao2000/DPN-LLaVA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zehui Liao, Shishuai Hu, Ke Zou, Mengyuan Jin, Yanning Zhang, Huazhu Fu, Liangli Zhen, Yong Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have great potential for medical image understanding, particularly in Visual Report Generation (VRG) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), but they may generate hallucinated responses that contradict visual evidence, limiting clinical deployment. Although uncertainty-based hallucination detection methods are intuitive and effective, they are limited in medical VLMs. Specifically, Semantic Entropy (SE), effective in text-only LLMs, becomes less reliable in medical VLMs due to their overconfidence from strong language priors. To address this challenge, we propose UniVRSE, a Unified Vision-conditioned Response Semantic Entropy framework for hallucination detection in medical VLMs. UniVRSE strengthens visual guidance during uncertainty estimation by contrasting the semantic predictive distributions derived from an original image-text pair and a visually distorted counterpart, with higher entropy indicating hallucination risk. For VQA, UniVRSE works on the image-question pair, while for VRG, it decomposes the report into claims, generates verification questions, and applies vision-conditioned entropy estimation at the claim level. To evaluate hallucination detection, we propose a unified pipeline that generates responses on medical datasets and derives hallucination labels via factual consistency assessment. However, current evaluation methods rely on subjective criteria or modality-specific rules. To improve reliability, we introduce Alignment Ratio of Atomic Facts (ALFA), a novel method that quantifies fine-grained factual consistency. ALFA-derived labels provide ground truth for robust benchmarking. Experiments on six medical VQA/VRG datasets and three VLMs show UniVRSE significantly outperforms existing methods with strong cross-modal generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangwen Zhang, Qian Zhang, Longfei Han, Qiang Qu, Xiaoming Chen, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Collecting real-world vehicle accident videos for autonomous driving research is challenging due to their rarity and complexity. While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Fang, Priyadarshini Panda</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic event cameras possess superior temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing methods either convert the events into dense synchronous frame representations for processing by powerful CNNs or Transformers, but lose the asynchronous, sparse and high temporal resolution characteristics of events during the conversion process; or adopt irregular models such as sparse convolution, spiking neural networks, or graph neural networks to process the irregular event representations but fail to take full advantage of GPU acceleration.Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing capabilities of Transformers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks, showing that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, features high throughput and low latency, and achieves high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events or low spatial resolutions. Event2vec introduces a novel paradigm by demonstrating for the first time that sparse, irregular event data can be directly integrated into high-throughput Transformer architectures. This breakthrough resolves the long-standing conflict between maintaining data sparsity and maximizing GPU efficiency, offering a promising balance for real-time, low-latency neuromorphic vision tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Wilhelm, Nils Napp</p>
<p>Abstract: Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost, high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization, achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately improve their results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qifeng Cai, Hao Liang, Zhaoyang Han, Hejun Dong, Meiyi Qiang, Ruichuan An, Quanqing Xu, Bin Cui, Wentao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hefei Mei, Zirui Wang, Shen You, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, yet their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant robustness concerns. While existing effective attacks always focus on task-specific white-box settings, these approaches are limited in the context of LVLMs, which are designed for diverse downstream tasks and require expensive full-model gradient computations. Motivated by the pivotal role and wide adoption of the vision encoder in LVLMs, we propose a simple yet effective Vision Encoder Attack (VEAttack), which targets the vision encoder of LVLMs only. Specifically, we propose to generate adversarial examples by minimizing the cosine similarity between the clean and perturbed visual features, without accessing the following large language models, task information, and labels. It significantly reduces the computational overhead while eliminating the task and label dependence of traditional white-box attacks in LVLMs. To make this simple attack effective, we propose to perturb images by optimizing image tokens instead of the classification token. We provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that VEAttack can easily generalize to various tasks. VEAttack has achieved a performance degradation of 94.5% on image caption task and 75.7% on visual question answering task. We also reveal some key observations to provide insights into LVLM attack/defense: 1) hidden layer variations of LLM, 2) token attention differential, 3) M\"obius band in transfer attack, 4) low sensitivity to attack steps.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jue Gong, Tingyu Yang, Jingkai Wang, Zheng Chen, Xing Liu, Hong Gu, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Human-centered images often suffer from severe generic degradation during transmission and are prone to human motion blur (HMB), making restoration challenging. Existing research lacks sufficient focus on these issues, as both problems often coexist in practice. To address this, we design a degradation pipeline that simulates the coexistence of HMB and generic noise, generating synthetic degraded data to train our proposed HAODiff, a human-aware one-step diffusion. Specifically, we propose a triple-branch dual-prompt guidance (DPG), which leverages high-quality images, residual noise (LQ minus HQ), and HMB segmentation masks as training targets. It produces a positive-negative prompt pair for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in a single diffusion step. The resulting adaptive dual prompts let HAODiff exploit CFG more effectively, boosting robustness against diverse degradations. For fair evaluation, we introduce MPII-Test, a benchmark rich in combined noise and HMB cases. Extensive experiments show that our HAODiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality on synthetic and real-world datasets, including our introduced MPII-Test.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyoung Park, Jeehye Na, Jinyoung Kim, Hyunwoo J. Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success using a PPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with group-normalized rewards. However, the effectiveness of GRPO in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we explore GRPO and identify two issues that hinder effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) vanishing advantage. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO loss function as a regression task that directly predicts the advantage in GRPO, eliminating the need for safeguards such as clipping and min operations. This directly aligns the model with the advantages, providing guidance to prefer better outputs. The difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy augments input prompts/videos to target solvable difficulty levels, enabling diverse reward signals. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongyu Wu, Minhua Lin, Zhiwei Zhang, Fali Wang, Xianren Zhang, Xiang Zhang, Suhang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in many downstream tasks. However, LVLMs are trained on large-scale datasets, which can pose privacy risks if training images contain sensitive information. Therefore, it is important to detect whether an image is used to train the LVLM. Recent studies have investigated membership inference attacks (MIAs) against LVLMs, including detecting image-text pairs and single-modality content. In this work, we focus on detecting whether a target image is used to train the target LVLM. We design simple yet effective Image Corruption-Inspired Membership Inference Attacks (ICIMIA) against LVLMs, which are inspired by LVLM's different sensitivity to image corruption for member and non-member images. We first perform an MIA method under the white-box setting, where we can obtain the embeddings of the image through the vision part of the target LVLM. The attacks are based on the embedding similarity between the image and its corrupted version. We further explore a more practical scenario where we have no knowledge about target LVLMs and we can only query the target LVLMs with an image and a textual instruction. We then conduct the attack by utilizing the output text embeddings' similarity. Experiments on existing datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods under those two different settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Intern\`o, Robert Geirhos, Markus Olhofer, Sunny Liu, Barbara Hammer, David Klindt</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Liu, Shuang Li, Eric Cousineau, Siyuan Feng, Benjamin Burchfiel, Shuran Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and predicting dynamics of the physical world can enhance a robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of generated videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. Through this geometric supervision, the model learns a shared 3D scene representation, enabling it to generate spatio-temporally aligned future video sequences from novel viewpoints given a single RGB-D image per view, and without relying on camera poses as input. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, yielding robot manipulation policies that generalize well to novel camera viewpoints.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03262">Investigating Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models with Multiple Vision Encoders</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Wang, Song Mao, Yang Chen, Yufan Shen, Yinqiao Yan, Pinlong Cai, Ding Wang, Guohang Yan, Zhi Yu, Xuming Hu, Botian Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly integrate multiple vision encoders to improve performance on various benchmarks, assuming that diverse pretraining objectives yield complementary visual signals. However, we show this assumption often fails in practice. Through systematic encoder masking across representative multi encoder MLLMs, we find that performance typically degrades gracefully and sometimes even improves when selected encoders are masked, revealing pervasive encoder redundancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce two principled metrics: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), which measures an encoders marginal contribution in the presence of others, and the Information Gap (IG), which captures heterogeneity in encoder utility within a model. Using these tools, we observe (i) strong specialization on tasks like OCR and Chart, where a single encoder can dominate with a CUR greater than 90%, (ii) high redundancy on general VQA and knowledge-based tasks, where encoders are largely interchangeable, (iii) instances of detrimental encoders with negative CUR. Notably, masking specific encoders can yield up to 16% higher accuracy on a specific task category and 3.6% overall performance boost compared to the full model.Furthermore, single and dual encoder variants recover over 90% of baseline on most non OCR tasks. Our analysis challenges the more encoders are better heuristic in MLLMs and provides actionable diagnostics for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However, previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework. By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher (SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-fidelity text-to-image and text-to-video generation typically relies on Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), but achieving optimal results often demands computationally expensive sampling schedules. In this work, we propose MAMBO-G, a training-free acceleration framework that significantly reduces computational cost by dynamically optimizing guidance magnitudes. We observe that standard CFG schedules are inefficient, applying disproportionately large updates in early steps that hinder convergence speed. MAMBO-G mitigates this by modulating the guidance scale based on the update-to-prediction magnitude ratio, effectively stabilizing the trajectory and enabling rapid convergence. This efficiency is particularly vital for resource-intensive tasks like video generation. Our method serves as a universal plug-and-play accelerator, achieving up to 3x speedup on Stable Diffusion v3.5 (SD3.5) and 4x on Lumina. Most notably, MAMBO-G accelerates the 14B-parameter Wan2.1 video model by 2x while preserving visual fidelity, offering a practical solution for efficient large-scale video synthesis. Our implementation follows a mainstream open-source diffusion framework and is plug-and-play with existing pipelines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited. Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models, that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing, reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still yields competitive performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition, we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyu Ren, Yutong Li, Hua Li, Chuhong Wang, Runmin Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive state space context network (ASCNet), which builds upon the state space model mechanism to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we design a Multi-Level Context Module (MLCM), which module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception, allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the Adaptive Patchwise Visual State Space (APVSS) block as the decoder of ASCNet, which integrates our proposed Dynamic Adaptive Granularity Scan (DAGS) and Granularity-aware Propagation Module (GPM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps enhanced by local perception, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing state space model's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</p>

<p>Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.

<p>Abstract: Falls among seniors are a major public health issue. Existing solutions using wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and RGB-based vision systems face challenges in reliability, user compliance, and practicality. Studies indicate that stakeholders, such as older adults and eldercare facilities, prefer non-wearable, passive, privacy-preserving, and real-time fall detection systems that require no user interaction. This study proposes an advanced thermal fall detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures. Among them, BiConvLSTM achieved state-of-the-art performance with a ROC-AUC of $99.7\%$ on the TSF dataset and demonstrated robust results on TF-66, a newly emerged, diverse, and privacy-preserving benchmark. These results highlight the generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable, high-performance solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Xiao, Archit Gupta, Miguel Esparza, Yu-Hsuan Ho, Antonia Sebastian, Hannah Weas, Rose Houck, Ali Mostafavi</p>
<p>Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections, utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level, language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into geospatial and emergency-management workflows.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aymen Bouguerra, Daniel Montoya, Alexandra Gomez-Villa, Chokri Mraidha, Fabio Arnez</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have revolutionized zero-shot classification and safety-critical tasks, including Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, their high computational cost hinders efficient real-world deployment. While quantization is a standard solution for efficiency, its broader impact on reliability metrics beyond simple Top-1 accuracy remains critically under-explored. In this study, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of VLM quantization across a comprehensive experimental suite of over 700k evaluation runs with varying configurations. We find that, contrary to the assumption that quantization's noise degrades performance, it can simultaneously improve accuracy, calibration, OOD detection, and robustness to noise, though not to covariate shift or spurious correlations. We leverage these counterintuitive findings to characterize the mechanics of quantization beyond simple regularization: we show that quantization dampens high-rank spectral components, compelling the model to rely more heavily on robust, low-rank features. Ultimately, this spectral filtering effect drives the observed improvements in generalization and noise tolerance, establishing a pathway to deploy faster, more reliable VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haijier Chen, Bo Xu, Shoujian Zhang, Haoze Liu, Jiaxuan Lin, Jingrong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lei Tong, Zhihua Liu, Chaochao Lu, Dino Oglic, Tom Diethe, Philip Teare, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, Chen Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our method supports causal interventions on target attributes and consistently propagates their effects to causal dependents while preserving the core identity of the image. Unlike prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling with two attribute-regularization strategies: (i) prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and (ii) a conditioned token contrastive loss that disentangles attribute factors and reduces spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including up to a 91% reduction in MAE on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and up to an 87% reduction in FID on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI generation. These results demonstrate robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hezam Albagami, Haitian Wang, Xinyu Wang, Muhammad Ibrahim, Zainy M. Malakan, Abdullah M. Alqamdi, Mohammed H. Alghamdi, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps enable city planning and change detection, which is essential for municipal compliance, map maintenance, and asset monitoring, including both built structures and urban greenery. Conventional Digital Surface Model (DSM) and image differencing are sensitive to vertical bias and viewpoint mismatch, while original point cloud or voxel models require large memory, assume perfect alignment, and degrade thin structures. We propose an uncertainty-aware, object-centric method for city-scale LiDAR-based change detection. Our method aligns data from different time periods using multi-resolution Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) and a point-to-plane Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method, normalizes elevation, and computes a per-point level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate change decisions. Geometry-based associations are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and optimized using class-constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle split-merge cases. Tiled processing bounds memory and preserves narrow ground changes, while instance-level decisions integrate overlap, displacement, and volumetric differences under local detection gating. We perform experiments on a Subiaco (Western Australia) dataset captured in 2023 and again in 2025. Our method achieves 95.3% accuracy, 90.8% mF1, and 82.9% mIoU, improving over the strongest baseline, Triplet KPConv, by 0.3, 0.6, and 1.1 points, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher and student networks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy under limited supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyu Sheng, Jianan Fan, Dongnan Liu, Guoyan Zheng, Ron Kikinis, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization degrade endoscopic frames quality, increasing surgical risk and hindering both clinical decision-making and computer-assisted visual analysis. Therefore, removing surgical smoke is essential for patient safety and operative efficiency. In this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. SurgiATM is designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their accuracy and stability. The proposed method is derived via statistically optimizing MoE model at the output end of arbitrary deep learning methods, with a Laplacian-like error distribution specifically leveraged to model surgical smoke. The output-stage MoE ensures minimal modification to the architecture of the original methods, while the Laplacian-like distribution characteristic of surgical smoke enables a lightweight reconstruction formulation with minimal parameters. Therefore, SurgiATM introduces only two hyperparameters and no extra trainable weights, preserving the original network architecture with minimal overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets, involving multiple network architectures and covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy, and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and generalizability of the proposed method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Isaac Robinson, Peter Robicheaux, Matvei Popov, Deva Ramanan, Neehar Peri</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves over prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is available at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patrick Feifel, Benedikt Franke, Frank Bonarens, Frank K\"oster, Arne Raulf, Friedhelm Schwenker</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiazhen Yan, Ziqiang Li, Fan Wang, Boyu Wang, Ziwen He, Zhangjie Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models such as GANs and diffusion models has led to the widespread proliferation of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy violations, and trust erosion in digital media. Although large-scale multimodal models like CLIP offer strong transferable representations for detecting synthetic content, fine-tuning them often induces catastrophic forgetting, which degrades pre-trained priors and limits cross-domain generalization. To address this issue, we propose the Distillation-guided Gradient Surgery Network (DGS-Net), a novel framework that preserves transferable pre-trained priors while suppressing task-irrelevant components. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-space decomposition that separates harmful and beneficial descent directions during optimization. By projecting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of harmful directions and aligning with beneficial ones distilled from a frozen CLIP encoder, DGS-Net achieves unified optimization of prior preservation and irrelevant suppression. Extensive experiments on 50 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an average margin of 6.6, achieving superior detection performance and generalization across diverse generation techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiongtao Sun, Hui Li, Jiaming Zhang, Yujie Yang, Kaili Liu, Ruxin Feng, Wen Jun Tan, Wei Yang Bryan Lim</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pose significant individual-level privacy risks by linking fragmented multimodal data to identifiable individuals through hierarchical chain-of-thought reasoning. However, existing privacy benchmarks remain structurally insufficient for this threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this gap, we propose MultiPriv, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR) framework and construct a bilingual multimodal dataset with synthetic individual profiles, where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks spanning attribute detection, cross-image re-identification, and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 open-source and commercial VLMs. Our analysis shows that 60 percent of widely used VLMs can perform individual-level privacy reasoning with up to 80 percent accuracy, posing a significant threat to personal privacy. MultiPriv provides a foundation for developing and assessing privacy-preserving VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshan Wu, Yifei Yu, Xiaoyang Lyu, Yihua Huang, Bo Wang, Baoheng Zhang, Zhongrui Wang, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust 3D geometry estimation from videos is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, SLAM, and 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization. Our method enables robust geometry estimation in challenging dynamic low-light scenes without requiring retraining on night-time data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuldip Singh Atwal, Dieter Pfoser, Daniel Rothbart</p>
<p>Abstract: Ongoing armed conflict in Sudan highlights the need for rapid monitoring of conflict-related fire damage. Recent advances in deep learning and high-frequency satellite imagery enable near--real-time assessment of active fires and burn scars in war zones. This study presents a near--real-time monitoring approach using a lightweight Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)-based model integrated with 4-band Planet Labs imagery at 3 m spatial resolution. We demonstrate that conflict-related fire damage can be detected with minimal delay using accessible, commercially available satellite data. To achieve this, we adapt a VAE-based model, originally designed for 10-band imagery, to operate effectively on high-resolution 4-band inputs. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner to learn compact latent representations of nominal land-surface conditions and identify fire-affected areas by quantifying changes between temporally paired latent embeddings. Performance is evaluated across five case studies in Sudan and compared against a cosine-distance baseline computed between temporally paired image tiles using precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving higher recall and F1-scores while maintaining strong precision in highly imbalanced fire-detection scenarios. Experiments with 8-band imagery and temporal image sequences yield only marginal performance gains over single 4-band inputs, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight approach for scalable, near--real-time conflict monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawen Li, Jiali Hu, Xitong Ling, Yongqiang Lv, Yuxuan Chen, Yizhi Wang, Tian Guan, Yifei Liu, Yonghong He</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H\&E) stained pathology images. However, images such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and special stains are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving these non-H\&E images. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a collection of self-supervised foundation models specifically trained for IHC and special stains in pathology images based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet contains a ViT-Small and a ViT-Base model, both of which are trained using a self-distillation SSL approach on over 1.4 million patch images extracted from 20,231 publicly available IHC and special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet models, we conduct experiments on three in-house slide-level IHC classification tasks, three in-house ROI-level special stain and two public ROI-level IHC classification tasks to demonstrate their strong ability. We also perform ablation studies such as few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet models with recent larger PFMs to further highlight their strengths.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanfang Dong, Luke Schultz, Negar Hassanpour, Chao Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Semantic-rich features from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have been leveraged to enhance Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). However, raw VFM features are typically high-dimensional and redundant, increasing the difficulty of learning and reducing training efficiency for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we propose Repack then Refine, a three-stage framework that brings the semantic-rich VFM features to DiT while further accelerating learning efficiency. Specifically, the RePack module projects the high-dimensional features onto a compact, low-dimensional manifold. This filters out the redundancy while preserving essential structural information. A standard DiT is then trained for generative modeling on this highly compressed latent space. Finally, to restore the high-frequency details lost due to the compression in RePack, we propose a Latent-Guided Refiner, which is trained lastly for enhancing the image details. On ImageNet-1K, RePack-DiT-XL/1 achieves an FID of 1.82 in only 64 training epochs. With the Refiner module, performance further improves to an FID of 1.65, significantly surpassing latest LDMs in terms of convergence efficiency. Our results demonstrate that packing VFM features, followed by targeted refinement, is a highly effective strategy for balancing generative fidelity with training efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging are susceptible to shortcut learning, relying on confounding metadata (e.g., scanner model) that is often encoded in image embeddings. The crucial question is whether the model actively utilizes this encoded information for its final prediction. We introduce Weight Space Correlation Analysis, an interpretable methodology that quantifies feature utilization by measuring the alignment between the classification heads of a primary clinical task and auxiliary metadata tasks. We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner). Our methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness, demonstrating that, in the absence of induced bias, the clinical model selectively utilizes features related to the genuine clinical signal.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient discrete video tokenization is essential for long video sequences processing. Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damiano Marsili, Aditya Mehta, Ryan Y. Lin, Georgia Gkioxari</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhang Chen, Yunqiu Xu, Junjie Xie, Aojun Lu, Tao Feng, Zeying Huang, Ning Zhang, Yi Sun, Yi Yang, Hangjie Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, multimodal large language models continue to struggle with visual mathematical problem solving. Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\Rightarrow$internalization$\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matej Mok, Luk\'a\v{s} Gajdo\v{s}ech, Michal Mes\'aro\v{s}, Martin Madaras, Viktor Kocur</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of 6DoF object pose estimation is one of the fundamental problems of 3D vision with many practical applications such as industrial automation. Traditional deep learning approaches for this task often require extensive training data or CAD models, limiting their application in real-world industrial settings where data is scarce and object instances vary. We propose a novel method for 6DoF pose estimation focused specifically on bins used in industrial settings. We exploit the cuboid geometry of bins by first detecting intermediate 3D line segments corresponding to their top edges. Our approach extends the 2D line segment detection network LeTR to operate on structured point cloud data. The detected 3D line segments are then processed using a simple geometric procedure to robustly determine the bin's 6DoF pose. To evaluate our method, we extend an existing dataset with a newly collected and annotated dataset, which we make publicly available. We show that incorporating synthetic training data significantly improves pose estimation accuracy on real scans. Moreover, we show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art 6DoF pose estimation methods in terms of the pose accuracy (3 cm translation error, 8.2$^\circ$ rotation error) while not requiring instance-specific CAD models during inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about the physical world requires spatial intelligence: the ability to interpret geometry, perspective, and spatial relations beyond 2D perception. While recent vision large models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding, they remain fundamentally 2D perceivers and struggle with genuine 3D reasoning. We introduce Think3D, a framework that enables VLM agents to think with 3D space. By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench. We further show that smaller models, which struggle with spatial exploration, benefit significantly from a reinforcement learning policy that enables the model to select informative viewpoints and operations. With RL, the benefit from tool usage increases from +0.7% to +6.8%. Our findings demonstrate that training-free, tool-augmented spatial exploration is a viable path toward more flexible and human-like 3D reasoning in multimodal agents, establishing a new dimension of multimodal intelligence.

<p>Abstract: Multimodal evidence is critical in computational pathology: gigapixel whole slide images capture tumor morphology, while patient-level clinical descriptors preserve complementary context for prognosis. Integrating such heterogeneous signals remains challenging because feature spaces exhibit distinct statistics and scales. We introduce MMSF, a multitask and multimodal supervised framework built on a linear-complexity MIL backbone that explicitly decomposes and fuses cross-modal information. MMSF comprises a graph feature extraction module embedding tissue topology at the patch level, a clinical data embedding module standardizing patient attributes, a feature fusion module aligning modality-shared and modality-specific representations, and a Mamba-based MIL encoder with multitask prediction heads. Experiments on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC demonstrate 2.1--6.6\% accuracy and 2.2--6.9\% AUC improvements over competitive baselines, while evaluations on five TCGA survival cohorts yield 7.1--9.8\% C-index improvements compared with unimodal methods and 5.6--7.1\% over multimodal alternatives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuonan Wang, Wenjie Yan, Wenqiao Zhang, Xiaohui Song, Jian Ma, Ke Yao, Yibo Yu, Beng Chin Ooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image classification is a core task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), playing a pivotal role in early disease detection, treatment planning, and patient prognosis assessment. In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijin Yang, Yu Sun, Kejiang Chen, Jiawei Zhao, Jun Jiang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yufeng Zhong, Lei Chen, Xuanle Zhao, Wenkang Han, Liming Zheng, Jing Huang, Deyang Jiang, Yilin Cao, Lin Ma, Zhixiong Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular. However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (Text-centric OCR), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (Vision-centric OCR), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose OCRVerse, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanmo Chen, Chenghao Xu, Xu Yang, Xuan Chen, Cheng Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanmo Chen, Guangtao Lyu, Chenghao Xu, Jiexi Yan, Xu Yang, Cheng Deng</p>
<p>Abstract: As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens. The code of this work will be released upon acceptance.</p>

<p>Abstract: As realistic AI-generated images threaten digital authenticity, we address the generalization failure of generative artifact-based detectors by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the camera imaging pipeline. Concretely, we investigate color correlations induced by the color filter array (CFA) and demosaicing, and propose a Demosaicing-guided Color Correlation Training (DCCT) framework for AI-generated image detection. By simulating the CFA sampling pattern, we decompose each color image into a single-channel input (as the condition) and the remaining two channels as the ground-truth targets (for prediction). A self-supervised U-Net is trained to model the conditional distribution of the missing channels from the given one, parameterized via a mixture of logistic functions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DCCT targets a provable distributional difference in color-correlation features between photographic and AI-generated images. By leveraging these distinct features to construct a binary classifier, DCCT achieves state-of-the-art generalization and robustness, significantly outperforming prior methods across over 20 unseen generators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anindya Sundar Das, Monowar Bhuyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves strong detection and localization performance, interpretability, and robustness under various levels of data contamination.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel methodology for annotating the brain vasculature using dynamic 4D-CTA head scans. By using multiple time points from dynamic CTA acquisitions, we subtract bone and soft tissue to enhance the visualization of arteries and veins, reducing the effort required to obtain manual annotations of brain vessels. We then train deep learning models on our ground truth annotations by using the same segmentation for multiple phases from the dynamic 4D-CTA collection, effectively enlarging our dataset by 4 to 5 times and inducing robustness to contrast phases. In total, our dataset comprises 110 training images from 25 patients and 165 test images from 14 patients. In comparison with two similarly-sized datasets for CTA-based brain vessel segmentation, a nnUNet model trained on our dataset can achieve significantly better segmentations across all vascular regions, with an average mDC of 0.846 for arteries and 0.957 for veins in the TopBrain dataset. Furthermore, metrics such as average directed Hausdorff distance (adHD) and topology sensitivity (tSens) reflected similar trends: using our dataset resulted in low error margins (adHD of 0.304 mm for arteries and 0.078 for veins) and high sensitivity (tSens of 0.877 for arteries and 0.974 for veins), indicating excellent accuracy in capturing vessel morphology.

<p>Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) demands representations robust to drastic environmental and viewpoint shifts. Current aggregation paradigms, however, either rely on data-hungry supervision or simplistic first-order statistics, often neglecting intrinsic structural correlations. In this work, we propose a Second-Order Geometric Statistics framework that inherently captures geometric stability without training. We conceptualize scenes as covariance descriptors on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold, where perturbations manifest as tractable congruence transformations. By leveraging geometry-aware Riemannian mappings, we project these descriptors into a linearized Euclidean embedding, effectively decoupling signal structure from noise. Our approach introduces a training-free framework built upon fixed, pre-trained backbones, achieving strong zero-shot generalization without parameter updates. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves highly competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, particularly excelling in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p>

Existing forensic models, primarily trained on natural images, often underperform on biomedical data where subtle manipulations can compromise experimental validity.

Our design integrates lightweight SSM-inspired linear attention mechanisms to enable efficient, fine-grained localization. Trained end-to-end, BioTamperNet simultaneously identifies tampered regions and their source counterparts.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan, Debottam Dutta, Yu-Lin Wei, Romit Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>Abstract: Imagine Alice has a specific image $x^\ast$ in her mind, say, the view of the street in which she grew up during her childhood. To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unified multimodal models often struggle with complex synthesis tasks that demand deep reasoning, and typically treat text-to-image generation and image editing as isolated capabilities rather than interconnected reasoning steps. To address this, we propose UniReason, a unified framework that harmonizes these two tasks through two complementary reasoning paradigms. We incorporate world knowledge-enhanced textual reasoning into generation to infer implicit knowledge, and leverage editing capabilities for fine-grained editing-like visual refinement to further correct visual errors via self-reflection. This approach unifies generation and editing within a shared architecture, mirroring the human cognitive process of planning followed by refinement. We support this framework by systematically constructing a large-scale reasoning-centric dataset (~300k samples) covering five major knowledge domains (e.g., cultural commonsense, physics, etc.) for textual reasoning, alongside an agent-generated corpus for visual refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sunoh Kim, Kimin Yun, Daeho Um</p>
<p>Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal video grounding aims to localize query-relevant segments in untrimmed videos using only video-sentence pairs, without requiring ground-truth segment annotations that specify exact temporal boundaries. Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of GBO across various proposal schemes. The code is available at https://github.com/sunoh-kim/gbo.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Karpekov, Archith Iyer, Sourish Gunesh Dhekane, Sonia Chernova, Thomas Pl\"otz</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart homes equipped with ambient sensors offer a transformative approach to continuous health monitoring and assisted living. Traditional research in this domain primarily focuses on Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which relies on mapping sensor data to a closed set of predefined activity labels. However, the fixed granularity of these labels often constrains their practical utility, failing to capture the subtle, household-specific nuances essential, for example, for tracking individual health over time. To address this, we propose DISCOVER, a framework for discovering and annotating Patterns of Daily Living (PDL) - fine-grained, recurring sequences of sensor events that emerge directly from a resident's unique routines. DISCOVER utilizes a self-supervised feature extraction and representation-aware clustering pipeline, supported by a custom visualization interface that enables experts to interpret and label discovered patterns with minimal effort. Our evaluation across multiple smart-home environments demonstrates that DISCOVER identifies cohesive behavioral clusters with high inter-rater agreement while achieving classification performance comparable to fully-supervised baselines using only 0.01% of the labels. Beyond reducing annotation overhead, DISCOVER establishes a foundation for longitudinal analysis. By grounding behavior in a resident's specific environment rather than rigid semantic categories, our framework facilitates the observation of within-person habitual drift. This capability positions the system as a potential tool for identifying subtle behavioral indicators associated with early-stage cognitive decline in future longitudinal studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> In\^es Cardoso Oliveira, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Luis A. Leiva</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a powerful type of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in various image synthesis tasks and have shown potential in other domains, such as natural language processing and temporal data modeling. Despite their stable training dynamics and ability to produce diverse high-quality samples, DMs are notorious for requiring significant computational resources, both in the training and inference stages. Previous work has focused mostly on increasing the efficiency of model inference. This paper introduces, for the first time, the paradigm of sparse-to-sparse training to DMs, with the aim of improving both training and inference efficiency. We focus on unconditional generation and train sparse DMs from scratch (Latent Diffusion and ChiroDiff) on six datasets using three different methods (Static-DM, RigL-DM, and MagRan-DM) to study the effect of sparsity in model performance. Our experiments show that sparse DMs are able to match and often outperform their Dense counterparts, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters and FLOPs. We also identify safe and effective values to perform sparse-to-sparse training of DMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitian Wang, Xinyu Wang, Yiren Wang, Bo Miao, Atif Mansoor</p>
<p>Abstract: On-device skin lesion analysis is constrained by the compute and energy cost of conventional CNN inference and by the need to update models as new patient data become available. Neuromorphic processors provide event-driven sparse computation and support on-chip incremental learning, yet deployment is often hindered by CNN-to-SNN conversion failures, including non-spike-compatible operators and accuracy degradation under class imbalance. We propose QANA, a quantization-aware CNN backbone embedded in an end-to-end pipeline engineered for conversion-stable neuromorphic execution. QANA replaces conversion-fragile components with spike-compatible transformations by bounding intermediate activations and aligning normalization with low-bit quantization, reducing conversion-induced distortion that disproportionately impacts rare classes. Efficiency is achieved through Ghost-based feature generation under tight FLOP budgets, while spatially-aware efficient channel attention and squeeze-and-excitation recalibrate channels without heavy global operators that are difficult to map to spiking cores. The resulting quantized projection head produces SNN-ready logits and enables incremental updates on edge hardware without full retraining or data offloading. On HAM10000, QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 91.0% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.5 percentage points in Top-1 accuracy (a 4.0% relative gain) and by 12.0 points in macro F1 (a 15.2% relative gain). On a clinical dataset, QANA achieves 90.8% Top-1 accuracy and 81.7% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.2 points in Top-1 accuracy (a 3.7% relative gain) and by 3.6 points in macro F1 (a 4.6% relative gain). When deployed on BrainChip Akida, QANA runs in 1.5 ms per image with 1.7 mJ per image, corresponding to 94.6% lower latency and 99.0% lower energy than its GPU-based CNN implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhe Li, Yutao Cui, Tao Huang, Yinping Ma, Chun Fan, Miles Yang, Zhao Zhong, Liefeng Bo</p>
<p>Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO and DanceGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for faster sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Han Zhang, Zhantao Yang, Fangyi Chen, Zihan Wang, Anudeepsekhar Bolimera, Marios Savvides</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning, which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H, STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3% higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently outperforms across all OOD benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Vincent Tu, Chih-Lun Lee, Jiachen Yang, Ang Li, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their performance on long-horizon, complex problems remains unreliable. Single-rollout execution is brittle, with small errors compounding over time and leading to high variance in outcomes. While prior work has attempted to scale within a single rollout, such approaches have yielded limited gains. Scaling over multiple rollouts offers a more promising alternative but doing so effectively is challenging due to the difficulty of evaluating and selecting among long-horizon agent behaviors. We introduce Behavior Judge (BJudge), which addresses this challenge by representing agent executions as behavior narratives and comparing candidate behaviors at this level, substantially improving robustness and success rates. Using multiple rollouts, BJudge establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) in OSWorld at 72.6%, significantly outperforming prior methods and surpassing human-level performance at 72.36%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the strong effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and BJudge provides a practical framework to achieve this.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingtong Yue, Ziqi Huang, Zhaoxi Chen, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rupam Mukherjee, Rajkumar Daniel, Soujanya Hazra, Shirin Dasgupta, Subhamoy Mandal</p>
<p>Abstract: Early detection of oral cancer and potentially malignant diseases is a major challenge in low-resource settings due to the scarcity of annotated data. We provide a unified approach for four-class oral lesion classification that incorporates deep learning, spectral analysis, and demographic data. A pathologist-verified subset of oral cavity images was curated from a publicly available dataset. Oral cavity pictures were processed using a fine-tuned ConvNeXt-v2 network for deep embeddings before being translated into the hyperspectral domain using a reconstruction algorithm. Haemoglobin-sensitive, textural, and spectral descriptors were obtained from the reconstructed hyperspectral cubes and combined with demographic data. Multiple machine-learning models were evaluated using patient-specific validation. Finally, an incremental heuristic meta-learner (IHML) was developed that merged calibrated base classifiers via probabilistic feature stacking and uncertainty-aware abstraction of multimodal representations with patient-level smoothing. By decoupling evidence extraction from decision fusion, IHML stabilizes predictions in heterogeneous, small-sample medical datasets. On an unseen test set, our proposed model achieved a macro F1 of 66.23% and an overall accuracy of 64.56%. The findings demonstrate that RGB-to-hyperspectral reconstruction and ensemble meta-learning improve diagnostic robustness in real-world oral lesion screening.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training. We release our models, along with the available data and code to derive these models.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16419">Learning Domain Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Models through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qinglong Cao, Yuntian Chen, Chao Ma, Xiaokang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal perception and understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks. Our results highlight the necessity of optimization-level domain knowledge integration and reveal a fundamental limitation of textual domain conditioning in current MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Robin Young, Srinivasan Keshav</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass density estimation from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LIDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are widely used, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We show that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning architecture that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and exploits geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing estimates to be more uncertain in complex landscapes and less in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from tropical Amazonian forests to boreal, temperate, and alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhixian Zhao, Wenjie Tian, Lei Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal emotion analysis is shifting from static classification to generative reasoning. Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a "perceive-then-reason" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Ni, Weijia Zhang, Fei Wang, Zezhi Shao, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective numerical-visual modality integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhehao Xu, Lok Ming Lui</p>
<p>Abstract: Many genus-0 surface mapping tasks such as landmark alignment, feature matching, and image-driven registration, can be reduced (via an initial spherical conformal map) to optimizing a spherical self-homeomorphism with controlled distortion. However, existing works lack efficient mechanisms to control the geometric distortion of the resulting mapping. To resolve this issue, we formulate this as a Beltrami-space optimization problem, where the angle distortion is encoded explicitly by the Beltrami differential and bijectivity can be enforced through the constraint $\|\mu\|_{\infty}<1$. To make this practical on the sphere, we introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, together with cross-chart consistency conditions that yield a globally bijective spherical deformation (up to conformal automorphisms). Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network, we develop BOOST, a differentiable optimization framework that updates two Beltrami fields to minimize task-driven losses while regularizing distortion and enforcing consistency along the seam. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate improved task performance meanwhile maintaining controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior. We also apply the method to cortical surface registration by aligning sulcal landmarks and matching cortical sulcal depth, achieving comparative or better registration performance without sacrificing geometric validity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.
