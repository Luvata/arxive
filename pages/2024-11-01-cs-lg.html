<p><b>Authors:</b> Remya Ajai A S, Nithin Nagaraj</p>
<p>Abstract: Inspired by the human brain's structure and function, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were developed for data classification. However, existing Neural Networks, including Deep Neural Networks, do not mimic the brain's rich structure. They lack key features such as randomness and neuron heterogeneity, which are inherently chaotic in their firing behavior. Neurochaos Learning (NL), a chaos-based neural network, recently employed one-dimensional chaotic maps like Generalized L\"uroth Series (GLS) and Logistic map as neurons. For the first time, we propose a random heterogeneous extension of NL, where various chaotic neurons are randomly placed in the input layer, mimicking the randomness and heterogeneous nature of human brain networks. We evaluated the performance of the newly proposed Random Heterogeneous Neurochaos Learning (RHNL) architectures combined with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods. On public datasets, RHNL outperformed both homogeneous NL and fixed heterogeneous NL architectures in nearly all classification tasks. RHNL achieved high F1 scores on the Wine dataset (1.0), Bank Note Authentication dataset (0.99), Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (0.99), and Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD) (0.98). These RHNL results are among the best in the literature for these datasets. We investigated RHNL performance on image datasets, where it outperformed stand-alone ML classifiers. In low training sample regimes, RHNL was the best among stand-alone ML. Our architecture bridges the gap between existing ANN architectures and the human brain's chaotic, random, and heterogeneous properties. We foresee the development of several novel learning algorithms centered around Random Heterogeneous Neurochaos Learning in the coming days.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seunghan Lee, Juri Hong, Kibok Lee, Taeyoung Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers, offering near-linear complexity in processing sequential data. However, while channels in time series (TS) data have no specific order in general, recent studies have adopted Mamba to capture channel dependencies (CD) in TS, introducing a sequential order bias. To address this issue, we propose SOR-Mamba, a TS forecasting method that 1) incorporates a regularization strategy to minimize the discrepancy between two embedding vectors generated from data with reversed channel orders, thereby enhancing robustness to channel order, and 2) eliminates the 1D-convolution originally designed to capture local information in sequential data. Furthermore, we introduce channel correlation modeling (CCM), a pretraining task aimed at preserving correlations between channels from the data space to the latent space in order to enhance the ability to capture CD. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across standard and transfer learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/seunghan96/SOR-Mamba.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abulikemu Abuduweili, Changliu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring neural network robustness is essential for the safe and reliable operation of robotic learning systems, especially in perception and decision-making tasks within real-world environments. This paper investigates the robustness of neural networks in perception systems, specifically examining their sensitivity to targeted, small-scale perturbations. We identify the Lipschitz constant as a key metric for quantifying and enhancing network robustness. We derive an analytical expression to compute the Lipschitz constant based on neural network architecture, providing a theoretical basis for estimating and improving robustness. Several experiments reveal the relationship between network design, the Lipschitz constant, and robustness, offering practical insights for developing safer, more robust robot learning systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Efra\'in Maga\~na, Simone Pezzuto, Francisco Sahli Costabal</p>
<p>Abstract: The anisotropic structure of the myocardium is a key determinant of the cardiac function. To date, there is no imaging modality to assess in-vivo the cardiac fiber structure. We recently proposed Fibernet, a method for the automatic identification of the anisotropic conduction -- and thus fibers -- in the atria from local electrical recordings. Fibernet uses cardiac activation as recorded during electroanatomical mappings to infer local conduction properties using physics-informed neural networks. In this work, we extend Fibernet to cope with the uncertainty in the estimated fiber field. Specifically, we use an ensemble of neural networks to produce multiple samples, all fitting the observed data, and compute posterior statistics. We also introduce a methodology to select the best fiber orientation members and define the input of the neural networks directly on the atrial surface. With these improvements, we outperform the previous methodology in terms of fiber orientation error in 8 different atrial anatomies. Currently, our approach can estimate the fiber orientation and conduction velocities in under 7 minutes with quantified uncertainty, which opens the door to its application in clinical practice. We hope the proposed methodology will enable further personalization of cardiac digital twins for precision medicine.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haixiang sun, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ), which serves as a typical implicit neural network, emphasizes their memory efficiency and competitive performance compared to explicit neural networks. However, there has been relatively limited theoretical analysis on the representation of DEQ. In this paper, we utilize the Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) as a tool to systematically analyze the representation of DEQ under both balanced and imbalanced conditions. $\mathcal{NC}$ is an interesting phenomenon in the neural network training process that characterizes the geometry of class features and classifier weights. While extensively studied in traditional explicit neural networks, the $\mathcal{NC}$ phenomenon has not received substantial attention in the context of implicit neural networks. We theoretically show that $\mathcal{NC}$ exists in DEQ under balanced conditions. Moreover, in imbalanced settings, despite the presence of minority collapse, DEQ demonstrated advantages over explicit neural networks. These advantages include the convergence of extracted features to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame and self-duality properties under mild conditions, highlighting DEQ's superiority in handling imbalanced datasets. Finally, we validate our theoretical analyses through experiments in both balanced and imbalanced scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a framework that integrates variational autoencoders (VAE) with reinforcement learning (RL) to balance system performance and resource usage in multi-agent systems by dynamically adjusting network structures over time. A key innovation of this method is its capability to handle the vast action space of the network structure. This is achieved by combining Variational Auto-Encoder and Deep Reinforcement Learning to control the latent space encoded from the network structures. The proposed method, evaluated on the modified OpenAI particle environment under various scenarios, not only demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines but also reveals interesting strategies and insights through the learned behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiliang Chen, Babak Heydari</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective governance and steering of behavior in complex multi-agent systems (MAS) are essential for managing system-wide outcomes, particularly in environments where interactions are structured by dynamic networks. In many applications, the goal is to promote pro-social behavior among agents, where network structure plays a pivotal role in shaping these interactions. This paper introduces a Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning (HGRL) framework that governs such systems through targeted interventions in the network structure. Operating within the constraints of limited managerial authority, the HGRL framework demonstrates superior performance across a range of environmental conditions, outperforming established baseline methods. Our findings highlight the critical influence of agent-to-agent learning (social learning) on system behavior: under low social learning, the HGRL manager preserves cooperation, forming robust core-periphery networks dominated by cooperators. In contrast, high social learning accelerates defection, leading to sparser, chain-like networks. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of the system manager's authority level in preventing system-wide failures, such as agent rebellion or collapse, positioning HGRL as a powerful tool for dynamic network-based governance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23398">On the Optimality of Dilated Entropy and Lower Bounds for Online Learning in Extensive-Form Games</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Fan, Christian Kroer, Gabriele Farina</p>
<p>Abstract: First-order methods (FOMs) are arguably the most scalable algorithms for equilibrium computation in large extensive-form games. To operationalize these methods, a distance-generating function, acting as a regularizer for the strategy space, must be chosen. The ratio between the strong convexity modulus and the diameter of the regularizer is a key parameter in the analysis of FOMs. A natural question is then: what is the optimal distance-generating function for extensive-form decision spaces? In this paper, we make a number of contributions, ultimately establishing that the weight-one dilated entropy (DilEnt) distance-generating function is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The DilEnt regularizer is notable due to its iterate-equivalence with Kernelized OMWU (KOMWU) -- the algorithm with state-of-the-art dependence on the game tree size in extensive-form games -- when used in conjunction with the online mirror descent (OMD) algorithm. However, the standard analysis for OMD is unable to establish such a result; the only current analysis is by appealing to the iterate equivalence to KOMWU. We close this gap by introducing a pair of primal-dual treeplex norms, which we contend form the natural analytic viewpoint for studying the strong convexity of DilEnt. Using these norm pairs, we recover the diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio that predicts the same performance as KOMWU. Along with a new regret lower bound for online learning in sequence-form strategy spaces, we show that this ratio is nearly optimal. Finally, we showcase our analytic techniques by refining the analysis of Clairvoyant OMD when paired with DilEnt, establishing an $\mathcal{O}(n \log |\mathcal{V}| \log T/T)$ approximation rate to coarse correlated equilibrium in $n$-player games, where $|\mathcal{V}|$ is the number of reduced normal-form strategies of the players, establishing the new state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anuroop Sriram, Benjamin Kurt Miller, Ricky T. Q. Chen, Brandon M. Wood</p>
<p>Abstract: Material discovery is a critical area of research with the potential to revolutionize various fields, including carbon capture, renewable energy, and electronics. However, the immense scale of the chemical space makes it challenging to explore all possible materials experimentally. In this paper, we introduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models (LLMs) and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) to design novel crystalline materials. FlowLLM first fine-tunes an LLM to learn an effective base distribution of meta-stable crystals in a text representation. After converting to a graph representation, the RFM model takes samples from the LLM and iteratively refines the coordinates and lattice parameters. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation rate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for stable, unique, and novel crystals by $\sim50\%$ - a huge improvement on a difficult problem. Additionally, the crystals generated by FlowLLM are much closer to their relaxed state when compared with another leading model, significantly reducing post-hoc computational cost.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23419">Stepping Out of the Shadows: Reinforcement Learning in Shadow Mode</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Gassert, Matthias Althoff</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is not yet competitive for many cyber-physical systems, such as robotics, process automation, and power systems, as training on a system with physical components cannot be accelerated, and simulation models do not exist or suffer from a large simulation-to-reality gap. During the long training time, expensive equipment cannot be used and might even be damaged due to inappropriate actions of the reinforcement learning agent. Our novel approach addresses exactly this problem: We train the reinforcement agent in a so-called shadow mode with the assistance of an existing conventional controller, which does not have to be trained and instantaneously performs reasonably well. In shadow mode, the agent relies on the controller to provide action samples and guidance towards favourable states to learn the task, while simultaneously estimating for which states the learned agent will receive a higher reward than the conventional controller. The RL agent will then control the system for these states and all other regions remain under the control of the existing controller. Over time, the RL agent will take over for an increasing amount of states, while leaving control to the baseline, where it cannot surpass its performance. Thus, we keep regret during training low and improve the performance compared to only using conventional controllers or reinforcement learning. We present and evaluate two mechanisms for deciding whether to use the RL agent or the conventional controller. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated for a reach-avoid task, for which we are able to effectively train an agent, where standard approaches fail.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung-Tien Huang, Maxwell Lennon, Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar, Sean Sylvia, Junier B. Oliva</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Information Sub-Selection (DISS), a novel framework of AI assistance designed to enhance the performance of black-box decision-makers by tailoring their information processing on a per-instance basis. Blackbox decision-makers (e.g., humans or real-time systems) often face challenges in processing all possible information at hand (e.g., due to cognitive biases or resource constraints), which can degrade decision efficacy. DISS addresses these challenges through policies that dynamically select the most effective features and options to forward to the black-box decision-maker for prediction. We develop a scalable frequentist data acquisition strategy and a decision-maker mimicking technique for enhanced budget efficiency. We explore several impactful applications of DISS, including biased decision-maker support, expert assignment optimization, large language model decision support, and interpretability. Empirical validation of our proposed DISS methodology shows superior performance to state-of-the-art methods across various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vineet Sunil Gattani, Junshan Zhang, Gautam Dasarathy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale federated learning (FL) over wireless multiple access channels (MACs) has emerged as a crucial learning paradigm with a wide range of applications. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by several major challenges, including limited bandwidth shared by many edge devices, noisy and erroneous wireless communications, and heterogeneous datasets with different distributions across edge devices. To overcome these fundamental challenges, we propose Federated Proximal Sketching (FPS), tailored towards band-limited wireless channels and handling data heterogeneity across edge devices. FPS uses a count sketch data structure to address the bandwidth bottleneck and enable efficient compression while maintaining accurate estimation of significant coordinates. Additionally, we modify the loss function in FPS such that it is equipped to deal with varying degrees of data heterogeneity. We establish the convergence of the FPS algorithm under mild technical conditions and characterize how the bias induced due to factors like data heterogeneity and noisy wireless channels play a role in the overall result. We complement the proposed theoretical framework with numerical experiments that demonstrate the stability, accuracy, and efficiency of FPS in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Overall, our results show that FPS is a promising solution to tackling the above challenges of FL over wireless MACs.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23434">Model-free Low-Rank Reinforcement Learning via Leveraged Entry-wise Matrix Estimation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Stefan Stojanovic, Yassir Jedra, Alexandre Proutiere</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in controlled dynamical systems with low-rank latent structure. For this problem, we present LoRa-PI (Low-Rank Policy Iteration), a model-free learning algorithm alternating between policy improvement and policy evaluation steps. In the latter, the algorithm estimates the low-rank matrix corresponding to the (state, action) value function of the current policy using the following two-phase procedure. The entries of the matrix are first sampled uniformly at random to estimate, via a spectral method, the leverage scores of its rows and columns. These scores are then used to extract a few important rows and columns whose entries are further sampled. The algorithm exploits these new samples to complete the matrix estimation using a CUR-like method. For this leveraged matrix estimation procedure, we establish entry-wise guarantees that remarkably, do not depend on the coherence of the matrix but only on its spikiness. These guarantees imply that LoRa-PI learns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy using $\widetilde{O}({S+A\over \mathrm{poly}(1-\gamma)\varepsilon^2})$ samples where $S$ (resp. $A$) denotes the number of states (resp. actions) and $\gamma$ the discount factor. Our algorithm achieves this order-optimal (in $S$, $A$ and $\varepsilon$) sample complexity under milder conditions than those assumed in previously proposed approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance text generation by incorporating external knowledge but often struggle when retrieving context across different text modalities due to semantic gaps. We introduce a generalized projection-based method, inspired by adapter modules in transfer learning, that efficiently bridges these gaps between various text types, such as programming code and pseudocode, or English and French sentences. Our approach emphasizes speed, accuracy, and data efficiency, requiring minimal resources for training and inference. By aligning embeddings from heterogeneous text modalities into a unified space through a lightweight projection network, our model significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods like the Okapi BM25 algorithm and models like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), while approaching the accuracy of Sentence Transformers. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across different tasks, highlighting its potential for real-time, resource-constrained applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunwei Ren, Zixuan Wang, Jason D. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have excelled in natural language modeling and one reason behind this success is their exceptional ability to combine contextual informal and global knowledge. However, the theoretical basis remains unclear. In this paper, first we introduce the Sparse Contextual Bigram (SCB), a natural extension of the classical bigram model, where the next token's generation depends on a sparse set of earlier positions determined by the last token. We then analyze the training dynamics and sample complexity of learning SCB using a one-layer linear transformer with a gradient-based algorithm. We show that when trained from scratch, the training process can be split into an initial sample-intensive stage where the correlation is boosted from zero to a nontrivial value, followed by a more sample-efficient stage of further improvement. Additionally, we prove that, provided a nontrivial correlation between the downstream and pretraining tasks, finetuning from a pretrained model allows us to bypass the initial sample-intensive stage. We also empirically demonstrate that our algorithm can outperform SGD in this setting and discuss its relationship with the usual softmax-based transformers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Adcock, Michael Griebel, Gregor Maier</p>
<p>Abstract: Operator learning, the approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using ideas from machine learning, has gained increasing research attention in recent years. Approximate operators, learned from data, hold promise to serve as efficient surrogate models for problems in computational science and engineering, complementing traditional numerical methods. However, despite their empirical success, our understanding of the underpinning mathematical theory is in large part still incomplete. In this paper, we study the approximation of Lipschitz operators in expectation with respect to Gaussian measures. We prove higher Gaussian Sobolev regularity of Lipschitz operators and establish lower and upper bounds on the Hermite polynomial approximation error. We further consider the reconstruction of Lipschitz operators from $m$ arbitrary (adaptive) linear samples. A key finding is the tight characterization of the smallest achievable error for all possible (adaptive) sampling and reconstruction maps in terms of $m$. It is shown that Hermite polynomial approximation is an optimal recovery strategy, but we have the following curse of sample complexity: No method to approximate Lipschitz operators based on finitely many samples can achieve algebraic convergence rates in $m$. On the positive side, we prove that a sufficiently fast spectral decay of the covariance operator of the Gaussian measure guarantees convergence rates which are arbitrarily close to any algebraic rate in the large data limit $m \to \infty$. Finally, we focus on the recovery of Lipschitz operators from finitely many point samples. We consider Christoffel sampling and weighted least-squares approximation, and present an algorithm which provably achieves near-optimal sample complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruhan Wang, Yu Yang, Zhishuai Liu, Dongruo Zhou, Pan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: We study offline off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL) to utilize data from an easily accessible source domain to enhance policy learning in a target domain with limited data. Our approach centers on return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL), particularly focusing on the decision transformer (DT), which can predict actions conditioned on desired return guidance and complete trajectory history. Previous works tackle the dynamics shift problem by augmenting the reward in the trajectory from the source domain to match the optimal trajectory in the target domain. However, this strategy can not be directly applicable in RCSL owing to (1) the unique form of the RCSL policy class, which explicitly depends on the return, and (2) the absence of a straightforward representation of the optimal trajectory distribution. We propose the Return Augmented Decision Transformer (RADT) method, where we augment the return in the source domain by aligning its distribution with that in the target domain. We provide the theoretical analysis demonstrating that the RCSL policy learned from RADT achieves the same level of suboptimality as would be obtained without a dynamics shift. We introduce two practical implementations RADT-DARA and RADT-MV respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on D4RL datasets reveal that our methods generally outperform dynamic programming based methods in off-dynamics RL scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jay Bear, Adam Pr\"ugel-Bennett, Jonathon Hare</p>
<p>Abstract: Iterative algorithms solve problems by taking steps until a solution is reached. Models in the form of Deep Thinking (DT) networks have been demonstrated to learn iterative algorithms in a way that can scale to different sized problems at inference time using recurrent computation and convolutions. However, they are often unstable during training, and have no guarantees of convergence/termination at the solution. This paper addresses the problem of instability by analyzing the growth in intermediate representations, allowing us to build models (referred to as Deep Thinking with Lipschitz Constraints (DT-L)) with many fewer parameters and providing more reliable solutions. Additionally our DT-L formulation provides guarantees of convergence of the learned iterative procedure to a unique solution at inference time. We demonstrate DT-L is capable of robustly learning algorithms which extrapolate to harder problems than in the training set. We benchmark on the traveling salesperson problem to evaluate the capabilities of the modified system in an NP-hard problem where DT fails to learn.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omar Montasser, Han Shao, Emmanuel Abbe</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning with identical train and test distributions has been extensively investigated both practically and theoretically. Much remains to be understood, however, in statistical learning under distribution shifts. This paper focuses on a distribution shift setting where train and test distributions can be related by classes of (data) transformation maps. We initiate a theoretical study for this framework, investigating learning scenarios where the target class of transformations is either known or unknown. We establish learning rules and algorithmic reductions to Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), accompanied with learning guarantees. We obtain upper bounds on the sample complexity in terms of the VC dimension of the class composing predictors with transformations, which we show in many cases is not much larger than the VC dimension of the class of predictors. We highlight that the learning rules we derive offer a game-theoretic viewpoint on distribution shift: a learner searching for predictors and an adversary searching for transformation maps to respectively minimize and maximize the worst-case loss.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Lien Bolager, Ana Cukarska, Iryna Burak, Zahra Monfared, Felix Dietrich</p>
<p>Abstract: Recurrent neural networks are a successful neural architecture for many time-dependent problems, including time series analysis, forecasting, and modeling of dynamical systems. Training such networks with backpropagation through time is a notoriously difficult problem because their loss gradients tend to explode or vanish. In this contribution, we introduce a computational approach to construct all weights and biases of a recurrent neural network without using gradient-based methods. The approach is based on a combination of random feature networks and Koopman operator theory for dynamical systems. The hidden parameters of a single recurrent block are sampled at random, while the outer weights are constructed using extended dynamic mode decomposition. This approach alleviates all problems with backpropagation commonly related to recurrent networks. The connection to Koopman operator theory also allows us to start using results in this area to analyze recurrent neural networks. In computational experiments on time series, forecasting for chaotic dynamical systems, and control problems, as well as on weather data, we observe that the training time and forecasting accuracy of the recurrent neural networks we construct are improved when compared to commonly used gradient-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruda Zhang, Negin Alemazkoor</p>
<p>Abstract: In system analysis and design optimization, multiple computational models are typically available to represent a given physical system. These models can be broadly classified as high-fidelity models, which provide highly accurate predictions but require significant computational resources, and low-fidelity models, which are computationally efficient but less accurate. Multi-fidelity methods integrate high- and low-fidelity models to balance computational cost and predictive accuracy. This perspective paper provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of machine learning-based multi-fidelity methods, with a particular emphasis on uncertainty quantification and optimization. For uncertainty quantification, a particular focus is on multi-fidelity graph neural networks, compared with multi-fidelity polynomial chaos expansion. For optimization, our emphasis is on multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, offering a unified perspective on multi-fidelity priors and proposing an application strategy when the objective function is an integral or a weighted sum. We highlight the current state of the art, identify critical gaps in the literature, and outline key research opportunities in this evolving field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Collado, Kevin Stangl</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent approaches in machine learning often solve a task using a composition of multiple models or agentic architectures. When targeting a composed system with adversarial attacks, it might not be computationally or informationally feasible to train an end-to-end proxy model or a proxy model for every component of the system. We introduce a method to craft an adversarial attack against the overall multi-model system when we only have a proxy model for the final black-box model, and when the transformation applied by the initial models can make the adversarial perturbations ineffective. Current methods handle this by applying many copies of the first model/transformation to an input and then re-use a standard adversarial attack by averaging gradients, or learning a proxy model for both stages. To our knowledge, this is the first attack specifically designed for this threat model and our method has a substantially higher attack success rate (80% vs 25%) and contains 9.4% smaller perturbations (MSE) compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments focus on a supervised image pipeline, but we are confident the attack will generalize to other multi-model settings [e.g. a mix of open/closed source foundation models], or agentic systems</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baekrok Shin, Junsoo Oh, Hanseul Cho, Chulhee Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Warm-starting neural network training by initializing networks with previously learned weights is appealing, as practical neural networks are often deployed under a continuous influx of new data. However, it often leads to loss of plasticity, where the network loses its ability to learn new information, resulting in worse generalization than training from scratch. This occurs even under stationary data distributions, and its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We develop a framework emulating real-world neural network training and identify noise memorization as the primary cause of plasticity loss when warm-starting on stationary data. Motivated by this, we propose Direction-Aware SHrinking (DASH), a method aiming to mitigate plasticity loss by selectively forgetting memorized noise while preserving learned features. e validate our approach on vision tasks, demonstrating improvements in test accuracy and training efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning utilizing kernel ridge regression to predict the expected value function represents a powerful method with great representational capacity. This setting is a highly versatile framework amenable to analytical results. We consider kernel-based function approximation for RL in the infinite horizon average reward setting, also referred to as the undiscounted setting.

We establish novel no-regret performance guarantees for our algorithm, under kernel-based modelling assumptions. Additionally, we derive a novel confidence interval for the kernel-based prediction of the expected value function, applicable across various RL problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kurt Butler, Daniel Waxman, Petar M. Djuri\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal discovery with time series data remains a challenging yet increasingly important task across many scientific domains. Convergent cross mapping (CCM) and related methods have been proposed to study time series that are generated by dynamical systems, where traditional approaches like Granger causality are unreliable. However, CCM often yields inaccurate results depending upon the quality of the data. We propose the Tangent Space Causal Inference (TSCI) method for detecting causalities in dynamical systems. TSCI works by considering vector fields as explicit representations of the systems' dynamics and checks for the degree of synchronization between the learned vector fields. The TSCI approach is model-agnostic and can be used as a drop-in replacement for CCM and its generalizations. We first present a basic version of the TSCI algorithm, which is shown to be more effective than the basic CCM algorithm with very little additional computation. We additionally present augmented versions of TSCI that leverage the expressive power of latent variable models and deep learning. We validate our theory on standard systems, and we demonstrate improved causal inference performance across a number of benchmark tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Santino Nanini, Mariem Abid, Yassir Mamouni, Arnaud Wiedemann, Philippe Jouvet, Stephane Bourassa</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents the development of machine learning (ML) models to predict hypoxemia severity during emergency triage, especially in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) events, using physiological data from medical-grade sensors. Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and sequential models (LSTM, GRU) were trained on physiological and demographic data from the MIMIC-III and IV datasets. A robust preprocessing pipeline addressed missing data, class imbalances, and incorporated synthetic data flagged with masks. Gradient Boosting Models (GBMs) outperformed sequential models in terms of training speed, interpretability, and reliability, making them well-suited for real-time decision-making. While their performance was comparable to that of sequential models, the GBMs used score features from six physiological variables derived from the enhanced National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2, which we termed NEWS2+. This approach significantly improved prediction accuracy. While sequential models handled temporal data well, their performance gains did not justify the higher computational cost. A 5-minute prediction window was chosen for timely intervention, with minute-level interpolations standardizing the data. Feature importance analysis highlighted the significant role of mask and score features in enhancing both transparency and performance. Temporal dependencies proved to be less critical, as Gradient Boosting Models were able to capture key patterns effectively without relying on them. This study highlights ML's potential to improve triage and reduce alarm fatigue. Future work will integrate data from multiple hospitals to enhance model generalizability across clinical settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edward S. Hu, Kwangjun Ahn, Qinghua Liu, Haoran Xu, Manan Tomar, Ada Langford, Dinesh Jayaraman, Alex Lamb, John Langford</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the "Belief State Transformer", a next-token predictor that takes both a prefix and suffix as inputs, with a novel objective of predicting both the next token for the prefix and the previous token for the suffix. The Belief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical ablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult scenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing with known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the Fill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved performance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State Transformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time inference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yutong Gao, Vince D. Calhoun, Robyn L. Miller</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the relationship between cognition and intrinsic brain activity through purely data-driven approaches remains a significant challenge in neuroscience. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers a non-invasive method to monitor regional neural activity, providing a rich and complex spatiotemporal data structure. Deep learning has shown promise in capturing these intricate representations. However, the limited availability of large datasets, especially for disease-specific groups such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), constrains the generalizability of deep learning models. In this study, we focus on multivariate time series forecasting of independent component networks derived from rs-fMRI as a form of data augmentation, using both a conventional LSTM-based model and the novel Transformer-based BrainLM model. We assess their utility in AD classification, demonstrating how generative forecasting enhances classification performance. Post-hoc interpretation of BrainLM reveals class-specific brain network sensitivities associated with AD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Agent learning from human interaction often relies on explicit signals, but implicit social cues, such as prosody in speech, could provide valuable information for more effective learning. This paper advocates for the integration of prosody as a teaching signal to enhance agent learning from human teachers. Through two exploratory studies--one examining voice feedback in an interactive reinforcement learning setup and the other analyzing restricted audio from human demonstrations in three Atari games--we demonstrate that prosody carries significant information about task dynamics. Our findings suggest that prosodic features, when coupled with explicit feedback, can enhance reinforcement learning outcomes. Moreover, we propose guidelines for prosody-sensitive algorithm design and discuss insights into teaching behavior. Our work underscores the potential of leveraging prosody as an implicit signal for more efficient agent learning, thus advancing human-agent interaction paradigms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yujie Zhao, Jose Efraim Aguilar Escamill, Weyl Lu, Huazheng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) studies the problem where agents receive only preferences over pairs of trajectories in each episode. Traditional approaches in this field have predominantly focused on the mean reward or utility criterion. However, in PbRL scenarios demanding heightened risk awareness, such as in AI systems, healthcare, and agriculture, risk-aware measures are requisite. Traditional risk-aware objectives and algorithms are not applicable in such one-episode-reward settings. To address this, we explore and prove the applicability of two risk-aware objectives to PbRL: nested and static quantile risk objectives. We also introduce Risk-Aware- PbRL (RA-PbRL), an algorithm designed to optimize both nested and static objectives. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the regret upper bounds, demonstrating that they are sublinear with respect to the number of episodes, and present empirical results to support our findings.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Lo, Albert Q. Jiang, Wenda Li, Mateja Jamnik</p>
<p>Abstract: Ontologies are useful for automatic machine processing of domain knowledge as they represent it in a structured format. Yet, constructing ontologies requires substantial manual effort. To automate part of this process, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to solve various subtasks of ontology learning. However, this partial ontology learning does not capture the interactions between subtasks. We address this gap by introducing OLLM, a general and scalable method for building the taxonomic backbone of an ontology from scratch. Rather than focusing on subtasks, like individual relations between entities, we model entire subcomponents of the target ontology by finetuning an LLM with a custom regulariser that reduces overfitting on high-frequency concepts. We introduce a novel suite of metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated ontology by measuring its semantic and structural similarity to the ground truth. In contrast to standard metrics, our metrics use deep learning techniques to define more robust distance measures between graphs. Both our quantitative and qualitative results on Wikipedia show that OLLM outperforms subtask composition methods, producing more semantically accurate ontologies while maintaining structural integrity. We further demonstrate that our model can be effectively adapted to new domains, like arXiv, needing only a small number of training examples. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/andylolu2/ollm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiguo Gao, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world data is often assumed to lie within a low-dimensional structure embedded in high-dimensional space. In practical settings, we observe only a finite set of samples, forming what we refer to as the sample data subspace. It serves an essential approximation supporting tasks such as dimensionality reduction and generation. A major challenge lies in whether generative models can reliably synthesize samples that stay within this subspace rather than drifting away from the underlying structure. In this work, we provide theoretical insights into this challenge by leveraging Flow Matching models, which transform a simple prior into a complex target distribution via a learned velocity field. By treating the real data distribution as discrete, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal velocity field under a Gaussian prior, showing that generated samples memorize real data points and represent the sample data subspace exactly. To generalize to suboptimal scenarios, we introduce the Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition Network (OSDNet), which systematically decomposes the velocity field into subspace and off-subspace components. Our analysis shows that the off-subspace component decays, while the subspace component generalizes within the sample data subspace, ensuring generated samples preserve both proximity and diversity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Skyler Wu, Fred Lu, Edward Raff, James Holt</p>
<p>Abstract: Online learning methods, like the seminal Passive-Aggressive (PA) classifier, are still highly effective for high-dimensional streaming data, out-of-core processing, and other throughput-sensitive applications. Many such algorithms rely on fast adaptation to individual errors as a key to their convergence. While such algorithms enjoy low theoretical regret, in real-world deployment they can be sensitive to individual outliers that cause the algorithm to over-correct. When such outliers occur at the end of the data stream, this can cause the final solution to have unexpectedly low accuracy. We design a weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) approach to obtain a stable ensemble model from the sequence of solutions without requiring additional passes over the data, hold-out sets, or a growing amount of memory. Our key insight is that good solutions tend to be error-free for more iterations than bad solutions, and thus, the number of passive rounds provides an estimate of a solution's relative quality. Our reservoir thus contains $K$ previous intermediate weight vectors with high survival times. We demonstrate our WRS approach on the Passive-Aggressive Classifier (PAC) and First-Order Sparse Online Learning (FSOL), where our method consistently and significantly outperforms the unmodified approach. We show that the risk of the ensemble classifier is bounded with respect to the regret of the underlying online learning method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Welch, Jiaqi Zhang, Caroline Uhler</p>
<p>Abstract: Causal disentanglement aims to learn about latent causal factors behind data, holding the promise to augment existing representation learning methods in terms of interpretability and extrapolation. Recent advances establish identifiability results assuming that interventions on (single) latent factors are available; however, it remains debatable whether such assumptions are reasonable due to the inherent nature of intervening on latent variables. Accordingly, we reconsider the fundamentals and ask what can be learned using just observational data.
  We provide a precise characterization of latent factors that can be identified in nonlinear causal models with additive Gaussian noise and linear mixing, without any interventions or graphical restrictions. In particular, we show that the causal variables can be identified up to a layer-wise transformation and that further disentanglement is not possible. We transform these theoretical results into a practical algorithm consisting of solving a quadratic program over the score estimation of the observed data. We provide simulation results to support our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our algorithm can derive meaningful causal representations from purely observational data.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper introduces the first generalization and adaptation benchmark using machine learning for evaluating out-of-distribution performance of electromyography (EMG) classification algorithms. The ability of an EMG classifier to handle inputs drawn from a different distribution than the training distribution is critical for real-world deployment as a control interface. By predicting the user's intended gesture using EMG signals, we can create a wearable solution to control assistive technologies, such as computers, prosthetics, and mobile manipulator robots. This new out-of-distribution benchmark consists of two major tasks that have utility for building robust and adaptable control interfaces: 1) intersubject classification and 2) adaptation using train-test splits for time-series. This benchmark spans nine datasets--the largest collection of EMG datasets in a benchmark. Among these, a new dataset is introduced, featuring a novel, easy-to-wear high-density EMG wearable for data collection. The lack of open-source benchmarks has made comparing accuracy results between papers challenging for the EMG research community. This new benchmark provides researchers with a valuable resource for analyzing practical measures of out-of-distribution performance for EMG datasets. Our code and data from our new dataset can be found at emgbench.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Udaya Ghai, Karan Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: The theory of boosting provides a computational framework for aggregating approximate weak learning algorithms, which perform marginally better than a random predictor, into an accurate strong learner. In the realizable case, the success of the boosting approach is underscored by a remarkable fact that the resultant sample complexity matches that of a computationally demanding alternative, namely Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). This in particular implies that the realizable boosting methodology has the potential to offer computational relief without compromising on sample efficiency.
  Despite recent progress, in agnostic boosting, where assumptions on the conditional distribution of labels given feature descriptions are absent, ERM outstrips the agnostic boosting methodology in being quadratically more sample efficient than all known agnostic boosting algorithms. In this paper, we make progress on closing this gap, and give a substantially more sample efficient agnostic boosting algorithm than those known, without compromising on the computational (or oracle) complexity. A key feature of our algorithm is that it leverages the ability to reuse samples across multiple rounds of boosting, while guaranteeing a generalization error strictly better than those obtained by blackbox applications of uniform convergence arguments. We also apply our approach to other previously studied learning problems, including boosting for reinforcement learning, and demonstrate improved results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy McMahan, Xiaojin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce anytime constraints to the multi-agent setting with the corresponding solution concept being anytime-constrained equilibrium (ACE). Then, we present a comprehensive theory of anytime-constrained Markov games, which includes (1) a computational characterization of feasible policies, (2) a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for computing ACE, and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm for approximately computing feasible ACE. Since computing a feasible policy is NP-hard even for two-player zero-sum games, our approximation guarantees are the best possible under worst-case analysis. We also develop the first theory of efficient computation for action-constrained Markov games, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanjoy Dasgupta, Geelon So</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realizable online setting, a learner is tasked with making predictions for a stream of instances, where the correct answer is revealed after each prediction. A learning rule is online consistent if its mistake rate eventually vanishes. The nearest neighbor rule (Fix and Hodges, 1951) is a fundamental prediction strategy, but it is only known to be consistent under strong statistical or geometric assumptions: the instances come i.i.d. or the label classes are well-separated. We prove online consistency for all measurable functions in doubling metric spaces under the mild assumption that the instances are generated by a process that is uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to a finite, upper doubling measure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guan-Hua Huang, Wan-Chen Lai, Tai-Been Chen, Chien-Chin Hsu, Huei-Yung Chen, Yi-Chen Wu, Li-Ren Yeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, is commonly diagnosed using functional medical imaging techniques such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In this study, we utilized two SPECT data sets (n = 634 and n = 202) from different hospitals to develop a model capable of accurately predicting PD stages, a multiclass classification task. We used the entire three-dimensional (3D) brain images as input and experimented with various model architectures. Initially, we treated the 3D images as sequences of two-dimensional (2D) slices and fed them sequentially into 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) models pretrained on ImageNet, averaging the outputs to obtain the final predicted stage. We also applied 3D CNN models pretrained on Kinetics-400. Additionally, we incorporated an attention mechanism to account for the varying importance of different slices in the prediction process. To further enhance model efficacy and robustness, we simultaneously trained the two data sets using weight sharing, a technique known as cotraining. Our results demonstrated that 2D models pretrained on ImageNet outperformed 3D models pretrained on Kinetics-400, and models utilizing the attention mechanism outperformed both 2D and 3D models. The cotraining technique proved effective in improving model performance when the cotraining data sets were sufficiently large.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minghui Chen, Meirui Jiang, Xin Zhang, Qi Dou, Zehua Wang, Xiaoxiao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a learning paradigm that enables collaborative training of models using decentralized data. Recently, the utilization of pre-trained weight initialization in FL has been demonstrated to effectively improve model performance. However, the evolving complexity of current pre-trained models, characterized by a substantial increase in parameters, markedly intensifies the challenges associated with communication rounds required for their adaptation to FL. To address these communication cost issues and increase the performance of pre-trained model adaptation in FL, we propose an innovative model interpolation-based local training technique called ``Local Superior Soups.'' Our method enhances local training across different clients, encouraging the exploration of a connected low-loss basin within a few communication rounds through regularized model interpolation. This approach acts as a catalyst for the seamless adaptation of pre-trained models in in FL. We demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency across diverse widely-used FL datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alistair White, Anna B\"uttner, Maximilian Gelbrecht, Valentin Duruisseaux, Niki Kilbertus, Frank Hellmann, Niklas Boers</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural differential equations offer a powerful approach for learning dynamics from data. However, they do not impose known constraints that should be obeyed by the learned model. It is well-known that enforcing constraints in surrogate models can enhance their generalizability and numerical stability. In this paper, we introduce projected neural differential equations (PNDEs), a new method for constraining neural differential equations based on projection of the learned vector field to the tangent space of the constraint manifold. In tests on several challenging examples, including chaotic dynamical systems and state-of-the-art power grid models, PNDEs outperform existing methods while requiring fewer hyperparameters. The proposed approach demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the modeling of constrained dynamical systems, particularly in complex domains where accuracy and reliability are essential.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junsoo Oh, Chulhee Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Patch-level data augmentation techniques such as Cutout and CutMix have demonstrated significant efficacy in enhancing the performance of vision tasks. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. In this paper, we study two-layer neural networks trained using three distinct methods: vanilla training without augmentation, Cutout training, and CutMix training. Our analysis focuses on a feature-noise data model, which consists of several label-dependent features of varying rarity and label-independent noises of differing strengths. Our theorems demonstrate that Cutout training can learn low-frequency features that vanilla training cannot, while CutMix training can learn even rarer features that Cutout cannot capture. From this, we establish that CutMix yields the highest test accuracy among the three. Our novel analysis reveals that CutMix training makes the network learn all features and noise vectors "evenly" regardless of the rarity and strength, which provides an interesting insight into understanding patch-level augmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soichiro Kumano, Hiroshi Kera, Toshihiko Yamasaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial examples have raised several open questions, such as why they can deceive classifiers and transfer between different models. A prevailing hypothesis to explain these phenomena suggests that adversarial perturbations appear as random noise but contain class-specific features. This hypothesis is supported by the success of perturbation learning, where classifiers trained solely on adversarial examples and the corresponding incorrect labels generalize well to correctly labeled test data. Although this hypothesis and perturbation learning are effective in explaining intriguing properties of adversarial examples, their solid theoretical foundation is limited. In this study, we theoretically explain the counterintuitive success of perturbation learning. We assume wide two-layer networks and the results hold for any data distribution. We prove that adversarial perturbations contain sufficient class-specific features for networks to generalize from them. Moreover, the predictions of classifiers trained on mislabeled adversarial examples coincide with those of classifiers trained on correctly labeled clean samples.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weichao Zhou, Wenchao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Many imitation learning (IL) algorithms use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to infer a reward function that aligns with the demonstration. However, the inferred reward functions often fail to capture the underlying task objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for IRL-based IL that prioritizes task alignment over conventional data alignment. Our framework is a semi-supervised approach that leverages expert demonstrations as weak supervision to derive a set of candidate reward functions that align with the task rather than only with the data. It then adopts an adversarial mechanism to train a policy with this set of reward functions to gain a collective validation of the policy's ability to accomplish the task. We provide theoretical insights into this framework's ability to mitigate task-reward misalignment and present a practical implementation. Our experimental results show that our framework outperforms conventional IL baselines in complex and transfer learning scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junshu Sun, Chenxue Yang, Xiangyang Ji, Qingming Huang, Shuhui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Message passing plays a vital role in graph neural networks (GNNs) for effective feature learning. However, the over-reliance on input topology diminishes the efficacy of message passing and restricts the ability of GNNs. Despite efforts to mitigate the reliance, existing study encounters message-passing bottlenecks or high computational expense problems, which invokes the demands for flexible message passing with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic message-passing mechanism for GNNs. It projects graph nodes and learnable pseudo nodes into a common space with measurable spatial relations between them. With nodes moving in the space, their evolving relations facilitate flexible pathway construction for a dynamic message-passing process. Associating pseudo nodes to input graphs with their measured relations, graph nodes can communicate with each other intermediately through pseudo nodes under linear complexity. We further develop a GNN model named $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ based on our dynamic message-passing mechanism. $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ employs a single recurrent layer to recursively generate the displacements of nodes and construct optimal dynamic pathways. Evaluation on eighteen benchmarks demonstrates the superior performance of $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ over popular GNNs. $\mathtt{\mathbf{N^2}}$ successfully scales to large-scale benchmarks and requires significantly fewer parameters for graph classification with the shared recurrent layer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Holt, Tennison Liu, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are computational models that simulate the states and temporal dynamics of real-world systems, playing a crucial role in prediction, understanding, and decision-making across diverse domains. However, existing approaches to DTs often struggle to generalize to unseen conditions in data-scarce settings, a crucial requirement for such models. To address these limitations, our work begins by establishing the essential desiderata for effective DTs. Hybrid Digital Twins ($\textbf{HDTwins}$) represent a promising approach to address these requirements, modeling systems using a composition of both mechanistic and neural components. This hybrid architecture simultaneously leverages (partial) domain knowledge and neural network expressiveness to enhance generalization, with its modular design facilitating improved evolvability. While existing hybrid models rely on expert-specified architectures with only parameters optimized on data, $\textit{automatically}$ specifying and optimizing HDTwins remains intractable due to the complex search space and the need for flexible integration of domain priors. To overcome this complexity, we propose an evolutionary algorithm ($\textbf{HDTwinGen}$) that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously propose, evaluate, and optimize HDTwins. Specifically, LLMs iteratively generate novel model specifications, while offline tools are employed to optimize emitted parameters. Correspondingly, proposed models are evaluated and evolved based on targeted feedback, enabling the discovery of increasingly effective hybrid models. Our empirical results reveal that HDTwinGen produces generalizable, sample-efficient, and evolvable models, significantly advancing DTs' efficacy in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenhan Chang, Tianqing Zhu, Yufeng Wu, Wanlei Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, privacy protection has become crucial, giving rise to machine unlearning. Machine unlearning is a technique that removes specific data influences from trained models without the need for extensive retraining. However, it faces several key challenges, including accurately implementing unlearning, ensuring privacy protection during the unlearning process, and achieving effective unlearning without significantly compromising model performance. This paper presents a novel approach to machine unlearning by employing Layer-wise Relevance Analysis and Neuronal Path Perturbation. We address three primary challenges: the lack of detailed unlearning principles, privacy guarantees in zero-shot unlearning scenario, and the balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Our method balances machine unlearning performance and model utility by identifying and perturbing highly relevant neurons, thereby achieving effective unlearning. By using data not present in the original training set during the unlearning process, we satisfy the zero-shot unlearning scenario and ensure robust privacy protection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively removes targeted data from the target unlearning model while maintaining the model's utility, offering a practical solution for privacy-preserving machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Huang, Skyler Seto, Samira Abnar, David Grangier, Navdeep Jaitly, Josh Susskind</p>
<p>Abstract: Large pretrained vision-language models like CLIP have shown promising generalization capability, but may struggle in specialized domains (e.g., satellite imagery) or fine-grained classification (e.g., car models) where the visual concepts are unseen or under-represented during pretraining. Prompt learning offers a parameter-efficient finetuning framework that can adapt CLIP to downstream tasks even when limited annotation data are available. In this paper, we improve prompt learning by distilling the textual knowledge from natural language prompts (either human- or LLM-generated) to provide rich priors for those under-represented concepts. We first obtain a prompt ``summary'' aligned to each input image via a learned prompt aggregator. Then we jointly train a prompt generator, optimized to produce a prompt embedding that stays close to the aggregated summary while minimizing task loss at the same time. We dub such prompt embedding as Aggregate-and-Adapted Prompt Embedding (AAPE). AAPE is shown to be able to generalize to different downstream data distributions and tasks, including vision-language understanding tasks (e.g., few-shot classification, VQA) and generation tasks (image captioning) where AAPE achieves competitive performance. We also show AAPE is particularly helpful to handle non-canonical and OOD examples. Furthermore, AAPE learning eliminates LLM-based inference cost as required by baselines, and scales better with data and LLM model size.</p>

<p>Abstract: Offline evaluation of LLMs is crucial in understanding their capacities, though current methods remain underexplored in existing research. In this work, we focus on the offline evaluation of the chain-of-thought capabilities and show how to optimize LLMs based on the proposed evaluation method. To enable offline feedback with rich knowledge and reasoning paths, we use knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata5m) to provide feedback on the generated chain of thoughts. Due to the heterogeneity between LLM reasoning and KG structures, direct interaction and feedback from KGs on LLM behavior are challenging, as they require accurate entity linking and grounding of LLM-generated chains of thought in the KG. To address the above challenge, we propose an offline chain-of-thought evaluation framework, OCEAN, which models chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs as an MDP and evaluate the policy's alignment with KG preference modeling. To overcome the reasoning heterogeneity and grounding problems, we leverage on-policy KG exploration and RL to model a KG policy that generates token-level likelihood distributions for LLM-generated chain-of-thought reasoning paths, simulating KG reasoning preference. Then we incorporate the knowledge-graph feedback on the validity and alignment of the generated reasoning paths into inverse propensity scores and propose KG-IPS estimator. Theoretically, we prove the unbiasedness of the proposed KG-IPS estimator and provide a lower bound on its variance. With the off-policy evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to further enhance chain-of-thought alignment. Our empirical study shows that OCEAN can be efficiently optimized for generating chain-of-thought reasoning paths with higher estimated values without affecting LLMs' general abilities in downstream tasks or their internal knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> JaeYoon Kim, Junyu Xuan, Christy Liang, Farookh Hussain</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) leverages both pre-trained offline policies and online policies trained for downstream tasks, aiming to improve data efficiency and accelerate performance enhancement. An existing approach, Policy Expansion (PEX), utilizes a policy set composed of both policies without modifying the offline policy for exploration and learning. However, this approach fails to ensure sufficient learning of the online policy due to an excessive focus on exploration with both policies. Since the pre-trained offline policy can assist the online policy in exploiting a downstream task based on its prior experience, it should be executed effectively and tailored to the specific requirements of the downstream task. In contrast, the online policy, with its immature behavioral strategy, has the potential for exploration during the training phase. Therefore, our research focuses on harmonizing the advantages of the offline policy, termed exploitation, with those of the online policy, referred to as exploration, without modifying the offline policy. In this study, we propose an innovative offline-to-online RL method that employs a non-monolithic exploration approach. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance compared to PEX.</p>

<p>Abstract: The desires for better prediction accuracy and higher execution performance in neural networks never end. Neural architecture search (NAS) and tensor compilers are two popular techniques to optimize these two goals, but they are both limited to composing or optimizing existing manually designed operators rather than coming up with completely new designs. In this work, we explore the less studied direction of neural operator synthesis, which aims to automatically and efficiently discover novel neural operators with better accuracy and/or speed. We develop an end-to-end framework Syno, to realize practical neural operator synthesis. Syno makes use of a novel set of fine-grained primitives defined on tensor dimensions, which ensure various desired properties to ease model training, and also enable expression canonicalization techniques to avoid redundant candidates during search. Syno further adopts a novel guided synthesis flow to obtain valid operators matched with the specified input/output dimension sizes, and leverages efficient stochastic tree search algorithms to quickly explore the design space. We demonstrate that Syno discovers better operators with an average of $2.06\times$ speedup and less than $1\%$ accuracy loss, even on NAS-optimized models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23748">Exploring Consistency in Graph Representations:from Graph Kernels to Graph Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuyuan Liu, Yinghao Cai, Qihui Yang, Yujun Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach in graph representation learning, yet they often struggle to capture consistent similarity relationships among graphs. While graph kernel methods such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) kernels are effective in capturing similarity relationships, they rely heavily on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearity for more complex data patterns. Our work aims to bridge the gap between neural network methods and kernel approaches by enabling GNNs to consistently capture relational structures in their learned representations. Given the analogy between the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly compare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that the similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically consistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent iterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel. Inspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the similarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing relational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we propose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be consistent across different layers. Our empirical analysis verifies our conjecture and shows that our proposed consistency loss can significantly enhance graph classification performance across several GNN backbones on various datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mastering games is a hard task, as games can be extremely complex, and still fundamentally different in structure from one another. While the AlphaZero algorithm has demonstrated an impressive ability to learn the rules and strategy of a large variety of games, ranging from Go and Chess, to Atari games, its reliance on extensive computational resources and rigid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture limits its adaptability and scalability. A model trained to play on a $19\times 19$ Go board cannot be used to play on a smaller $13\times 13$ board, despite the similarity between the two Go variants. In this paper, we focus on Chess, and explore using a more generic Graph-based Representation of a game state, rather than a grid-based one, to introduce a more general architecture based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). We also expand the classical Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer to incorporate edge-features, to naturally provide a generic policy output format. Our experiments, performed on smaller networks than the initial AlphaZero paper, show that this new architecture outperforms previous architectures with a similar number of parameters, being able to increase playing strength an order of magnitude faster. We also show that the model, when trained on a smaller $5\times 5$ variant of chess, is able to be quickly fine-tuned to play on regular $8\times 8$ chess, suggesting that this approach yields promising generalization abilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gunnar K\"onig, Eric G\"unther, Ulrike von Luxburg</p>
<p>Abstract: In explainable machine learning, global feature importance methods try to determine how much each individual feature contributes to predicting the target variable, resulting in one importance score for each feature. But often, predicting the target variable requires interactions between several features (such as in the XOR function), and features might have complex statistical dependencies that allow to partially replace one feature with another one. In commonly used feature importance scores these cooperative effects are conflated with the features' individual contributions, making them prone to misinterpretations. In this work, we derive DIP, a new mathematical decomposition of individual feature importance scores that disentangles three components: the standalone contribution and the contributions stemming from interactions and dependencies. We prove that the DIP decomposition is unique and show how it can be estimated in practice. Based on these results, we propose a new visualization of feature importance scores that clearly illustrates the different contributions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongying Liu, Hao Wang, Haoran Chu, Yibo Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: An unsolved issue in widely used methods such as Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and Small Sphere and Large Margin SVM (SSLM) for anomaly detection is their nonconvexity, which hampers the analysis of optimal solutions in a manner similar to SVMs and limits their applicability in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel convex SSLM formulation which has been demonstrated to revert to a convex quadratic programming problem for hyperparameter values of interest. Leveraging the convexity of our method, we derive numerous results that are unattainable with traditional nonconvex approaches. We conduct a thorough analysis of how hyperparameters influence the optimal solution, pointing out scenarios where optimal solutions can be trivially found and identifying instances of ill-posedness. Most notably, we establish connections between our method and traditional approaches, providing a clear determination of when the optimal solution is unique -- a task unachievable with traditional nonconvex methods. We also derive the {\nu}-property to elucidate the interactions between hyperparameters and the fractions of support vectors and margin errors in both positive and negative classes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23808">One Sample Fits All: Approximating All Probabilistic Values Simultaneously and Efficiently</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Weida Li, Yaoliang Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: The concept of probabilistic values, such as Beta Shapley values and weighted Banzhaf values, has gained recent attention in applications like feature attribution and data valuation. However, exact computation of these values is often exponentially expensive, necessitating approximation techniques. Prior research has shown that the choice of probabilistic values significantly impacts downstream performance, with no universally superior option. Consequently, one may have to approximate multiple candidates and select the best-performing one. Although there have been many efforts to develop efficient estimators, none are intended to approximate all probabilistic values both simultaneously and efficiently. In this work, we embark on the first exploration of achieving this goal. Adhering to the principle of maximum sample reuse, we propose a one-sample-fits-all framework parameterized by a sampling vector to approximate intermediate terms that can be converted to any probabilistic value without amplifying scalars. Leveraging the concept of $ (\epsilon, \delta) $-approximation, we theoretically identify a key formula that effectively determines the convergence rate of our framework. By optimizing the sampling vector using this formula, we obtain i) a one-for-all estimator that achieves the currently best time complexity for all probabilistic values on average, and ii) a faster generic estimator with the sampling vector optimally tuned for each probabilistic value. Particularly, our one-for-all estimator achieves the fastest convergence rate on Beta Shapley values, including the well-known Shapley value, both theoretically and empirically. Finally, we establish a connection between probabilistic values and the least square regression used in (regularized) datamodels, showing that our one-for-all estimator can solve a family of datamodels simultaneously.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce the Continuous Arcade Learning Environment (CALE), an extension of the well-known Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) [Bellemare et al., 2013]. The CALE uses the same underlying emulator of the Atari 2600 gaming system (Stella), but adds support for continuous actions. This enables the benchmarking and evaluation of continuous-control agents (such as PPO [Schulman et al., 2017] and SAC [Haarnoja et al., 2018]) and value-based agents (such as DQN [Mnih et al., 2015] and Rainbow [Hessel et al., 2018]) on the same environment suite. We provide a series of open questions and research directions that CALE enables, as well as initial baseline results using Soft Actor-Critic.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Nardi, Jinpei Han, Shlomi Haar, A. Aldo Faisal</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) can capture the geometric properties of neural representations in EEG data. Here we utilise those to study how reinforcement-based motor learning affects neural activity patterns during motor planning, leveraging the inherent graph structure of EEG channels to capture the spatial relationships in brain activity. By exploiting task-specific symmetries, we define different pretraining strategies that not only improve model performance across all participant groups but also validate the robustness of the geometric representations. Explainability analysis based on the graph structures reveals consistent group-specific neural signatures that persist across pretraining conditions, suggesting stable geometric structures in the neural representations associated with motor learning and feedback processing. These geometric patterns exhibit partial invariance to certain task space transformations, indicating symmetries that enable generalisation across conditions while maintaining specificity to individual learning strategies. This work demonstrates how GNNs can uncover the effects of previous outcomes on motor planning, in a complex real-world task, providing insights into the geometric principles governing neural representations. Our experimental design bridges the gap between controlled experiments and ecologically valid scenarios, offering new insights into the organisation of neural representations during naturalistic motor learning, which may open avenues for exploring fundamental principles governing brain activity in complex tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seijin Kobayashi, Yassir Akram, Johannes Von Oswald</p>
<p>Abstract: The effect of regularizers such as weight decay when training deep neural networks is not well understood. We study the influence of weight decay as well as $L2$-regularization when training neural network models in which parameter matrices interact multiplicatively. This combination is of particular interest as this parametrization is common in attention layers, the workhorse of transformers. Here, key-query, as well as value-projection parameter matrices, are multiplied directly with each other: $W_K^TW_Q$ and $PW_V$. We extend previous results and show on one hand that any local minimum of a $L2$-regularized loss of the form $L(AB^\top) + \lambda (\|A\|^2 + \|B\|^2)$ coincides with a minimum of the nuclear norm-regularized loss $L(AB^\top) + \lambda\|AB^\top\|_*$, and on the other hand that the 2 losses become identical exponentially quickly during training. We thus complement existing works linking $L2$-regularization with low-rank regularization, and in particular, explain why such regularization on the matrix product affects early stages of training. Based on these theoretical insights, we verify empirically that the key-query and value-projection matrix products $W_K^TW_Q, PW_V$ within attention layers, when optimized with weight decay, as usually done in vision tasks and language modelling, indeed induce a significant reduction in the rank of $W_K^TW_Q$ and $PW_V$, even in fully online training. We find that, in accordance with existing work, inducing low rank in attention matrix products can damage language model performance, and observe advantages when decoupling weight decay in attention layers from the rest of the parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjun Jun, Jiwoo Park, Kyobin Choo, Tae Eun Choi, Seong Jae Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentangled representation learning (DRL) aims to break down observed data into core intrinsic factors for a profound understanding of the data. In real-world scenarios, manually defining and labeling these factors are non-trivial, making unsupervised methods attractive. Recently, there have been limited explorations of utilizing diffusion models (DMs), which are already mainstream in generative modeling, for unsupervised DRL. They implement their own inductive bias to ensure that each latent unit input to the DM expresses only one distinct factor. In this context, we design Dynamic Gaussian Anchoring to enforce attribute-separated latent units for more interpretable DRL. This unconventional inductive bias explicitly delineates the decision boundaries between attributes while also promoting the independence among latent units. Additionally, we also propose Skip Dropout technique, which easily modifies the denoising U-Net to be more DRL-friendly, addressing its uncooperative nature with the disentangling feature extractor. Our methods, which carefully consider the latent unit semantics and the distinct DM structure, enhance the practicality of DM-based disentangled representations, demonstrating state-of-the-art disentanglement performance on both synthetic and real data, as well as advantages in downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youngjoon Lee, Jinu Gong, Joonhyuk Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model while maintaining data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the Non-IID nature of data distribution across devices often hinders model convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we propose a novel plugin for federated optimization techniques that approximates Non-IID data distributions to IID through generative AI-enhanced data augmentation and balanced sampling strategy. Key idea is to synthesize additional data for underrepresented classes on each edge device, leveraging generative AI to create a more balanced dataset across the FL network. Additionally, a balanced sampling approach at the central server selectively includes only the most IID-like devices, accelerating convergence while maximizing the global model's performance. Experimental results validate that our approach significantly improves convergence speed and robustness against data imbalance, establishing a flexible, privacy-preserving FL plugin that is applicable even in data-scarce environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this work, we generalize the ideas of Kaiming initialization to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and propose a new scheme (G-Init) that reduces oversmoothing, leading to very good results in node and graph classification tasks. GNNs are commonly initialized using methods designed for other types of Neural Networks, overlooking the underlying graph topology. We analyze theoretically the variance of signals flowing forward and gradients flowing backward in the class of convolutional GNNs. We then simplify our analysis to the case of the GCN and propose a new initialization method. Our results indicate that the new method (G-Init) reduces oversmoothing in deep GNNs, facilitating their effective use. Experimental validation supports our theoretical findings, demonstrating the advantages of deep networks in scenarios with no feature information for unlabeled nodes (i.e., ``cold start'' scenario).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Griesbach, Carlo D'Eramo</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration is a crucial and distinctive aspect of reinforcement learning (RL) that remains a fundamental open problem. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge. Commonly used methods inject random noise directly into the actions, indirectly via entropy maximization, or add intrinsic rewards that encourage the agent to steer to novel regions of the state space. Another previously seen idea is to use the Bellman error as a separate optimization objective for exploration. In this paper, we introduce three modifications to stabilize the latter and arrive at a deterministic exploration policy. Our separate exploration agent is informed about the state of the exploitation, thus enabling it to account for previous experiences. Further components are introduced to make the exploration objective agnostic toward the episode length and to mitigate instability introduced by far-off-policy learning. Our experimental results show that our approach can outperform $\varepsilon$-greedy in dense and sparse reward settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kentaro Hino, Yuki Kurashige</p>
<p>Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Klea Ziu, Slavom\'ir Hanzely, Loka Li, Kun Zhang, Martin Tak\'a\v{c}, Dmitry Kamzolov</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning the structure of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) presents a significant challenge due to the vast combinatorial search space of possible graphs, which scales exponentially with the number of nodes. Recent advancements have redefined this problem as a continuous optimization task by incorporating differentiable acyclicity constraints. These methods commonly rely on algebraic characterizations of DAGs, such as matrix exponentials, to enable the use of gradient-based optimization techniques. Despite these innovations, existing methods often face optimization difficulties due to the highly non-convex nature of DAG constraints and the per-iteration computational complexity. In this work, we present a novel framework for learning DAGs, employing a Stochastic Approximation approach integrated with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)-based optimization techniques. Our framework introduces new projection methods tailored to efficiently enforce DAG constraints, ensuring that the algorithm converges to a feasible local minimum. With its low iteration complexity, the proposed method is well-suited for handling large-scale problems with improved computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework through comprehensive experimental evaluations, which confirm its superior performance across various settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the cooperative stochastic $k$-armed bandit problem, where a network of $m$ agents collaborate to find the optimal action. In contrast to most prior work on this problem, which focuses on extending a specific algorithm to the multi-agent setting, we provide a black-box reduction that allows us to extend any single-agent bandit algorithm to the multi-agent setting. Under mild assumptions on the bandit environment, we prove that our reduction transfers the regret guarantees of the single-agent algorithm to the multi-agent setting. These guarantees are tight in subgaussian environments, in that using a near minimax optimal single-player algorithm is near minimax optimal in the multi-player setting up to an additive graph-dependent quantity. Our reduction and theoretical results are also general, and apply to many different bandit settings. By plugging in appropriate single-player algorithms, we can easily develop provably efficient algorithms for many multi-player settings such as heavy-tailed bandits, duelling bandits and bandits with local differential privacy, among others. Experimentally, our approach is competitive with or outperforms specialised multi-agent algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiwot Belay Tadesse, Alihan H\"uy\"uk, Weiwei Pan, Finale Doshi-Velez</p>
<p>Abstract: When explaining black-box machine learning models, it's often important for explanations to have certain desirable properties. Most existing methods `encourage' desirable properties in their construction of explanations. In this work, we demonstrate that these forms of encouragement do not consistently create explanations with the properties that are supposedly being targeted. Moreover, they do not allow for any control over which properties are prioritized when different properties are at odds with each other. We propose to directly optimize explanations for desired properties. Our direct approach not only produces explanations with optimal properties more consistently but also empowers users to control trade-offs between different properties, allowing them to create explanations with exactly what is needed for a particular task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khurram Yamin, Shantanu Gupta, Gaurav R. Ghosal, Zachary C. Lipton, Bryan Wilder</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we investigate the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the representative problem of inferring causal relationships from narratives. We find that even state-of-the-art language models rely on unreliable shortcuts, both in terms of the narrative presentation and their parametric knowledge. For example, LLMs tend to determine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events (i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance whenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we demonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail when the narratives are long and contain many events. Additionally, we show LLMs appear to rely heavily on their parametric knowledge at the expense of reasoning over the provided narrative. This degrades their abilities whenever the narrative opposes parametric knowledge. We extensively validate these failure modes through carefully controlled synthetic experiments, as well as evaluations on real-world narratives. Finally, we observe that explicitly generating a causal graph generally improves performance while naive chain-of-thought is ineffective. Collectively, our results distill precise failure modes of current state-of-the-art models and can pave the way for future techniques to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Armand Kassa\"i Koupa\"i, Jorge Misfut Benet, Yuan Yin, Jean-No\"el Vittaut, Patrick Gallinari</p>
<p>Abstract: Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges for data-driven methods due to the sensitivity of spatio-temporal dynamics to variations in PDE parameters. Machine learning approaches often struggle to capture this variability. To address this, data-driven approaches learn parametric PDEs by sampling a very large variety of trajectories with varying PDE parameters. We first show that incorporating conditioning mechanisms for learning parametric PDEs is essential and that among them, $\textit{adaptive conditioning}$, allows stronger generalization. As existing adaptive conditioning methods do not scale well with respect to the number of parameters to adapt in the neural solver, we propose GEPS, a simple adaptation mechanism to boost GEneralization in Pde Solvers via a first-order optimization and low-rank rapid adaptation of a small set of context parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach for both fully data-driven and for physics-aware neural solvers. Validation performed on a whole range of spatio-temporal forecasting problems demonstrates excellent performance for generalizing to unseen conditions including initial conditions, PDE coefficients, forcing terms and solution domain. $\textit{Project page}$: https://geps-project.github.io</p>

<p>Abstract: Battery degradation remains a critical challenge in the pursuit of green technologies and sustainable energy solutions. Despite significant research efforts, predicting battery capacity loss accurately remains a formidable task due to its complex nature, influenced by both aging and cycling behaviors. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel general-purpose model for battery degradation prediction and synthesis, DiffBatt. Leveraging an innovative combination of conditional and unconditional diffusion models with classifier-free guidance and transformer architecture, DiffBatt achieves high expressivity and scalability. DiffBatt operates as a probabilistic model to capture uncertainty in aging behaviors and a generative model to simulate battery degradation. The performance of the model excels in prediction tasks while also enabling the generation of synthetic degradation curves, facilitating enhanced model training by data augmentation. In the remaining useful life prediction task, DiffBatt provides accurate results with a mean RMSE of 196 cycles across all datasets, outperforming all other models and demonstrating superior generalizability. This work represents an important step towards developing foundational models for battery degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atli Kosson, Bettina Messmer, Martin Jaggi</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning Rate Warmup is a popular heuristic for training neural networks, especially at larger batch sizes, despite limited understanding of its benefits. Warmup decreases the update size $\Delta \mathbf{w}_t = \eta_t \mathbf{u}_t$ early in training by using lower values for the learning rate $\eta_t$. In this work we argue that warmup benefits training by keeping the overall size of $\Delta \mathbf{w}_t$ limited, counteracting large initial values of $\mathbf{u}_t$. Focusing on small-scale GPT training with AdamW/Lion, we explore the following question: Why and by which criteria are early updates $\mathbf{u}_t$ too large? We analyze different metrics for the update size including the $\ell_2$-norm, resulting directional change, and impact on the representations of the network, providing a new perspective on warmup. In particular, we find that warmup helps counteract large angular updates as well as a limited critical batch size early in training. Finally, we show that the need for warmup can be significantly reduced or eliminated by modifying the optimizer to explicitly normalize $\mathbf{u}_t$ based on the aforementioned metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Hung Liu, Gleb Novikov</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a technique to design efficiently computable estimators for sparse linear regression in the simultaneous presence of two adversaries: oblivious and adaptive. We design several robust algorithms that outperform the state of the art even in the special case when oblivious adversary simply adds Gaussian noise. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability recovers the signal up to error $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ as long as the number of samples $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^2/\varepsilon)$, only assuming some bounds on the third and the fourth moments of the distribution ${D}$ of the design.
  In addition, prior to this work, even in the special case of Gaussian design and noise, no polynomial time algorithm was known to achieve error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ in the sparse setting $n < d^2$. We show that under some assumptions on the fourth and the eighth moments of ${D}$, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ as long as $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^4 / \varepsilon^3)$. For Gaussian distribution, this algorithm achieves error $O(\varepsilon^{3/4})$. Moreover, our algorithm achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for all log-concave distributions if $\varepsilon \le 1/\text{polylog(d)}$.
  Our algorithms are based on the filtering of the covariates that uses sum-of-squares relaxations, and weighted Huber loss minimization with $\ell_1$ regularizer. We provide a novel analysis of weighted penalized Huber loss that is suitable for heavy-tailed designs in the presence of two adversaries. Furthermore, we complement our algorithmic results with Statistical Query lower bounds, providing evidence that our estimators are likely to have nearly optimal sample complexity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Macroscopic observables of a system are of keen interest in real applications such as the design of novel materials. Current methods rely on microscopic trajectory simulations, where the forces on all microscopic coordinates need to be computed or measured. However, this can be computationally prohibitive for realistic systems. In this paper, we propose a method to learn macroscopic dynamics requiring only force computations on a subset of the microscopic coordinates. Our method relies on a sparsity assumption: the force on each microscopic coordinate relies only on a small number of other coordinates. The main idea of our approach is to map the training procedure on the macroscopic coordinates back to the microscopic coordinates, on which partial force computations can be used as stochastic estimation to update model parameters. We provide a theoretical justification of this under suitable conditions. We demonstrate the accuracy, force computation efficiency, and robustness of our method on learning macroscopic closure models from a variety of microscopic systems, including those modeled by partial differential equations or molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Schleich, Marta Skreta, Lasse B. Kristensen, Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hern\'andez, Al\'an Aspuru-Guzik</p>
<p>Abstract: The feasibility of variational quantum algorithms, the most popular correspondent of neural networks on noisy, near-term quantum hardware, is highly impacted by the circuit depth of the involved parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs). Higher depth increases expressivity, but also results in a detrimental accumulation of errors. Furthermore, the number of parameters involved in the PQC significantly influences the performance through the necessary number of measurements to evaluate gradients, which scales linearly with the number of parameters.
  Motivated by this, we look at deep equilibrium models (DEQs), which mimic an infinite-depth, weight-tied network using a fraction of the memory by employing a root solver to find the fixed points of the network. In this work, we present Quantum Deep Equilibrium Models (QDEQs): a training paradigm that learns parameters of a quantum machine learning model given by a PQC using DEQs. To our knowledge, no work has yet explored the application of DEQs to QML models. We apply QDEQs to find the parameters of a quantum circuit in two settings: the first involves classifying MNIST-4 digits with 4 qubits; the second extends it to 10 classes of MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR. We find that QDEQ is not only competitive with comparable existing baseline models, but also achieves higher performance than a network with 5 times more layers. This demonstrates that the QDEQ paradigm can be used to develop significantly more shallow quantum circuits for a given task, something which is essential for the utility of near-term quantum computers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rashid Barket, Uzma Shafiq, Matthew England, Juergen Gerhard</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic integration is a fundamental problem in mathematics: we consider how machine learning may be used to optimise this task in a Computer Algebra System (CAS). We train transformers that predict whether a particular integration method will be successful, and compare against the existing human-made heuristics (called guards) that perform this task in a leading CAS. We find the transformer can outperform these guards, gaining up to 30% accuracy and 70% precision. We further show that the inference time of the transformer is inconsequential which shows that it is well-suited to include as a guard in a CAS. Furthermore, we use Layer Integrated Gradients to interpret the decisions that the transformer is making. If guided by a subject-matter expert, the technique can explain some of the predictions based on the input tokens, which can lead to further optimisations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youyuan Long, Tolga Ok, Pedro Zattoni Scroccaro, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse Optimization (IO) is a framework for learning the unknown objective function of an expert decision-maker from a past dataset. In this paper, we extend the hypothesis class of IO objective functions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), thereby enhancing feature representation to an infinite-dimensional space. We demonstrate that a variant of the representer theorem holds for a specific training loss, allowing the reformulation of the problem as a finite-dimensional convex optimization program. To address scalability issues commonly associated with kernel methods, we propose the Sequential Selection Optimization (SSO) algorithm to efficiently train the proposed Kernel Inverse Optimization (KIO) model. Finally, we validate the generalization capabilities of the proposed KIO model and the effectiveness of the SSO algorithm through learning-from-demonstration tasks on the MuJoCo benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix Petersen, Christian Borgelt, Stefano Ermon</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the training of the first layer of vision models and notice the clear relationship between pixel values and gradient update magnitudes: the gradients arriving at the weights of a first layer are by definition directly proportional to (normalized) input pixel values. Thus, an image with low contrast has a smaller impact on learning than an image with higher contrast, and a very bright or very dark image has a stronger impact on the weights than an image with moderate brightness. In this work, we propose performing gradient descent on the embeddings produced by the first layer of the model. However, switching to discrete inputs with an embedding layer is not a reasonable option for vision models. Thus, we propose the conceptual procedure of (i) a gradient descent step on first layer activations to construct an activation proposal, and (ii) finding the optimal weights of the first layer, i.e., those weights which minimize the squared distance to the activation proposal. We provide a closed form solution of the procedure and adjust it for robust stochastic training while computing everything efficiently. Empirically, we find that TrAct (Training Activations) speeds up training by factors between 1.25x and 4x while requiring only a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the utility of TrAct with different optimizers for a range of different vision models including convolutional and transformer architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongjiang Shang, Ling Chen, Binqing wu, Dongliang Cui</p>
<p>Abstract: Although transformer-based methods have achieved great success in multi-scale temporal pattern interaction modeling, two key challenges limit their further development: (1) Individual time points contain less semantic information, and leveraging attention to model pair-wise interactions may cause the information utilization bottleneck. (2) Multiple inherent temporal variations (e.g., rising, falling, and fluctuating) entangled in temporal patterns. To this end, we propose Adaptive Multi-Scale Hypergraph Transformer (Ada-MSHyper) for time series forecasting. Specifically, an adaptive hypergraph learning module is designed to provide foundations for modeling group-wise interactions, then a multi-scale interaction module is introduced to promote more comprehensive pattern interactions at different scales. In addition, a node and hyperedge constraint mechanism is introduced to cluster nodes with similar semantic information and differentiate the temporal variations within each scales. Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that Ada-MSHyper achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing prediction errors by an average of 4.56%, 10.38%, and 4.97% in MSE for long-range, short-range, and ultra-long-range time series forecasting, respectively.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenjia Xie, Hao Wang, Luankang Zhang, Rui Zhou, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict items that users may be interested in based on their historical behavior sequences. We revisit SR from a novel information-theoretic perspective and find that conventional sequential modeling methods fail to adequately capture the randomness and unpredictability of user behavior. Inspired by fuzzy information processing theory, this paper introduces the DDSR model, which uses fuzzy sets of interaction sequences to overcome the limitations and better capture the evolution of users' real interests. Formally based on diffusion transition processes in discrete state spaces, which is unlike common diffusion models such as DDPM that operate in continuous domains. It is better suited for discrete data, using structured transitions instead of arbitrary noise introduction to avoid information loss. Additionally, to address the inefficiency of matrix transformations due to the vast discrete space, we use semantic labels derived from quantization or RQ-VAE to replace item IDs, enhancing efficiency and improving cold start issues. Testing on three public benchmark datasets shows that DDSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in handling SR tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Wang, Sharut Gupta, Xinyi Zhang, Sana Tonekaboni, Stefanie Jegelka, Tommi Jaakkola, Caroline Uhler</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to relate and decompose information inherent in multiple modalities. By disentangling modality-specific information from information that is shared across modalities, we can improve interpretability and robustness and enable downstream tasks such as the generation of counterfactual outcomes. Separating the two types of information is challenging since they are often deeply entangled in many real-world applications. We propose Disentangled Self-Supervised Learning (DisentangledSSL), a novel self-supervised approach for learning disentangled representations. We present a comprehensive analysis of the optimality of each disentangled representation, particularly focusing on the scenario not covered in prior work where the so-called Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) point is not attainable. We demonstrate that DisentangledSSL successfully learns shared and modality-specific features on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets and consistently outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including prediction tasks for vision-language data, as well as molecule-phenotype retrieval tasks for biological data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paulius Rauba, Nabeel Seedat, Max Ruiz Luyten, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: The predominant de facto paradigm of testing ML models relies on either using only held-out data to compute aggregate evaluation metrics or by assessing the performance on different subgroups. However, such data-only testing methods operate under the restrictive assumption that the available empirical data is the sole input for testing ML models, disregarding valuable contextual information that could guide model testing. In this paper, we challenge the go-to approach of data-only testing and introduce context-aware testing (CAT) which uses context as an inductive bias to guide the search for meaningful model failures. We instantiate the first CAT system, SMART Testing, which employs large language models to hypothesize relevant and likely failures, which are evaluated on data using a self-falsification mechanism. Through empirical evaluations in diverse settings, we show that SMART automatically identifies more relevant and impactful failures than alternatives, demonstrating the potential of CAT as a testing paradigm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giangiacomo Mercatali, Yogesh Verma, Andre Freitas, Vikas Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel score-based diffusion framework named Twigs that incorporates multiple co-evolving flows for enriching conditional generation tasks. Specifically, a central or trunk diffusion process is associated with a primary variable (e.g., graph structure), and additional offshoot or stem processes are dedicated to dependent variables (e.g., graph properties or labels). A new strategy, which we call loop guidance, effectively orchestrates the flow of information between the trunk and the stem processes during sampling. This approach allows us to uncover intricate interactions and dependencies, and unlock new generative capabilities. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate strong performance gains of the proposed method over contemporary baselines in the context of conditional graph generation, underscoring the potential of Twigs in challenging generative tasks such as inverse molecular design and molecular optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengyi Cai, Zesheng Ye, Lei Feng, Jianzhong Qi, Feng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual reprogramming (VR) leverages the intrinsic capabilities of pretrained vision models by adapting their input or output interfaces to solve downstream tasks whose labels (i.e., downstream labels) might be totally different from the labels associated with the pretrained models (i.e., pretrained labels). When adapting the output interface, label mapping methods transform the pretrained labels to downstream labels by establishing a gradient-free one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of labels. However, in this paper, we reveal that one-to-one mappings may overlook the complex relationship between pretrained and downstream labels. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Bayesian-guided Label Mapping (BLM) method. BLM constructs an iteratively-updated probabilistic label mapping matrix, with each element quantifying a pairwise relationship between pretrained and downstream labels. The assignment of values to the constructed matrix is guided by Bayesian conditional probability, considering the joint distribution of the downstream labels and the labels predicted by the pretrained model on downstream samples. Experiments conducted on both pretrained vision models (e.g., ResNeXt) and vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) demonstrate the superior performance of BLM over existing label mapping methods. The success of BLM also offers a probabilistic lens through which to understand and analyze the effectiveness of VR. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/BayesianLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhan Guo, Jiahong Deng, Yi Wei, Hui Dou, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention-based architectures have become ubiquitous in time series forecasting tasks, including spatio-temporal (STF) and long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). Yet, our understanding of the reasons for their effectiveness remains limited. This work proposes a new way to understand self-attention networks: we have shown empirically that the entire attention mechanism in the encoder can be reduced to an MLP formed by feedforward, skip-connection, and layer normalization operations for temporal and/or spatial modeling in multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, the Q, K, and V projection, the attention score calculation, the dot-product between the attention score and the V, and the final projection can be removed from the attention-based networks without significantly degrading the performance that the given network remains the top-tier compared to other SOTA methods. For spatio-temporal networks, the MLP-replace-attention network achieves a reduction in FLOPS of $62.579\%$ with a loss in performance less than $2.5\%$; for LTSF, a reduction in FLOPs of $42.233\%$ with a loss in performance less than $2\%$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fenmin Wu, Sicong Liu, Kehao Zhu, Xiaochen Li, Bin Guo, Zhiwen Yu, Hongkai Wen, Xiangrui Xu, Lehao Wang, Xiangyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of mobile devices equipped with numerous sensors, such as LiDAR and cameras, has spurred the adoption of multi-modal deep intelligence for distributed sensing tasks, such as smart cabins and driving assistance. However, the arrival times of mobile sensory data vary due to modality size and network dynamics, which can lead to delays (if waiting for slower data) or accuracy decline (if inference proceeds without waiting). Moreover, the diversity and dynamic nature of mobile systems exacerbate this challenge. In response, we present a shift to \textit{opportunistic} inference for asynchronous distributed multi-modal data, enabling inference as soon as partial data arrives. While existing methods focus on optimizing modality consistency and complementarity, known as modal affinity, they lack a \textit{computational} approach to control this affinity in open-world mobile environments. AdaFlow pioneers the formulation of structured cross-modality affinity in mobile contexts using a hierarchical analysis-based normalized matrix. This approach accommodates the diversity and dynamics of modalities, generalizing across different types and numbers of inputs. Employing an affinity attention-based conditional GAN (ACGAN), AdaFlow facilitates flexible data imputation, adapting to various modalities and downstream tasks without retraining. Experiments show that AdaFlow significantly reduces inference latency by up to 79.9\% and enhances accuracy by up to 61.9\%, outperforming status quo approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lokendra Poudel, Sushant Jha, Ryan Meeker, Duy-Nhat Phan, Rahul Bhowmik</p>
<p>Abstract: Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) employs ultrasonic welding to bond similar or dissimilar metal foils to a substrate, resulting in solid, consolidated metal components. However, certain processing conditions can lead to inter-layer defects, affecting the final product's quality. This study develops a method to monitor in-process quality using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN models were evaluated on their ability to classify samples with and without embedded thermocouples across five power levels (300W, 600W, 900W, 1200W, 1500W) using thermal images with supervised labeling. Four distinct CNN classification models were created for different scenarios including without (baseline) and with thermocouples, only without thermocouples across power levels, only with thermocouples across power levels, and combined without and with thermocouples across power levels. The models achieved 98.29% accuracy on combined baseline and thermocouple images, 97.10% for baseline images across power levels, 97.43% for thermocouple images, and 97.27% for both types across power levels. The high accuracy, above 97%, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in identifying and classifying conditions within the UAM process, providing a reliable tool for quality assurance and process control in manufacturing environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Chen, Kevin Bello, Francesco Locatello, Bryon Aragam, Pradeep Ravikumar</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the linear causal representation learning setting where we observe a linear mixing of $d$ unknown latent factors, which follow a linear structural causal model. Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments, each of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent factors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely \textit{change the entire causal graph over the latent factors}. On the flip side, we relax what we wish to extract to simply the \textit{list of nodes that have shifted between one or more environments}. We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset. The code can be found at https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiang Li, Yixiang Dai, Qing Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070">Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Quentin Guilhot, Jascha Achterberg, Micha{\l} W\'ojcik, Rui Ponte Costa</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems are increasingly popular tools in neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Measures comparing neural activations across conditions, architectures, and species give scalable ways to understand information transformation within different neural networks. However, recent findings show that some metrics respond to spurious signals, leading to misleading results. Establishing benchmark test cases is thus essential for identifying the most reliable metric and potential improvements. We propose that compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can provide a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. Implementing this case allows us to evaluate if metrics can identify representations that develop throughout learning and determine if representations identified by metrics reflect the network's actual computations. Building both attractor and RNN based test cases, we show that the recently proposed Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and reliably identifies behaviorally relevant representations compared to prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also demonstrate how such test cases can extend beyond metric evaluation to study new architectures. Specifically, testing DSA in modern (Mamba) state space models suggests that these models, unlike RNNs, may not require changes in recurrent dynamics due to their expressive hidden states. Overall, we develop test cases that showcase how DSA's enhanced ability to detect dynamical motifs makes it highly effective for identifying ongoing computations in RNNs and revealing how networks learn tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Maran, Alberto Maria Metelli, Matteo Papini, Marcello Restelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Achieving the no-regret property for Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems in continuous state and action-space environments is one of the major open problems in the field. Existing solutions either work under very specific assumptions or achieve bounds that are vacuous in some regimes. Furthermore, many structural assumptions are known to suffer from a provably unavoidable exponential dependence on the time horizon $H$ in the regret, which makes any possible solution unfeasible in practice. In this paper, we identify local linearity as the feature that makes Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) both learnable (sublinear regret) and feasible (regret that is polynomial in $H$). We define a novel MDP representation class, namely Locally Linearizable MDPs, generalizing other representation classes like Linear MDPs and MDPS with low inherent Belmman error. Then, i) we introduce Cinderella, a no-regret algorithm for this general representation class, and ii) we show that all known learnable and feasible MDP families are representable in this class. We first show that all known feasible MDPs belong to a family that we call Mildly Smooth MDPs. Then, we show how any mildly smooth MDP can be represented as a Locally Linearizable MDP by an appropriate choice of representation. This way, Cinderella is shown to achieve state-of-the-art regret bounds for all previously known (and some new) continuous MDPs for which RL is learnable and feasible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlin Lai, Daniel Sheldon, Justin Domke</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian reasoning in linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) is challenging and often requires advanced sampling techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A common approach is to write the model in a probabilistic programming language and then sample via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). However, there are many ways a user can transform a model that make inference more or less efficient. In particular, marginalizing some variables can greatly improve inference but is difficult for users to do manually. We develop an algorithm to easily marginalize random effects in LMMs. A naive approach introduces cubic time operations within an inference algorithm like HMC, but we reduce the running time to linear using fast linear algebra techniques. We show that marginalization is always beneficial when applicable and highlight improvements in various models, especially ones from cognitive sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhimanyu Das, Matthew Faw, Rajat Sen, Yichen Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Motivated by the recent success of time-series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting, we present a methodology for $\textit{in-context fine-tuning}$ of a time-series foundation model. In particular, we design a pretrained foundation model that can be prompted (at inference time) with multiple time-series examples, in order to forecast a target time-series into the future. Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time. We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models, as well as other time-series foundation models. Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nabil Omi, Hosein Hasanbeig, Hiteshi Sharma, Sriram K. Rajamani, Siddhartha Sen</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a formal, model-agnostic meta-learning framework for safe reinforcement learning. Our framework is inspired by how parents safeguard their children across a progression of increasingly riskier tasks, imparting a sense of safety that is carried over from task to task. We model this as a meta-learning process where each task is synchronized with a safeguard that monitors safety and provides a reward signal to the agent. The safeguard is implemented as a finite-state machine based on a safety specification; the reward signal is formally shaped around this specification. The safety specification and its corresponding safeguard can be arbitrarily complex and non-Markovian, which adds flexibility to the training process and explainability to the learned policy. The design of the safeguard is manual but it is high-level and model-agnostic, which gives rise to an end-to-end safe learning approach with wide applicability, from pixel-level game control to language model fine-tuning. Starting from a given set of safety specifications (tasks), we train a model such that it can adapt to new specifications using only a small number of training samples. This is made possible by our method for efficiently transferring safety bias between tasks, which effectively minimizes the number of safety violations. We evaluate our framework in a Minecraft-inspired Gridworld, a VizDoom game environment, and an LLM fine-tuning application. Agents trained with our approach achieve near-minimal safety violations, while baselines are shown to underperform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachel Longjohn, Markelle Kelly, Sameer Singh, Padhraic Smyth</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning research, it is common to evaluate algorithms via their performance on standard benchmark datasets. While a growing body of work establishes guidelines for -- and levies criticisms at -- data and benchmarking practices in machine learning, comparatively less attention has been paid to the data repositories where these datasets are stored, documented, and shared. In this paper, we analyze the landscape of these $\textit{benchmark data repositories}$ and the role they can play in improving benchmarking. This role includes addressing issues with both datasets themselves (e.g., representational harms, construct validity) and the manner in which evaluation is carried out using such datasets (e.g., overemphasis on a few datasets and metrics, lack of reproducibility). To this end, we identify and discuss a set of considerations surrounding the design and use of benchmark data repositories, with a focus on improving benchmarking practices in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nabeel Seedat, Mihaela van der Schaar</p>
<p>Abstract: Schema matching -- the task of finding matches between attributes across disparate data sources with different tables and hierarchies -- is critical for creating interoperable machine learning (ML)-ready data. Addressing this fundamental data-centric problem has wide implications, especially in domains like healthcare, finance and e-commerce -- but also has the potential to benefit ML models more generally, by increasing the data available for ML model training. However, schema matching is a challenging ML task due to structural/hierarchical and semantic heterogeneity between different schemas. Previous ML approaches to automate schema matching have either required significant labeled data for model training, which is often unrealistic or suffer from poor zero-shot performance. To this end, we propose Matchmaker - a compositional language model program for schema matching, comprised of candidate generation, refinement and confidence scoring. Matchmaker also self-improves in a zero-shot manner without the need for labeled demonstrations via a novel optimization approach, which constructs synthetic in-context demonstrations to guide the language model's reasoning process. Empirically, we demonstrate on real-world medical schema matching benchmarks that Matchmaker outperforms previous ML-based approaches, highlighting its potential to accelerate data integration and interoperability of ML-ready data.</p>

<p>Abstract: The problem of heterogeneous clients in federated learning has recently drawn a lot of attention. Spectral model sharding, i.e., partitioning the model parameters into low-rank matrices based on the singular value decomposition, has been one of the proposed solutions for more efficient on-device training in such settings. In this work, we present two sampling strategies for such sharding, obtained as solutions to specific optimization problems. The first produces unbiased estimators of the original weights, while the second aims to minimize the squared approximation error. We discuss how both of these estimators can be incorporated in the federated learning loop and practical considerations that arise during local training. Empirically, we demonstrate that both of these methods can lead to improved performance on various commonly used datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yan, Alexander G. Schwing, Yu-Xiong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Decision Transformers have recently emerged as a new and compelling paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), completing a trajectory in an autoregressive way. While improvements have been made to overcome initial shortcomings, online finetuning of decision transformers has been surprisingly under-explored. The widely adopted state-of-the-art Online Decision Transformer (ODT) still struggles when pretrained with low-reward offline data. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the online-finetuning of the decision transformer, showing that the commonly used Return-To-Go (RTG) that's far from the expected return hampers the online fine-tuning process. This problem, however, is well-addressed by the value function and advantage of standard RL algorithms. As suggested by our analysis, in our experiments, we hence find that simply adding TD3 gradients to the finetuning process of ODT effectively improves the online finetuning performance of ODT, especially if ODT is pretrained with low-reward offline data. These findings provide new directions to further improve decision transformers.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Markov decision processes (MDPs), quantile risk measures such as Value-at-Risk are a standard metric for modeling RL agents' preferences for certain outcomes. This paper proposes a new Q-learning algorithm for quantile optimization in MDPs with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The algorithm leverages a new, simple dynamic program (DP) decomposition for quantile MDPs. Compared with prior work, our DP decomposition requires neither known transition probabilities nor solving complex saddle point equations and serves as a suitable foundation for other model-free RL algorithms. Our numerical results in tabular domains show that our Q-learning algorithm converges to its DP variant and outperforms earlier algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Hoover, Duen Horng Chau, Hendrik Strobelt, Parikshit Ram, Dmitry Krotov</p>
<p>Abstract: Dense Associative Memories are high storage capacity variants of the Hopfield networks that are capable of storing a large number of memory patterns in the weights of the network of a given size. Their common formulations typically require storing each pattern in a separate set of synaptic weights, which leads to the increase of the number of synaptic weights when new patterns are introduced. In this work we propose an alternative formulation of this class of models using random features, commonly used in kernel methods. In this formulation the number of network's parameters remains fixed. At the same time, new memories can be added to the network by modifying existing weights. We show that this novel network closely approximates the energy function and dynamics of conventional Dense Associative Memories and shares their desirable computational properties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirhossein Mollaali, Gabriel Zufferey, Gonzalo Constante-Flores, Christian Moya, Can Li, Guang Lin, Meng Yue</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new data-driven methodology for predicting intervals of post-fault voltage trajectories in power systems. We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Robot learning holds tremendous promise to unlock the full potential of flexible, general, and dexterous robot systems, as well as to address some of the deepest questions in artificial intelligence. However, bringing robot learning to the level of generality required for effective real-world systems faces major obstacles in terms of data, generalization, and robustness. In this paper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models) can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robot policies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flow matching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this model can be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robot platforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobile manipulators. We evaluate our model in terms of its ability to perform tasks in zero shot after pre-training, follow language instructions from people and from a high-level VLM policy, and its ability to acquire new skills via fine-tuning. Our results cover a wide variety of tasks, such as laundry folding, table cleaning, and assembling boxes.</p>

Traditional HAR approaches often use invasive sensors like cameras or wearables, raising privacy issues. This study leverages the non-intrusive nature of CSI, using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) to interpret signal variations caused by human movements. These networks, integrated with symbolic reasoning frameworks such as DeepProbLog, enhance the adaptability and interpretability of HAR systems. SNNs offer reduced power consumption, ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate SNN-based neurosymbolic models achieve high accuracy making them a promising alternative for HAR across various domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24169">The Importance of Being Scalable: Improving the Speed and Accuracy of Neural Network Interatomic Potentials Across Chemical Domains</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Eric Qu, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling has been critical in improving model performance and generalization in machine learning. It involves how a model's performance changes with increases in model size or input data, as well as how efficiently computational resources are utilized to support this growth. Despite successes in other areas, the study of scaling in Neural Network Interatomic Potentials (NNIPs) remains limited. NNIPs act as surrogate models for ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The dominant paradigm here is to incorporate many physical domain constraints into the model, such as rotational equivariance. We contend that these complex constraints inhibit the scaling ability of NNIPs, and are likely to lead to performance plateaus in the long run. In this work, we take an alternative approach and start by systematically studying NNIP scaling strategies. Our findings indicate that scaling the model through attention mechanisms is efficient and improves model expressivity. These insights motivate us to develop an NNIP architecture designed for scalability: the Efficiently Scaled Attention Interatomic Potential (EScAIP). EScAIP leverages a multi-head self-attention formulation within graph neural networks, applying attention at the neighbor-level representations. Implemented with highly-optimized attention GPU kernels, EScAIP achieves substantial gains in efficiency--at least 10x faster inference, 5x less memory usage--compared to existing NNIPs. EScAIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of datasets including catalysts (OC20 and OC22), molecules (SPICE), and materials (MPTrj). We emphasize that our approach should be thought of as a philosophy rather than a specific model, representing a proof-of-concept for developing general-purpose NNIPs that achieve better expressivity through scaling, and continue to scale efficiently with increased computational resources and training data.</p>

We leverage common properties of existing methods and recent advances in generative models to introduce counterfactual explanations for anomaly detection. Given an input, we generate its counterfactual as a diffusion-based repair that shows what a non-anomalous version should have looked like. A key advantage of this approach is that it enables a domain-independent formal specification of explainability desiderata, offering a unified framework for generating and evaluating explanations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our anomaly explainability framework, AR-Pro, on vision (MVTec, VisA) and time-series (SWaT, WADI, HAI) anomaly datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liv Gorton</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce group crosscoders, an extension of crosscoders that systematically discover and analyse symmetrical features in neural networks. While neural networks often develop equivariant representations without explicit architectural constraints, understanding these emergent symmetries has traditionally relied on manual analysis. Group crosscoders automate this process by performing dictionary learning across transformed versions of inputs under a symmetry group. Applied to InceptionV1's mixed3b layer using the dihedral group $\mathrm{D}_{32}$, our method reveals several key insights: First, it naturally clusters features into interpretable families that correspond to previously hypothesised feature types, providing more precise separation than standard sparse autoencoders. Second, our transform block analysis enables the automatic characterisation of feature symmetries, revealing how different geometric features (such as curves versus lines) exhibit distinct patterns of invariance and equivariance. These results demonstrate that group crosscoders can provide systematic insights into how neural networks represent symmetry, offering a promising new tool for mechanistic interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy M. Cohen, Alex Damian, Ameet Talwalkar, Zico Kolter, Jason D. Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimization in deep learning remains poorly understood, even in the simple setting of deterministic (i.e. full-batch) training. A key difficulty is that much of an optimizer's behavior is implicitly determined by complex oscillatory dynamics, referred to as the "edge of stability." The main contribution of this paper is to show that an optimizer's implicit behavior can be explicitly captured by a "central flow:" a differential equation which models the time-averaged optimization trajectory. We show that these flows can empirically predict long-term optimization trajectories of generic neural networks with a high degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these flows, we reveal for the first time 1) the precise sense in which RMSProp adapts to the local loss landscape, and 2) an "acceleration via regularization" mechanism, wherein adaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards low-curvature regions in which they can take larger steps. This mechanism is key to the efficacy of these adaptive optimizers. Overall, we believe that central flows constitute a promising tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep learning architectures for supervised learning on tabular data range from simple multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to sophisticated Transformers and retrieval-augmented methods. This study highlights a major, yet so far overlooked opportunity for substantially improving tabular MLPs: namely, parameter-efficient ensembling -- a paradigm for implementing an ensemble of models as one model producing multiple predictions. We start by developing TabM -- a simple model based on MLP and our variations of BatchEnsemble (an existing technique). Then, we perform a large-scale evaluation of tabular DL architectures on public benchmarks in terms of both task performance and efficiency, which renders the landscape of tabular DL in a new light. Generally, we show that MLPs, including TabM, form a line of stronger and more practical models compared to attention- and retrieval-based architectures. In particular, we find that TabM demonstrates the best performance among tabular DL models. Lastly, we conduct an empirical analysis on the ensemble-like nature of TabM. For example, we observe that the multiple predictions of TabM are weak individually, but powerful collectively. Overall, our work brings an impactful technique to tabular DL, analyses its behaviour, and advances the performance-efficiency trade-off with TabM -- a simple and powerful baseline for researchers and practitioners.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuchen Yang, Shubham Ugare, Yifan Zhao, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed precision quantization has become an important technique for enabling the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs) on limited resource computing platforms. Traditional quantization methods have primarily concentrated on maintaining neural network accuracy, either ignoring the impact of quantization on the robustness of the network, or using only empirical techniques for improving robustness. In contrast, techniques for robustness certification, which can provide strong guarantees about the robustness of DNNs have not been used during quantization due to their high computation cost.
  This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness. ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms, to guide the search process.
  We compare ARQ with multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques on several DNN architectures commonly used in quantization studies: ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10, ResNet-50 on ImageNet, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet. We demonstrate that ARQ consistently performs better than these baselines across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. In many cases, the performance of ARQ quantized networks can reach that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Remi Genet, Hugo Inzirillo</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a new method inspired by Adam that enhances convergence speed and achieves better loss function minima. Traditional optimizers, including Adam, apply uniform or globally adjusted learning rates across neural networks without considering their architectural specifics. This architecture-agnostic approach is deeply embedded in most deep learning frameworks, where optimizers are implemented as standalone modules without direct access to the network's structural information. For instance, in popular frameworks like Keras or PyTorch, optimizers operate solely on gradients and parameters, without knowledge of layer connectivity or network topology. Our algorithm, CaAdam, explores this overlooked area by introducing connection-aware optimization through carefully designed proxies of architectural information. We propose multiple scaling methodologies that dynamically adjust learning rates based on easily accessible structural properties such as layer depth, connection counts, and gradient distributions. This approach enables more granular optimization while working within the constraints of current deep learning frameworks. Empirical evaluations on standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST) show that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy compared to standard Adam optimizer, demonstrating the potential benefits of incorporating architectural awareness in optimization strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shengjie Luo, Yixian Xu, Di He, Shuxin Zheng, Tie-Yan Liu, Liwei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The accurate prediction of geometric state evolution in complex systems is critical for advancing scientific domains such as quantum chemistry and material modeling. Traditional experimental and computational methods face challenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands, while current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision and generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge (GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial and target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve geometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge derived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric states. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target geometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition kernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB framework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more detailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we conduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve joint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the underlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error. Experimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for accurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges with improved accuracy and applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Ament, Elizabeth Santorella, David Eriksson, Ben Letham, Maximilian Balandat, Eytan Bakshy</p>
<p>Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models that are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedastic Gaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian corruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models have been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy and robustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against sparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential selection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as relevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterized such that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in the data-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust regression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weak submodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby proves approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's performance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian optimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse corruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Lin, Christopher Agia, Toki Migimatsu, Marco Pavone, Jeannette Bohg</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose Text2Motion, a language-based planning framework enabling robots to solve sequential manipulation tasks that require long-horizon reasoning. Given a natural language instruction, our framework constructs both a task- and motion-level plan that is verified to reach inferred symbolic goals. Text2Motion uses feasibility heuristics encoded in Q-functions of a library of skills to guide task planning with Large Language Models. Whereas previous language-based planners only consider the feasibility of individual skills, Text2Motion actively resolves geometric dependencies spanning skill sequences by performing geometric feasibility planning during its search. We evaluate our method on a suite of problems that require long-horizon reasoning, interpretation of abstract goals, and handling of partial affordance perception. Our experiments show that Text2Motion can solve these challenging problems with a success rate of 82%, while prior state-of-the-art language-based planning methods only achieve 13%. Text2Motion thus provides promising generalization characteristics to semantically diverse sequential manipulation tasks with geometric dependencies between skills.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayan Mitra, Isidro G\'omez-Vargas, Vasilios Zarikas</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of Supernova Ia (SNIa) distance moduli $\mu(z)$ and dark energy using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reconstruction based on LSST simulated three-year SNIa data. The ANNs employed in this study utilize genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning and Monte Carlo Dropout for predictions. Our ANN reconstruction architecture is capable of modeling both the distance moduli and their associated statistical errors given redshift values. We compare the performance of the ANN-based reconstruction with two theoretical dark energy models: $\Lambda$CDM and Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CPL). Bayesian analysis is conducted for these theoretical models using the LSST simulations and compared with observations from Pantheon and Pantheon+ SNIa real data. We demonstrate that our model-independent ANN reconstruction is consistent with both theoretical models. Performance metrics and statistical tests reveal that the ANN produces distance modulus estimates that align well with the LSST dataset and exhibit only minor discrepancies with $\Lambda$CDM and CPL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Agia, Rohan Sinha, Jingyun Yang, Zi-ang Cao, Rika Antonova, Marco Pavone, Jeannette Bohg</p>
<p>Abstract: Robot behavior policies trained via imitation learning are prone to failure under conditions that deviate from their training data. Thus, algorithms that monitor learned policies at test time and provide early warnings of failure are necessary to facilitate scalable deployment. We propose Sentinel, a runtime monitoring framework that splits the detection of failures into two complementary categories: 1) Erratic failures, which we detect using statistical measures of temporal action consistency, and 2) task progression failures, where we use Vision Language Models (VLMs) to detect when the policy confidently and consistently takes actions that do not solve the task. Our approach has two key strengths. First, because learned policies exhibit diverse failure modes, combining complementary detectors leads to significantly higher accuracy at failure detection. Second, using a statistical temporal action consistency measure ensures that we quickly detect when multimodal, generative policies exhibit erratic behavior at negligible computational cost. In contrast, we only use VLMs to detect failure modes that are less time-sensitive. We demonstrate our approach in the context of diffusion policies trained on robotic mobile manipulation domains in both simulation and the real world. By unifying temporal consistency detection and VLM runtime monitoring, Sentinel detects 18% more failures than using either of the two detectors alone and significantly outperforms baselines, thus highlighting the importance of assigning specialized detectors to complementary categories of failure.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vito Alessandro Monaco, Antonio Riva, Luca Sabbioni, Lorenzo Bisi, Edoardo Vittori, Marco Pinciroli, Michele Trapletti, Marcello Restelli</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the popularity of artificial intelligence has surged due to its widespread application in various fields. The financial sector has harnessed its advantages for multiple purposes, including the development of automated trading systems designed to interact autonomously with markets to pursue different aims. In this work, we focus on the possibility of recognizing and leveraging intraday price patterns in the Foreign Exchange market, known for its extensive liquidity and flexibility. Our approach involves the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Fitted Natural Actor-Critic. This algorithm allows the training of an agent capable of effectively trading by means of continuous actions, which enable the possibility of executing orders with variable trading sizes. This feature is instrumental to realistically model transaction costs, as they typically depend on the order size. Furthermore, it facilitates the integration of risk-averse approaches to induce the agent to adopt more conservative behavior. The proposed approaches have been empirically validated on EUR-USD historical data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> \'Isak P\'etursson, Mar\'ia \'Oskarsd\'ottir</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for predicting the distribution of asset returns using a quantile-based method with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our model is designed in two stages: the first focuses on predicting the quantiles of normalized asset returns using asset-specific features, while the second stage incorporates market data to adjust these predictions for broader economic conditions. This results in a generalized model that can be applied across various asset classes, including commodities, cryptocurrencies, as well as synthetic datasets. The predicted quantiles are then converted into full probability distributions through kernel density estimation, allowing for more precise return distribution predictions and inferencing. The LSTM model significantly outperforms a linear quantile regression baseline by 98% and a dense neural network model by over 50%, showcasing its ability to capture complex patterns in financial return distributions across both synthetic and real-world data. By using exclusively asset-class-neutral features, our model achieves robust, generalizable results.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a new way of building portfolios of cryptocurrencies that provide good diversification properties to investors. First, we seek to filter these digital assets by creating some clusters based on their path signature. The goal is to identify similar patterns in the behavior of these highly volatile assets. Once such clusters have been built, we propose "optimal" portfolios by comparing the performances of such portfolios to a universe of unfiltered digital assets. Our intuition is that clustering based on path signatures will make it easier to capture the main trends and features of a group of cryptocurrencies, and allow parsimonious portfolios that reduce excessive transaction fees.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jilan Samiuddin, Benoit Boulet, Di Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory prediction module in an autonomous driving system is crucial for the decision-making and safety of the autonomous agent car and its surroundings. This work presents a novel scheme called AiGem (Agent-Interaction Graph Embedding) to predict traffic vehicle trajectories around the autonomous car. AiGem tackles this problem in four steps. First, AiGem formulates the historical traffic interaction with the autonomous agent as a graph in two steps: (1) at each time step of the history frames, agent-interactions are captured using spatial edges between the agents (nodes of the graph), and then, (2) connects the spatial graphs in chronological order using temporal edges. Then, AiGem applies a depthwise graph encoder network on the spatial-temporal graph to generate graph embedding, i.e., embedding of all the nodes in the graph. Next, a sequential Gated Recurrent Unit decoder network uses the embedding of the current timestamp to get the decoded states. Finally, an output network comprising a Multilayer Perceptron is used to predict the trajectories utilizing the decoded states as its inputs. Results show that AiGem outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for longer prediction horizons.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donald Loveland, Xinyi Wu, Tong Zhao, Danai Koutra, Neil Shah, Mingxuan Ju</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods dominate real-world recommender systems given their ability to learn high-quality, sparse ID-embedding tables that effectively capture user preferences. These tables scale linearly with the number of users and items, and are trained to ensure high similarity between embeddings of interacted user-item pairs, while maintaining low similarity for non-interacted pairs. Despite their high performance, encouraging dispersion for non-interacted pairs necessitates expensive regularization (e.g., negative sampling), hurting runtime and scalability. Existing research tends to address these challenges by simplifying the learning process, either by reducing model complexity or sampling data, trading performance for runtime. In this work, we move beyond model-level modifications and study the properties of the embedding tables under different learning strategies. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the singular values of the embedding tables are intrinsically linked to different CF loss functions. These findings are empirically validated on real-world datasets, demonstrating the practical benefits of higher stable rank, a continuous version of matrix rank which encodes the distribution of singular values. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient warm-start strategy that regularizes the stable rank of the user and item embeddings. We show that stable rank regularization during early training phases can promote higher-quality embeddings, resulting in training speed improvements of up to 66%. Additionally, stable rank regularization can act as a proxy for negative sampling, allowing for performance gains of up to 21% over loss functions with small negative sampling ratios. Overall, our analysis unifies current CF methods under a new perspective, their optimization of stable rank, motivating a flexible regularization method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Omer Nacar, Mohamed Abdelkader, Lahouari Ghouti, Kahled Gabr, Abdulrahman S. Al-Batati, Anis Koubaa</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of real-time 3D trajectory prediction for UAVs, which is critical for applications such as aerial surveillance and defense. Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000 trajectories dataset and a ROS 2 package to facilitate the integration with existing ROS-based UAV systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) into healthcare systems has significantly enhanced patient care but has also introduced critical cybersecurity challenges. This paper presents a novel approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting cyberattacks within IoMT environments. Unlike previous studies that predominantly utilized traditional machine learning (ML) models or simpler Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the proposed model leverages the capabilities of CNNs to effectively analyze the temporal characteristics of network traffic data. Trained and evaluated on the CICIoMT2024 dataset, which comprises 18 distinct types of cyberattacks across a range of IoMT devices, the proposed CNN model demonstrates superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving a perfect accuracy of 99% in binary, categorical, and multiclass classification tasks. This performance surpasses that of conventional ML models such as Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, DNNs, and Random Forests. These findings highlight the potential of CNNs to substantially improve IoMT cybersecurity, thereby ensuring the protection and integrity of connected healthcare systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study systematically analyzes the vulnerability of 36 large language models (LLMs) to various prompt injection attacks, a technique that leverages carefully crafted prompts to elicit malicious LLM behavior. Across 144 prompt injection tests, we observed a strong correlation between model parameters and vulnerability, with statistical analyses, such as logistic regression and random forest feature analysis, indicating that parameter size and architecture significantly influence susceptibility. Results revealed that 56 percent of tests led to successful prompt injections, emphasizing widespread vulnerability across various parameter sizes, with clustering analysis identifying distinct vulnerability profiles associated with specific model configurations. Additionally, our analysis uncovered correlations between certain prompt injection techniques, suggesting potential overlaps in vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust, multi-layered defenses in LLMs deployed across critical infrastructure and sensitive industries. Successful prompt injection attacks could result in severe consequences, including data breaches, unauthorized access, or misinformation. Future research should explore multilingual and multi-step defenses alongside adaptive mitigation strategies to strengthen LLM security in diverse, real-world environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: The field of quantum machine learning is a promising way to lead to a revolution in intelligent data processing methods. In this way, a hybrid learning method based on classic kernel methods is proposed. This proposal also requires the development of a quantum algorithm for the calculation of internal products between vectors of continuous values. In order for this to be possible, it was necessary to make adaptations to the classic kernel method, since it is necessary to consider the limitations imposed by the Hilbert space of the quantum processor. As a test case, we applied this new algorithm to learn to classify whether new points generated randomly, in a finite square located under a plane, were found inside or outside a circle located inside this square. It was found that the algorithm was able to correctly detect new points in 99% of the samples tested, with a small difference due to considering the radius slightly larger than the ideal. However, the kernel method was able to perform classifications correctly, as well as the internal product algorithm successfully performed the internal product calculations using quantum resources. Thus, the present work represents a contribution to the area, proposing a new model of machine learning accessible to both physicists and computer scientists.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a time-efficient approach to quantitative MRI, enabling the mapping of multiple tissue properties from a single, accelerated scan. However, achieving accurate reconstructions remains challenging, particularly in highly accelerated and undersampled acquisitions, which are crucial for reducing scan times. While deep learning techniques have advanced image reconstruction, the recent introduction of diffusion models offers new possibilities for imaging tasks, though their application in the medical field is still emerging. Notably, diffusion models have not yet been explored for the MRF problem. In this work, we propose for the first time a conditional diffusion probabilistic model for MRF image reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons on in-vivo brain scan data demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform established deep learning and compressed sensing algorithms for MRF reconstruction. Extensive ablation studies also explore strategies to improve computational efficiency of our approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing atomic models from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps is a crucial yet intricate task in structural biology. While advancements in deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), have spurred the development of sophisticated map-to-model tools like DeepTracer and ModelAngelo, their efficacy notably diminishes with low-resolution maps beyond 4 {\AA}. To address this shortfall, our research introduces DeepTracer-LowResEnhance, an innovative framework that synergizes a deep learning-enhanced map refinement technique with the power of AlphaFold. This methodology is designed to markedly improve the construction of models from low-resolution cryo-EM maps. DeepTracer-LowResEnhance was rigorously tested on a set of 37 protein cryo-EM maps, with resolutions ranging between 2.5 to 8.4 {\AA}, including 22 maps with resolutions lower than 4 {\AA}. The outcomes were compelling, demonstrating that 95.5\% of the low-resolution maps exhibited a significant uptick in the count of total predicted residues. This denotes a pronounced improvement in atomic model building for low-resolution maps. Additionally, a comparative analysis alongside Phenix's auto-sharpening functionality delineates DeepTracer-LowResEnhance's superior capability in rendering more detailed and precise atomic models, thereby pushing the boundaries of current computational structural biology methodologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: \textit{de novo} molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community.

<p>Abstract: Phenology, the timing of cyclical plant life events such as leaf emergence and coloration, is crucial in the bio-climatic system. Climate change drives shifts in these phenological events, impacting ecosystems and the climate itself. Accurate phenology models are essential to predict the occurrence of these phases under changing climatic conditions. Existing methods include hypothesis-driven process models and data-driven statistical approaches. Process models account for dormancy stages and various phenology drivers, while statistical models typically rely on linear or traditional machine learning techniques. Research shows that process models often outperform statistical methods when predicting under climate conditions outside historical ranges, especially with climate change scenarios. However, deep learning approaches remain underexplored in climate phenology modeling. We introduce PhenoFormer, a neural architecture better suited than traditional statistical methods at predicting phenology under shift in climate data distribution, while also bringing significant improvements or performing on par to the best performing process-based models. Our numerical experiments on a 70-year dataset of 70,000 phenological observations from 9 woody species in Switzerland show that PhenoFormer outperforms traditional machine learning methods by an average of 13% R2 and 1.1 days RMSE for spring phenology, and 11% R2 and 0.7 days RMSE for autumn phenology, while matching or exceeding the best process-based models. Our results demonstrate that deep learning has the potential to be a valuable methodological tool for accurate climate-phenology prediction, and our PhenoFormer is a first promising step in improving phenological predictions before a complete understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms is available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Yang, Lisen Dai, Zheyuan Liu, Xiangqi Wang, Meng Jiang, Yapeng Tian, Xiangliang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) has gained significant attention as a means to remove specific data from trained models without requiring a full retraining process. While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zhu, Yixiong Chen, Mingyu Ding, Ping Luo, Leye Wang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion has attracted vast attention due to its impressive image-generation capabilities. However, when it comes to human-centric text-to-image generation, particularly in the context of faces and hands, the results often fall short of naturalness due to insufficient training priors. We alleviate the issue in this work from two perspectives. 1) From the data aspect, we carefully collect a human-centric dataset comprising over one million high-quality human-in-the-scene images and two specific sets of close-up images of faces and hands. These datasets collectively provide a rich prior knowledge base to enhance the human-centric image generation capabilities of the diffusion model. 2) On the methodological front, we propose a simple yet effective method called Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) by considering low-rank modules trained on close-up hand and face images respectively as experts. This concept draws inspiration from our observation of low-rank refinement, where a low-rank module trained by a customized close-up dataset has the potential to enhance the corresponding image part when applied at an appropriate scale. To validate the superiority of MoLE in the context of human-centric image generation compared to state-of-the-art, we construct two benchmarks and perform evaluations with diverse metrics and human studies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keiya Hirashima, Kana Moriwaki, Michiko S. Fujii, Yutaka Hirai, Takayuki R. Saitoh, Junnichiro Makino, Ulrich P. Steinwandel, Shirley Ho</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of about 8 solar masses and above explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback present significant bottlenecks in star-by-star galaxy simulations that aim to capture individual stellar dynamics and the inhomogeneous shell expansion of SNe within the turbulent ISM. Our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Axel Klawonn, Martin Lanser, Janine Weber</p>
<p>Abstract: In many modern computer application problems, the classification of image data plays an important role. Among many different supervised machine learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as well as sophisticated variants thereof are popular techniques. In this work, two different domain decomposed CNN models are experimentally compared for different image classification problems. Both models are loosely inspired by domain decomposition methods and in addition, combined with a transfer learning strategy. The resulting models show improved classification accuracies compared to the corresponding, composed global CNN model without transfer learning and besides, also help to speed up the training process. Moreover, a novel decomposed LDA strategy is proposed which also relies on a localization approach and which is combined with a small neural network model. In comparison with a global LDA applied to the entire input data, the presented decomposed LDA approach shows increased classification accuracies for the considered test problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Carrasco, Gonzalo Mu\~noz</p>
<p>Abstract: The non-convex nature of trained neural networks has created significant obstacles in their incorporation into optimization models. Considering the wide array of applications that this embedding has, the optimization and deep learning communities have dedicated significant efforts to the convexification of trained neural networks. Many approaches to date have considered obtaining convex relaxations for each non-linear activation in isolation, which poses limitations in the tightness of the relaxations. Anderson et al. (2020) strengthened these relaxations and provided a framework to obtain the convex hull of the graph of a piecewise linear convex activation composed with an affine function; this effectively convexifies activations such as the ReLU together with the affine transformation that precedes it. In this article, we contribute to this line of work by developing a recursive formula that yields a tight convexification for the composition of an activation with an affine function for a wide scope of activation functions, namely, convex or ``S-shaped". Our approach can be used to efficiently compute separating hyperplanes or determine that none exists in various settings, including non-polyhedral cases. We provide computational experiments to test the empirical benefits of these convex approximations.</p>

We propose, test, and implement a neuron model that works with continuous values in a quantum computer.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raquel Fern\'andez-Mart\'in, Alfonso Gij\'on, Odile Feys, Elodie Juven\'e, Alec Aeby, Charline Urbain, Xavier De Ti\`ege, Vincent Wens</p>
<p>Abstract: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allows the non-invasive detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Clinical MEG analysis in epileptic patients traditionally relies on the visual identification of IEDs, which is time consuming and partially subjective. Automatic, data-driven detection methods exist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with its ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG practice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful supervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with temporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals inspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal and spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with frequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance metrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning from spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our handling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse engineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of IEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also showed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical patients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work is needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients. This study paves the way of incorporating STIED and DL algorithms into the routine clinical MEG evaluation of epilepsy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mostafa Rezapour, Aarthi Narayanan, Wyatt H. Mowery, Metin Nafi Gurcan</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluates the concordance between RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and NanoString technologies for gene expression analysis in non-human primates (NHPs) infected with Ebola virus (EBOV). We performed a detailed comparison of both platforms, demonstrating a strong correlation between them, with Spearman coefficients for 56 out of 62 samples ranging from 0.78 to 0.88, with a mean of 0.83 and a median of 0.85. Bland-Altman analysis further confirmed high consistency, with most measurements falling within 95% confidence limits. A machine learning approach, using the Supervised Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (SMAS) method trained on NanoString data, identified OAS1 as a key marker for distinguishing RT-qPCR positive from negative samples. Remarkably, when applied to RNA-Seq data, OAS1 also achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating infected from uninfected samples using logistic regression, demonstrating its robustness across platforms. Further differential expression analysis identified 12 common genes including ISG15, OAS1, IFI44, IFI27, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI44L, MX1, MX2, OAS2, RSAD2, and OASL which demonstrated the highest levels of statistical significance and biological relevance across both platforms. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis confirmed that these genes are directly involved in key immune and viral infection pathways, reinforcing their importance in EBOV infection. In addition, RNA-Seq uniquely identified genes such as CASP5, USP18, and DDX60, which play key roles in immune regulation and antiviral defense. This finding highlights the broader detection capabilities of RNA-Seq and underscores the complementary strengths of both platforms in providing a comprehensive and accurate assessment of gene expression changes during Ebola virus infection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinay Koshy, Frederick Choi, Yi-Shyuan Chiang, Hari Sundaram, Eshwar Chandrasekharan, Karrie Karahalios</p>
<p>Abstract: Research into community content moderation often assumes that moderation teams govern with a single, unified voice. However, recent work has found that moderators disagree with one another at modest, but concerning rates. The problem is not the root disagreements themselves. Subjectivity in moderation is unavoidable, and there are clear benefits to including diverse perspectives within a moderation team. Instead, the crux of the issue is that, due to resource constraints, moderation decisions end up being made by individual decision-makers. The result is decision-making that is inconsistent, which is frustrating for community members. To address this, we develop Venire, an ML-backed system for panel review on Reddit. Venire uses a machine learning model trained on log data to identify the cases where moderators are most likely to disagree. Venire fast-tracks these cases for multi-person review. Ideally, Venire allows moderators to surface and resolve disagreements that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. We conduct three studies through which we design and evaluate Venire: a set of formative interviews with moderators, technical evaluations on two datasets, and a think-aloud study in which moderators used Venire to make decisions on real moderation cases. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that Venire is able to improve decision consistency and surface latent disagreements. Qualitatively, we find that Venire helps moderators resolve difficult moderation cases more confidently. Venire represents a novel paradigm for human-AI content moderation, and shifts the conversation from replacing human decision-making to supporting it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu, Bowen Shi, Avi Caciularu, Idan Szpektor, Arman Cohan</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-document (MD) processing is crucial for LLMs to handle real-world tasks such as summarization and question-answering across large sets of documents. While LLMs have improved at processing long inputs, MD contexts still present challenges, such as managing inter-document dependencies, redundancy, and incoherent structures. We introduce MDCure, a scalable and effective fine-tuning pipeline to enhance the MD capabilities of LLMs without the computational cost of pre-training or reliance on human annotated data. MDCure is based on generation of high-quality synthetic MD instruction data from sets of related articles via targeted prompts. We further introduce MDCureRM, a multi-objective reward model which filters generated data based on their training utility for MD settings. With MDCure, we fine-tune a variety of LLMs, from the FlanT5, Qwen2, and LLAMA3.1 model families, up to 70B parameters in size. Extensive evaluations on a wide range of MD and long-context benchmarks spanning various tasks show MDCure consistently improves performance over pre-trained baselines and over corresponding base models by up to 75.5%.

<p>Abstract: There is an urgent need to identify both short and long-term risks from newly emerging types of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as available risk management measures. In response, and to support global efforts in regulating AI and writing safety standards, we compile an extensive catalog of risk sources and risk management measures for general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems, complete with descriptions and supporting examples where relevant. This work involves identifying technical, operational, and societal risks across model development, training, and deployment stages, as well as surveying established and experimental methods for managing these risks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to provide extensive documentation of both GPAI risk sources and risk management measures that are descriptive, self-contained and neutral with respect to any existing regulatory framework. This work intends to help AI providers, standards experts, researchers, policymakers, and regulators in identifying and mitigating systemic risks from GPAI systems. For this reason, the catalog is released under a public domain license for ease of direct use by stakeholders in AI governance and standards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Drenkow, Chris Ribaudo, Mathias Unberath</p>
<p>Abstract: Robustness audits of deep neural networks (DNN) provide a means to uncover model sensitivities to the challenging real-world imaging conditions that significantly degrade DNN performance in-the-wild. Such conditions are often the result of the compounding of multiple factors inherent to the environment, sensor, or processing pipeline and may lead to complex image distortions that are not easily categorized. When robustness audits are limited to a set of pre-determined imaging effects or distortions, the results cannot be (easily) transferred to real-world conditions where image corruptions may be more complex or nuanced. To address this challenge, we present a new alternative robustness auditing method that uses causal inference to measure DNN sensitivities to the factors of the imaging process that cause complex distortions. Our approach uses causal models to explicitly encode assumptions about the domain-relevant factors and their interactions. Then, through extensive experiments on natural and rendered images across multiple vision tasks, we show that our approach reliably estimates causal effects of each factor on DNN performance using observational domain data. These causal effects directly tie DNN sensitivities to observable properties of the imaging pipeline in the domain of interest towards reducing the risk of unexpected DNN failures when deployed in that domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Marconato, S\'ebastien Lachapelle, Sebastian Weichwald, Luigi Gresele</p>
<p>Abstract: We analyze identifiability as a possible explanation for the ubiquity of linear properties across language models, such as the vector difference between the representations of "easy" and "easiest" being parallel to that between "lucky" and "luckiest". For this, we ask whether finding a linear property in one model implies that any model that induces the same distribution has that property, too. To answer that, we first prove an identifiability result to characterize distribution-equivalent next-token predictors, lifting a diversity requirement of previous results. Second, based on a refinement of relational linearity [Paccanaro and Hinton, 2001; Hernandez et al., 2024], we show how many notions of linearity are amenable to our analysis. Finally, we show that under suitable conditions, these linear properties either hold in all or none distribution-equivalent next-token predictors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tanmay Parekh, Pradyot Prakash, Alexander Radovic, Akshay Shekher, Denis Savenkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Research has shown the effectiveness of reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought), planning (e.g., SelfAsk), and retrieval augmented generation strategies to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various tasks, such as question answering. However, using a single fixed strategy to answer different kinds of questions is suboptimal in performance and inefficient in terms of generated output tokens and performed retrievals. In our work, we propose a novel technique DyPlan, to induce a dynamic strategy selection process in LLMs, to improve performance and reduce costs in question-answering. DyPlan incorporates an initial decision step to select the most suitable strategy conditioned on the input question and guides the LLM's response generation accordingly. We extend DyPlan to DyPlan-verify, adding an internal verification and correction process to further enrich the generated answer. Experiments on three prominent multi-hop question answering (MHQA) datasets reveal how DyPlan can improve model performance by 7-13% while reducing the cost by 11-32% relative to the best baseline model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lintao Ye, Zhengmiao Wang, Zhi-Wei Liu, Ming Chi, Xiaoling Wang, Housheng Su</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of online convex optimization with memory and predictions over a horizon $T$. At each time step, a decision maker is given some limited predictions of the cost functions from a finite window of future time steps, i.e., values of the cost function at certain decision points in the future. The decision maker then chooses an action and incurs a cost given by a convex function that depends on the actions chosen in the past. We propose an algorithm to solve this problem and show that the dynamic regret of the algorithm decays exponentially with the prediction window length. Our algorithm contains two general subroutines that work for wider classes of problems. The first subroutine can solve general online convex optimization with memory and bandit feedback with $\sqrt{T}$-dynamic regret with respect to $T$. The second subroutine is a zeroth-order method that can be used to solve general convex optimization problems with a linear convergence rate that matches the best achievable rate of first-order methods for convex optimization. The key to our algorithm design and analysis is the use of truncated Gaussian smoothing when querying the decision points for obtaining the predictions. We complement our theoretical results using numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farshad Noravesh</p>
<p>Abstract: State-of-the-art models for relation extraction (RE) in the biomedical domain consider finetuning BioBERT using classification, but they may suffer from the anisotropy problem. Contrastive learning methods can reduce this anisotropy phenomena, and also help to avoid class collapse in any classification problem. In the present paper, a new training method called biological non-contrastive relation extraction (BioNCERE) is introduced for relation extraction without using any named entity labels for training to reduce annotation costs. BioNCERE uses transfer learning and non-contrastive learning to avoid full or dimensional collapse as well as bypass overfitting. It resolves RE in three stages by leveraging transfer learning two times. By freezing the weights learned in previous stages in the proposed pipeline and by leveraging non-contrastive learning in the second stage, the model predicts relations without any knowledge of named entities. Experiments have been done on SemMedDB that are almost similar to State-of-the-art performance on RE without using the information of named entities.</p>

<p>Abstract: The success of machine learning models relies heavily on effectively representing high-dimensional data. However, ensuring data representations capture human-understandable concepts remains difficult, often requiring the incorporation of prior knowledge and decomposition of data into multiple subspaces. Traditional linear methods fall short in modeling more than one space, while more expressive deep learning approaches lack interpretability. Here, we introduce Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis ($\texttt{sisPCA}$), a PCA extension designed for multi-subspace learning. Leveraging the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), $\texttt{sisPCA}$ incorporates supervision and simultaneously ensures subspace disentanglement. We demonstrate $\texttt{sisPCA}$'s connections with autoencoders and regularized linear regression and showcase its ability to identify and separate hidden data structures through extensive applications, including breast cancer diagnosis from image features, learning aging-associated DNA methylation changes, and single-cell analysis of malaria infection. Our results reveal distinct functional pathways associated with malaria colonization, underscoring the essentiality of explainable representation in high-dimensional data analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose the \textit{linear barycentric coding model (LBCM)} that utilizes the linear optimal transport (LOT) metric for analysis and synthesis of probability measures. We provide a closed-form solution to the variational problem characterizing the probability measures in the LBCM and establish equivalence of the LBCM to the set of Wasserstein-2 barycenters in the special case of compatible measures. Computational methods for synthesizing and analyzing measures in the LBCM are developed with finite sample guarantees. One of our main theoretical contributions is to identify an LBCM, expressed in terms of a simple family, which is sufficient to express all probability measures on the interval $[0,1]$. We show that a natural analogous construction of an LBCM in $\mathbb{R}^2$ fails, and we leave it as an open problem to identify the proper extension in more than one dimension. We conclude by demonstrating the utility of LBCM for covariance estimation and data imputation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the widespread success of Transformers across various domains, their optimization guarantees in large-scale model settings are not well-understood. This paper rigorously analyzes the convergence properties of gradient flow in training Transformers with weight decay regularization. First, we construct the mean-field limit of large-scale Transformers, showing that as the model width and depth go to infinity, gradient flow converges to the Wasserstein gradient flow, which is represented by a partial differential equation. Then, we demonstrate that the gradient flow reaches a global minimum consistent with the PDE solution when the weight decay regularization parameter is sufficiently small. Our analysis is based on a series of novel mean-field techniques that adapt to Transformers. Compared with existing tools for deep networks (Lu et al., 2020) that demand homogeneity and global Lipschitz smoothness, we utilize a refined analysis assuming only $\textit{partial homogeneity}$ and $\textit{local Lipschitz smoothness}$. These new techniques may be of independent interest.</p>

Participants were randomly assigned to two groups, and crossed over between coding complex (longer) texts versus simple (shorter) texts, while using our tool versus not using our tool. \textbf{Results} Based on Mann-Whitney U test, the median coding time difference for complex clinical text sequences was 123 seconds (\emph{P}\textless.001, 95\% CI: 81 to 164), representing a 46\% reduction in median coding time when our tool is used. There was no significant time difference for simpler text sequences. For coding accuracy, the improvement we noted for both complex and simple texts was not significant. \textbf{Conclusions} This study demonstrates the potential of AI to transform common tasks in clinical workflows, with ostensible positive impacts on work efficiencies for complex clinical coding tasks. Further studies within hospital workflows are required before these presumed impacts can be more clearly understood.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Debangshu Banerjee, Aditya Gopalan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences have benefited from larger reward models and better preference data. However, most of these methodologies rely on the accuracy of the reward model. The reward models used in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) are typically learned from small datasets using stochastic optimization algorithms, making them prone to high variability. We illustrate the inconsistencies between reward models empirically on numerous open-source datasets.
  We theoretically show that the fluctuation of the reward models can be detrimental to the alignment problem because the derived policies are more overfitted to the reward model and, hence, are riskier if the reward model itself is uncertain. We use concentration of measure to motivate an uncertainty-aware, conservative algorithm for policy optimization. We show that such policies are more risk-averse in the sense that they are more cautious of uncertain rewards. We theoretically prove that our proposed methodology has less risk than the vanilla method.
  We corroborate our theoretical results with experiments based on designing an ensemble of reward models. We use this ensemble of reward models to align a language model using our methodology and observe that our empirical findings match our theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Li, Yanhong Li, Tianyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs), through the lens of gradient, when training with different responses and initial models. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Moreover, pre-trained LLMs are less affected by the instability of fast thinking than instruction-tuned LLMs. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent.

<p><b>Authors:</b> S Balasubramanian, M Sai Subramaniam, Sai Sriram Talasu, P Yedu Krishna, Manepalli Pranav Phanindra Sai, Ravi Mukkamala, Darshan Gera</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNS) excel at learning from static datasets but struggle with continual learning, where data arrives sequentially. Catastrophic forgetting, the phenomenon of forgetting previously learned knowledge, is a primary challenge. This paper introduces EXponentially Averaged Class-wise Feature Significance (EXACFS) to mitigate this issue in the class incremental learning (CIL) setting. By estimating the significance of model features for each learned class using loss gradients, gradually aging the significance through the incremental tasks and preserving the significant features through a distillation loss, EXACFS effectively balances remembering old knowledge (stability) and learning new knowledge (plasticity). Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 demonstrate EXACFS's superior performance in preserving stability while acquiring plasticity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhe Fang, Yifei Wang, Zhaoyang Liu, Chenheng Zhang, Stefanie Jegelka, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling long-context inputs is crucial for large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as extended conversations, document summarization, and many-shot in-context learning. While recent approaches have extended the context windows of LLMs and employed perplexity (PPL) as a standard evaluation metric, PPL has proven unreliable for assessing long-context capabilities. The underlying cause of this limitation has remained unclear. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation for this issue. We find that PPL overlooks key tokens, which are essential for long-context understanding, by averaging across all tokens and thereby obscuring the true performance of models in long-context scenarios. To address this, we propose \textbf{LongPPL}, a novel metric that focuses on key tokens by employing a long-short context contrastive method to identify them. Our experiments demonstrate that LongPPL strongly correlates with performance on various long-context benchmarks (e.g., Pearson correlation of -0.96), significantly outperforming traditional PPL in predictive accuracy. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{LongCE} (Long-context Cross-Entropy) loss, a re-weighting strategy for fine-tuning that prioritizes key tokens, leading to consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. In summary, these contributions offer deeper insights into the limitations of PPL and present effective solutions for accurately evaluating and enhancing the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongPPL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mirco Giacobbe, Daniel Kroening, Abhinandan Pal, Michael Tautschnig</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a machine learning approach to model checking temporal logic, with application to formal hardware verification. Model checking answers the question of whether every execution of a given system satisfies a desired temporal logic specification. Unlike testing, model checking provides formal guarantees. Its application is expected standard in silicon design and the EDA industry has invested decades into the development of performant symbolic model checking algorithms. Our new approach combines machine learning and symbolic reasoning by using neural networks as formal proof certificates for linear temporal logic. We train our neural certificates from randomly generated executions of the system and we then symbolically check their validity using satisfiability solving which, upon the affirmative answer, establishes that the system provably satisfies the specification. We leverage the expressive power of neural networks to represent proof certificates as well as the fact that checking a certificate is much simpler than finding one. As a result, our machine learning procedure for model checking is entirely unsupervised, formally sound, and practically effective. We experimentally demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art academic and commercial model checkers on a set of standard hardware designs written in SystemVerilog.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Edyta Brzychczy, Tomasz Pe{\l}ech-Pilichowski, Ziemowit Dworakowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Process mining gains increasing popularity in business process analysis, also in heavy industry. It requires a specific data format called an event log, with the basic structure including a case identifier (case ID), activity (event) name, and timestamp. In the case of industrial processes, data is very often provided by a monitoring system as time series of low level sensor readings. This data cannot be directly used for process mining since there is no explicit marking of activities in the event log, and sometimes, case ID is not provided. We propose a novel rule-based algorithm for identification patterns, based on the identification of significant changes in short-term mean values of selected variable to detect case ID. We present our solution on the mining use case. We compare computed results (identified patterns) with expert labels of the same dataset. Experiments show that the developed algorithm in the most of the cases correctly detects IDs in datasets with and without outliers reaching F1 score values: 96.8% and 97% respectively. We also evaluate our algorithm on dataset from manufacturing domain reaching value 92.6% for F1 score.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Li, Minghui Zhang, Chuyan Zhang, Yun Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate airway anatomical labeling is crucial for clinicians to identify and navigate complex bronchial structures during bronchoscopy. Automatic airway anatomical labeling is challenging due to significant individual variability and anatomical variations. Previous methods are prone to generate inconsistent predictions, which is harmful for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel method that enhances topological consistency and improves the detection of abnormal airway branches.
  We propose a novel approach incorporating two modules: the Soft Subtree Consistency (SSC) and the Abnormal Branch Saliency (ABS). The SSC module constructs a soft subtree to capture clinically relevant topological relationships, allowing for flexible feature aggregation within and across subtrees. The ABS module facilitates the interaction between node features and prototypes to distinguish abnormal branches, preventing the erroneous aggregation of features between normal and abnormal nodes.
  Evaluated on a challenging dataset characterized by severe airway distortion and atrophy, our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, it attains a 91.4% accuracy at the segmental level and an 83.7% accuracy at the subsegmental level, representing a 1.4% increase in subsegmental accuracy and a 3.1% increase in topological consistency. Notably, the method demonstrates reliable performance in cases with disease-induced airway deformities, ensuring consistent and accurate labeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanke Zhou, Rong Tao, Jianing Zhu, Yiwen Luo, Zengmao Wang, Bo Han</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models (LLMs): chain-of-thought prompting with noisy rationales, which include irrelevant or inaccurate reasoning thoughts within examples used for in-context learning. We construct NoRa dataset that is tailored to evaluate the robustness of reasoning in the presence of noisy rationales. Our findings on NoRa dataset reveal a prevalent vulnerability to such noise among current LLMs, with existing robust methods like self-correction and self-consistency showing limited efficacy. Notably, compared to prompting with clean rationales, base LLM drops by 1.4%-19.8% in accuracy with irrelevant thoughts and more drastically by 2.2%-40.4% with inaccurate thoughts.
  Addressing this challenge necessitates external supervision that should be accessible in practice. Here, we propose the method of contrastive denoising with noisy chain-of-thought (CD-CoT). It enhances LLMs' denoising-reasoning capabilities by contrasting noisy rationales with only one clean rationale, which can be the minimal requirement for denoising-purpose prompting. This method follows a principle of exploration and exploitation: (1) rephrasing and selecting rationales in the input space to achieve explicit denoising and (2) exploring diverse reasoning paths and voting on answers in the output space. Empirically, CD-CoT demonstrates an average improvement of 17.8% in accuracy over the base model and shows significantly stronger denoising capabilities than baseline methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Bakos, Pooria Madani, Heidar Davoudi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study investigates a counterintuitive phenomenon in adversarial machine learning: the potential for noise-based defenses to inadvertently aid evasion attacks in certain scenarios. While randomness is often employed as a defensive strategy against adversarial examples, our research reveals that this approach can sometimes backfire, particularly when facing adaptive attackers using reinforcement learning (RL). Our findings show that in specific cases, especially with visually noisy classes, the introduction of noise in the classifier's confidence values can be exploited by the RL attacker, leading to a significant increase in evasion success rates. In some instances, the noise-based defense scenario outperformed other strategies by up to 20\% on a subset of classes. However, this effect was not consistent across all classifiers tested, highlighting the complexity of the interaction between noise-based defenses and different models. These results suggest that in some cases, noise-based defenses can inadvertently create an adversarial training loop beneficial to the RL attacker. Our study emphasizes the need for a more nuanced approach to defensive strategies in adversarial machine learning, particularly in safety-critical applications. It challenges the assumption that randomness universally enhances defense against evasion attacks and highlights the importance of considering adaptive, RL-based attackers when designing robust defense mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel May, Alessandro Tundo, Shashikant Ilager, Ivona Brandic</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of ML models on edge devices is challenged by limited computational resources and energy availability. While split computing enables the decomposition of large neural networks (NNs) and allows partial computation on both edge and cloud devices, identifying the most suitable split layer and hardware configurations is a non-trivial task. This process is in fact hindered by the large configuration space, the non-linear dependencies between software and hardware parameters, the heterogeneous hardware and energy characteristics, and the dynamic workload conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose DynaSplit, a two-phase framework that dynamically configures parameters across both software (i.e., split layer) and hardware (e.g., accelerator usage, CPU frequency). During the Offline Phase, we solve a multi-objective optimization problem with a meta-heuristic approach to discover optimal settings. During the Online Phase, a scheduling algorithm identifies the most suitable settings for an incoming inference request and configures the system accordingly. We evaluate DynaSplit using popular pre-trained NNs on a real-world testbed. Experimental results show a reduction in energy consumption up to 72% compared to cloud-only computation, while meeting ~90% of user request's latency threshold compared to baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in multimodal contexts is essential for identifying deviations in combined inputs from different modalities, particularly in applications like open-domain dialogue systems or real-life dialogue interactions. This paper aims to improve the user experience that involves multi-round long dialogues by efficiently detecting OOD dialogues and images. We introduce a novel scoring framework named Dialogue Image Aligning and Enhancing Framework (DIAEF) that integrates the visual language models with the novel proposed scores that detect OOD in two key scenarios (1) mismatches between the dialogue and image input pair and (2) input pairs with previously unseen labels. Our experimental results, derived from various benchmarks, demonstrate that integrating image and multi-round dialogue OOD detection is more effective with previously unseen labels than using either modality independently. In the presence of mismatched pairs, our proposed score effectively identifies these mismatches and demonstrates strong robustness in long dialogues. This approach enhances domain-aware, adaptive conversational agents and establishes baselines for future studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pooria Madani</p>
<p>Abstract: Code metamorphism refers to a computer programming exercise wherein the program modifies its own code (partial or entire) consistently and automatically while retaining its core functionality. This technique is often used for online performance optimization and automated crash recovery in certain mission-critical applications. However, the technique has been misappropriated by malware creators to bypass signature-based detection measures instituted by anti-malware engines. However, current code mutation engines used by threat actors offer only a limited degree of mutation, which is frequently detectable via static code analysis. The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT 4.0 and Google Bard may lead to a significant evolution in this landscape. These models have demonstrated a level of algorithm comprehension and code synthesis capability that closely resembles human abilities. This advancement has sparked concerns among experts that such models could be exploited by threat actors to generate sophisticated metamorphic malware. This paper explores the potential of several prominent LLMs for software code mutation that may be used to reconstruct (with mutation) existing malware code bases or create new forms of embedded mutation engines for next-gen metamorphic malwares. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating self-testing program mutation engines based on LLM/Transformer-based models. The proposed framework serves as an essential tool in testing next-gen metamorphic malware detection engines.</p>

<p>Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, allowing models to solve complex tasks in a stepwise manner. However, training CoT capabilities requires detailed reasoning data, which is often scarce. The self-taught reasoner (STaR) framework addresses this by using reinforcement learning to automatically generate reasoning steps, reducing reliance on human-labeled data. Although STaR and its variants have demonstrated empirical success, a theoretical foundation explaining these improvements is lacking. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on CoT reasoning and STaR. Our contributions are: (1) an analysis of policy improvement, showing why LLM reasoning improves iteratively with STaR; (2) conditions for convergence to an optimal reasoning policy; (3) an examination of STaR's robustness, explaining how it can improve reasoning even when incorporating occasional incorrect steps; and (4) criteria for the quality of pre-trained models necessary to initiate effective reasoning improvement. This framework aims to bridge empirical findings with theoretical insights, advancing reinforcement learning approaches for reasoning in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinghao Wang, Pengyu Wang, Bo Wang, Dong Zhang, Yunhua Zhou, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet their deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices. While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from \textit{capability} to \textit{availability}, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BitStack}, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization.

The utilization of deep learning techniques in cognitive radio networks can significantly enhance the network's capability to adapt to changing environments and improve the overall system's efficiency and reliability. As the demand for higher data rates and connectivity increases, B5G/6G wireless networks are expected to enable new services and applications significantly. Therefore, the significance of deep learning in addressing cognitive radio network challenges cannot be overstated. This review article provides valuable insights into potential solutions that can serve as a foundation for the development of future B5G/6G services. By leveraging the power of deep learning, cognitive radio networks can pave the way for the next generation of wireless networks capable of meeting the ever-increasing demands for higher data rates, improved reliability, and security.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theo Clark, Benedetta Cevoli, Eloy de Jong, Timofey Abramski, Jamie Dougherty</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have become crucial in speech processing, with recent advancements concentrating on developing architectures that capture representations across multiple timescales. The primary goal of these multi-scale architectures is to exploit the hierarchical nature of speech, where lower-resolution components aim to capture representations that align with increasingly abstract concepts (e.g., from phones to words to sentences). Although multi-scale approaches have demonstrated some improvements over single-scale models, the precise reasons for these enhancements have poor empirical support. In this study, we present an initial analysis of layer-wise representations in multi-scale architectures, with a focus on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Mutual Information (MI). We apply this analysis to Multi-Resolution HuBERT (MR-HuBERT) and find that (1) the improved performance on SUPERB tasks is primarily due to the auxiliary low-resolution loss rather than the downsampling itself, and (2) downsampling to lower resolutions neither improves downstream performance nor correlates with higher-level information (e.g., words), though it does improve computational efficiency. These findings challenge assumptions about the multi-scale nature of MR-HuBERT and motivate the importance of disentangling computational efficiency from learning better representations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We consider the problem of testing and learning from data in the presence of resource constraints, such as limited memory or weak data access, which place limitations on the efficiency and feasibility of testing or learning. In particular, we ask the following question: Could a resource-constrained learner/tester use interaction with a resource-unconstrained but untrusted party to solve a learning or testing problem more efficiently than they could without such an interaction? In this work, we answer this question both abstractly and for concrete problems, in two complementary ways: For a wide variety of scenarios, we prove that a resource-constrained learner cannot gain any advantage through classical interaction with an untrusted prover. As a special case, we show that for the vast majority of testing and learning problems in which quantum memory is a meaningful resource, a memory-constrained quantum algorithm cannot overcome its limitations via classical communication with a memory-unconstrained quantum prover. In contrast, when quantum communication is allowed, we construct a variety of interactive proof protocols, for specific learning and testing problems, which allow memory-constrained quantum verifiers to gain significant advantages through delegation to untrusted provers. These results highlight both the limitations and potential of delegating learning and testing problems to resource-rich but untrusted third parties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia Fu, Xiao Zhang, Sepideh Pashami, Fatemeh Rahimian, Anders Holst</p>
<p>Abstract: In the ever-evolving adversarial machine learning landscape, developing effective defenses against patch attacks has become a critical challenge, necessitating reliable solutions to safeguard real-world AI systems. Although diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis and have been recently utilized to counter $\ell_p$-norm bounded attacks, their potential in mitigating localized patch attacks remains largely underexplored. In this work, we propose DiffPAD, a novel framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models for adversarial patch decontamination. DiffPAD first performs super-resolution restoration on downsampled input images, then adopts binarization, dynamic thresholding scheme and sliding window for effective localization of adversarial patches. Such a design is inspired by the theoretically derived correlation between patch size and diffusion restoration error that is generalized across diverse patch attack scenarios. Finally, DiffPAD applies inpainting techniques to the original input images with the estimated patch region being masked. By integrating closed-form solutions for super-resolution restoration and image inpainting into the conditional reverse sampling process of a pre-trained diffusion model, DiffPAD obviates the need for text guidance or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DiffPAD not only achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness against patch attacks but also excels in recovering naturalistic images without patch remnants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liang He, Peiran Jin, Yaosen Min, Shufang Xie, Lijun Wu, Tao Qin, Xiaozhuan Liang, Kaiyuan Gao, Yuliang Jiang, Tie-Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Proteins, essential to biological systems, perform functions intricately linked to their three-dimensional structures. Understanding the relationship between protein structures and their amino acid sequences remains a core challenge in protein modeling. While traditional protein foundation models benefit from pre-training on vast unlabeled datasets, they often struggle to capture critical co-evolutionary information, which evolutionary-based methods excel at. In this study, we introduce a novel pre-training strategy for protein foundation models that emphasizes the interactions among amino acid residues to enhance the extraction of both short-range and long-range co-evolutionary features from sequence data. Trained on a large-scale protein sequence dataset, our model demonstrates superior generalization ability, outperforming established baselines of similar size, including the ESM model, across diverse downstream tasks. Experimental results confirm the model's effectiveness in integrating co-evolutionary information, marking a significant step forward in protein sequence-based modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohui Li, Rebecca J. Passonneau</p>
<p>Abstract: Classifier models are prevalent in natural language processing (NLP), often with high accuracy. Yet in real world settings, human-in-the-loop systems can foster trust in model outputs and even higher performance. Selective Prediction (SP) methods determine when to adopt a classifier's output versus defer to a human. Previous SP approaches have addressed how to improve softmax as a measure of model confidence, or have developed separate confidence estimators. One previous method involves learning a deferral model based on engineered features. We introduce a novel joint-training approach that simultaneously optimizes learned representations used by the classifier module and a learned deferral policy. Our results on four classification tasks demonstrate that joint training not only leads to better SP outcomes over two strong baselines, but also improves the performance of both modules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tim R. Winter, Ashok M. Sundaram, Werner Friedl, Maximo A. Roa, Freek Stulp, Jo\~ao Silv\'erio</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating context-adaptive manipulation and grasping actions is a challenging problem in robotics. Classical planning and control algorithms tend to be inflexible with regard to parameterization by external variables such as object shapes. In contrast, Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approaches, due to their nature as function approximators, allow for introducing external variables to modulate policies in response to the environment. In this paper, we utilize this property by introducing an LfD approach to acquire context-dependent grasping and manipulation strategies. We treat the problem as a kernel-based function approximation, where the kernel inputs include generic context variables describing task-dependent parameters such as the object shape. We build on existing work on policy fusion with uncertainty quantification to propose a state-dependent approach that automatically returns to demonstrations, avoiding unpredictable behavior while smoothly adapting to context changes. The approach is evaluated against the LASA handwriting dataset and on a real 7-DoF robot in two scenarios: adaptation to slippage while grasping and manipulating a deformable food item.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junliang Du, Yiru Cang, Tong Zhou, Jiacheng Hu, Weijie He</p>
<p>Abstract: This study introduces the Hybrid Multi-modal VGG (HM-VGG) model, a cutting-edge deep learning approach for the early diagnosis of glaucoma. The HM-VGG model utilizes an attention mechanism to process Visual Field (VF) data, enabling the extraction of key features that are vital for identifying early signs of glaucoma. Despite the common reliance on large annotated datasets, the HM-VGG model excels in scenarios with limited data, achieving remarkable results with small sample sizes. The model's performance is underscored by its high metrics in Precision, Accuracy, and F1-Score, indicating its potential for real-world application in glaucoma detection. The paper also discusses the challenges associated with ophthalmic image analysis, particularly the difficulty of obtaining large volumes of annotated data. It highlights the importance of moving beyond single-modality data, such as VF or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images alone, to a multimodal approach that can provide a richer, more comprehensive dataset. This integration of different data types is shown to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy. The HM- VGG model offers a promising tool for doctors, streamlining the diagnostic process and improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, its applicability extends to telemedicine and mobile healthcare, making diagnostic services more accessible. The research presented in this paper is a significant step forward in the field of medical image processing and has profound implications for clinical ophthalmology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Iman Kazemian, Murat Yildirim, Paritosh Ramanan</p>
<p>Abstract: Operations and maintenance (O&M) is a fundamental problem in wind energy systems with far reaching implications for reliability and profitability. Optimizing O&M is a multi-faceted decision optimization problem that requires a careful balancing act across turbine level failure risks, operational revenues, and maintenance crew logistics. The resulting O&M problems are typically solved using large-scale mixed integer programming (MIP) models, which yield computationally challenging problems that require either long-solution times, or heuristics to reach a solution. To address this problem, we introduce a novel decision-making framework for wind farm O&M that builds on a multi-head attention (MHA) models, an emerging artificial intelligence methods that are specifically designed to learn in rich and complex problem settings. The development of proposed MHA framework incorporates a number of modeling innovations that allows explicit embedding of MIP models within an MHA structure. The proposed MHA model (i) significantly reduces the solution time from hours to seconds, (ii) guarantees feasibility of the proposed solutions considering complex constraints that are omnipresent in wind farm O&M, (iii) results in significant solution quality compared to the conventional MIP formulations, and (iv) exhibits significant transfer learning capability across different problem settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diana Cai, Chirag Modi, Charles C. Margossian, Robert M. Gower, David M. Blei, Lawrence K. Saul</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop EigenVI, an eigenvalue-based approach for black-box variational inference (BBVI). EigenVI constructs its variational approximations from orthogonal function expansions. For distributions over $\mathbb{R}^D$, the lowest order term in these expansions provides a Gaussian variational approximation, while higher-order terms provide a systematic way to model non-Gaussianity. These approximations are flexible enough to model complex distributions (multimodal, asymmetric), but they are simple enough that one can calculate their low-order moments and draw samples from them. EigenVI can also model other types of random variables (e.g., nonnegative, bounded) by constructing variational approximations from different families of orthogonal functions. Within these families, EigenVI computes the variational approximation that best matches the score function of the target distribution by minimizing a stochastic estimate of the Fisher divergence. Notably, this optimization reduces to solving a minimum eigenvalue problem, so that EigenVI effectively sidesteps the iterative gradient-based optimizations that are required for many other BBVI algorithms. (Gradient-based methods can be sensitive to learning rates, termination criteria, and other tunable hyperparameters.) We use EigenVI to approximate a variety of target distributions, including a benchmark suite of Bayesian models from posteriordb. On these distributions, we find that EigenVI is more accurate than existing methods for Gaussian BBVI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde</p>
<p>Abstract: Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we prove formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joongkyu Lee, Min-hwan Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we prove that, in linear MDPs, the feature dimension $d$ is lower bounded by $S/U$ in order to aptly represent transition probabilities, where $S$ is the size of the state space and $U$ is the maximum size of directly reachable states. Hence, $d$ can still scale with $S$ depending on the direct reachability of the environment. To address this limitation of linear MDPs, we propose a novel structural aggregation framework based on dynamics, named as the "dynamics aggregation". For this newly proposed framework, we design a provably efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in linear function approximation that leverages aggregated sub-structures. Our proposed algorithm exhibits statistical efficiency, achieving a regret of $ \tilde{O} ( d_{\psi}^{3/2} H^{3/2}\sqrt{ N T} )$, where $d_{\psi}$ represents the feature dimension of aggregated subMDPs and $N$ signifies the number of aggregated subMDPs. We establish that the condition $d_{\psi}^3 N \ll d^{3}$ is readily met in most real-world environments with hierarchical structures, enabling a substantial improvement in the regret bound compared to LSVI-UCB, which enjoys a regret of $ \tilde{O} (d^{3/2} H^{3/2} \sqrt{ T})$. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first HRL algorithm with linear function approximation that offers provable guarantees.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binghao Huang, Yixuan Wang, Xinyi Yang, Yiyue Luo, Yunzhu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Tactile and visual perception are both crucial for humans to perform fine-grained interactions with their environment. Developing similar multi-modal sensing capabilities for robots can significantly enhance and expand their manipulation skills. This paper introduces \textbf{3D-ViTac}, a multi-modal sensing and learning system designed for dexterous bimanual manipulation. Our system features tactile sensors equipped with dense sensing units, each covering an area of 3$mm^2$. These sensors are low-cost and flexible, providing detailed and extensive coverage of physical contacts, effectively complementing visual information. To integrate tactile and visual data, we fuse them into a unified 3D representation space that preserves their 3D structures and spatial relationships. The multi-modal representation can then be coupled with diffusion policies for imitation learning. Through concrete hardware experiments, we demonstrate that even low-cost robots can perform precise manipulations and significantly outperform vision-only policies, particularly in safe interactions with fragile items and executing long-horizon tasks involving in-hand manipulation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin G. Herold, Evangelos Kipouridis, Joachim Spoerhase</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate the study of the following general clustering problem. We seek to partition a given set $P$ of data points into $k$ clusters by finding a set $X$ of $k$ centers and assigning each data point to one of the centers. The cost of a cluster, represented by a center $x\in X$, is a monotone, symmetric norm $f$ (inner norm) of the vector of distances of points assigned to $x$. The goal is to minimize a norm $g$ (outer norm) of the vector of cluster costs. This problem, which we call $(f,g)$-Clustering, generalizes many fundamental clustering problems such as $k$-Center, $k$-Median , Min-Sum of Radii, and Min-Load $k$-Clustering . A recent line of research (Chakrabarty, Swamy [STOC'19]) studies norm objectives that are oblivious to the cluster structure such as $k$-Median and $k$-Center. In contrast, our problem models cluster-aware objectives including Min-Sum of Radii and Min-Load $k$-Clustering.
  Our main results are as follows. First, we design a constant-factor approximation algorithm for $(\textsf{top}_\ell,\mathcal{L}_1)$-Clustering where the inner norm ($\textsf{top}_\ell$) sums over the $\ell$ largest distances. Second, we design a constant-factor approximation\ for $(\mathcal{L}_\infty,\textsf{Ord})$-Clustering where the outer norm is a convex combination of $\textsf{top}_\ell$ norms (ordered weighted norm).</p>

<p>Abstract: Image labeling is a critical bottleneck in the development of computer vision technologies, often constraining the potential of machine learning models due to the time-intensive nature of manual annotations. This work introduces a novel approach that leverages outpainting to address the problem of annotated data scarcity by generating artificial contexts and annotations, significantly reducing manual labeling efforts. We apply this technique to a particularly acute challenge in autonomous driving, urban planning, and environmental monitoring: the lack of diverse, eye-level vehicle images in desired classes. Our dataset comprises AI-generated vehicle images obtained by detecting and cropping vehicles from manually selected seed images, which are then outpainted onto larger canvases to simulate varied real-world conditions. The outpainted images include detailed annotations, providing high-quality ground truth data. Advanced outpainting techniques and image quality assessments ensure visual fidelity and contextual relevance. Augmentation with outpainted vehicles improves overall performance metrics by up to 8\% and enhances prediction of underrepresented classes by up to 20\%. This approach, exemplifying outpainting as a self-annotating paradigm, presents a solution that enhances dataset versatility across multiple domains of machine learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Reza Ibrahimzada, Kaiyao Ke, Mrigank Pawagi, Muhammad Salman Abid, Rangeet Pan, Saurabh Sinha, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand</p>
<p>Abstract: Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc.
  We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans translated the entire repository of these projects consisting of 6899 source code fragments. 99.1% of the translated code fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 25.8%. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 36 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the syntactically or semantically incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p>

<p>Abstract: Split conformal prediction techniques are applied to regression problems with circular responses by introducing a suitable conformity score, leading to prediction sets with adaptive arc length and finite-sample coverage guarantees for any circular predictive model under exchangeable data. Leveraging the high performance of existing predictive models designed for linear responses, we analyze a general projection procedure that converts any linear response regression model into one suitable for circular responses. When random forests serve as basis models in this projection procedure, we harness the out-of-bag dynamics to eliminate the necessity for a separate calibration sample in the construction of prediction sets. For synthetic and real datasets the resulting projected random forests model produces more efficient out-of-bag conformal prediction sets, with shorter median arc length, when compared to the split conformal prediction sets generated by two existing alternative models.</p>

We propose a chunk-wise approach to enable streamable DC-Spin without retraining and degradation. Comparisons of tokenization methods (self-supervised and neural audio codecs), model scalability, and downstream task proxies show that tokens easily modeled by an n-gram LM or aligned with phonemes offer strong performance, providing insights for designing speech tokenizers for SLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations is an effective means to teach robots manipulation skills. But data acquisition is a major bottleneck in applying this paradigm more broadly, due to the amount of cost and human effort involved. There has been significant interest in imitation learning for bimanual dexterous robots, like humanoids. Unfortunately, data collection is even more challenging here due to the challenges of simultaneously controlling multiple arms and multi-fingered hands. Automated data generation in simulation is a compelling, scalable alternative to fuel this need for data. To this end, we introduce DexMimicGen, a large-scale automated data generation system that synthesizes trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations for humanoid robots with dexterous hands. We present a collection of simulation environments in the setting of bimanual dexterous manipulation, spanning a range of manipulation behaviors and different requirements for coordination among the two arms. We generate 21K demos across these tasks from just 60 source human demos and study the effect of several data generation and policy learning decisions on agent performance. Finally, we present a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline and deploy it on a real-world humanoid can sorting task. Videos and more are at https://dexmimicgen.github.io/</p>

<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is a supervised fine-tuning approach that significantly improves the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions. We propose SelfCodeAlign, the first fully transparent and permissive pipeline for self-aligning code LLMs without extensive human annotations or distillation. SelfCodeAlign employs the same base model for inference throughout the data generation process. It first extracts diverse coding concepts from high-quality seed snippets to generate new tasks. It then samples multiple responses per task, pairs each with test cases, and validates them in a sandbox environment. Finally, passing examples are selected for instruction tuning. In our primary experiments, we use SelfCodeAlign with CodeQwen1.5-7B to generate a dataset of 74k instruction-response pairs. Finetuning on this dataset leads to a model that achieves a 67.1 pass@1 on HumanEval+, surpassing CodeLlama-70B-Instruct despite being ten times smaller. Across all benchmarks, this finetuned model consistently outperforms the original version trained with OctoPack, the previous state-of-the-art method for instruction tuning without human annotations or distillation. Additionally, we show that SelfCodeAlign is effective across LLMs of various sizes, from 3B to 33B, and that the base models can benefit more from alignment with their own data distribution. We further validate each component's effectiveness in our pipeline, showing that SelfCodeAlign outperforms both direct distillation from GPT-4o and leading GPT-3.5-based distillation methods, such as OSS-Instruct and Evol-Instruct. SelfCodeAlign has also led to the creation of StarCoder2-Instruct, the first fully transparent, permissively licensed, and self-aligned code LLM that achieves state-of-the-art coding performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajun Xi, Yinong He, Jianing Yang, Yinpei Dai, Joyce Chai</p>
<p>Abstract: In real-world scenarios, it is desirable for embodied agents to have the ability to leverage human language to gain explicit or implicit knowledge for learning tasks. Despite recent progress, most previous approaches adopt simple low-level instructions as language inputs, which may not reflect natural human communication. It's not clear how to incorporate rich language use to facilitate task learning. To address this question, this paper studies different types of language inputs in facilitating reinforcement learning (RL) embodied agents. More specifically, we examine how different levels of language informativeness (i.e., feedback on past behaviors and future guidance) and diversity (i.e., variation of language expressions) impact agent learning and inference. Our empirical results based on four RL benchmarks demonstrate that agents trained with diverse and informative language feedback can achieve enhanced generalization and fast adaptation to new tasks. These findings highlight the pivotal role of language use in teaching embodied agents new tasks in an open world. Project website: https://github.com/sled-group/Teachable_RL</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pio Calderon, Alexander Soen, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu</p>
<p>Abstract: The multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) is widely used for analyzing data streams that interact with each other, where events generate new events within their own dimension (via self-excitation) or across different dimensions (via cross-excitation). However, in certain applications, the timestamps of individual events in some dimensions are unobservable, and only event counts within intervals are known, referred to as partially interval-censored data. The MHP is unsuitable for handling such data since its estimation requires event timestamps. In this study, we introduce the Partially Censored Multivariate Hawkes Process (PCMHP), a novel point process which shares parameter equivalence with the MHP and can effectively model both timestamped and interval-censored data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the PCMHP using synthetic and real-world datasets. Firstly, we illustrate that the PCMHP can approximate MHP parameters and recover the spectral radius using synthetic event histories. Next, we assess the performance of the PCMHP in predicting YouTube popularity and find that the PCMHP outperforms the popularity estimation algorithm Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP). Comparing with the fully interval-censored HIP, we show that the PCMHP improves prediction performance by accounting for point process dimensions, particularly when there exist significant cross-dimension interactions. Lastly, we leverage the PCMHP to gain qualitative insights from a dataset comprising daily COVID-19 case counts from multiple countries and COVID-19-related news articles. By clustering the PCMHP-modeled countries, we unveil hidden interaction patterns between occurrences of COVID-19 cases and news reporting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anderson Santana de Oliveira, Caelin Kaplan, Khawla Mallat, Tanmay Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have shown that selecting an optimal model architecture suited to the differential privacy setting is necessary to achieve the best possible utility for a given privacy budget using differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD)(Tramer and Boneh 2020; Cheng et al. 2022). In light of these findings, we empirically analyse how different fairness notions, belonging to distinct classes of statistical fairness criteria (independence, separation and sufficiency), are impacted when one selects a model architecture suitable for DP-SGD, optimized for utility. Using standard datasets from ML fairness literature, we show using a rigorous experimental protocol, that by selecting the optimal model architecture for DP-SGD, the differences across groups concerning the relevant fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds and predictive parity) more often decrease or are negligibly impacted, compared to the non-private baseline, for which optimal model architecture has also been selected to maximize utility. These findings challenge the understanding that differential privacy will necessarily exacerbate unfairness in deep learning models trained on biased datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William T. Redman, Juan M. Bello-Rivas, Maria Fonoberova, Ryan Mohr, Ioannis G. Kevrekidis, Igor Mezi\'c</p>
<p>Abstract: Study of the nonlinear evolution deep neural network (DNN) parameters undergo during training has uncovered regimes of distinct dynamical behavior. While a detailed understanding of these phenomena has the potential to advance improvements in training efficiency and robustness, the lack of methods for identifying when DNN models have equivalent dynamics limits the insight that can be gained from prior work. Topological conjugacy, a notion from dynamical systems theory, provides a precise definition of dynamical equivalence, offering a possible route to address this need. However, topological conjugacies have historically been challenging to compute. By leveraging advances in Koopman operator theory, we develop a framework for identifying conjugate and non-conjugate training dynamics. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that comparing Koopman eigenvalues can correctly identify a known equivalence between online mirror descent and online gradient descent. We then utilize our approach to: (a) identify non-conjugate training dynamics between shallow and wide fully connected neural networks; (b) characterize the early phase of training dynamics in convolutional neural networks; (c) uncover non-conjugate training dynamics in Transformers that do and do not undergo grokking. Our results, across a range of DNN architectures, illustrate the flexibility of our framework and highlight its potential for shedding new light on training dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbo Zhou, Yixuan Du, Ruqiong Zhang, Jun Xia, Zhizhi Yu, Zelin Zang, Di Jin, Carl Yang, Rui Zhang, Stan Z. Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a type of neural network that can learn from graph-structured data through neighborhood information aggregation, have shown superior performance in various downstream tasks. However, as the number of layers increases, node representations become indistinguishable, which is known as over-smoothing. To address this issue, many residual methods have emerged. In this paper, we focus on the over-smoothing issue and related residual methods. Firstly, we revisit over-smoothing from the perspective of overlapping neighborhood subgraphs, and based on this, we explain how residual methods can alleviate over-smoothing by integrating multiple orders neighborhood subgraphs to avoid the indistinguishability of the single high-order neighborhood subgraphs. Additionally, we reveal the drawbacks of previous residual methods, such as the lack of node adaptability and severe loss of high-order neighborhood subgraph information, and propose a \textbf{Posterior-Sampling-based, Node-Adaptive Residual module (PSNR)}. We theoretically demonstrate that PSNR can alleviate the drawbacks of previous residual methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments verify the superiority of the PSNR module in fully observed node classification and missing feature scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yivan Zhang, Masashi Sugiyama</p>
<p>Abstract: Disentangling the explanatory factors in complex data is a promising approach for generalizable and data-efficient representation learning. While a variety of quantitative metrics for learning and evaluating disentangled representations have been proposed, it remains unclear what properties these metrics truly quantify. In this work, we establish algebraic relationships between logical definitions and quantitative metrics to derive theoretically grounded disentanglement metrics. Concretely, we introduce a compositional approach for converting a higher-order predicate into a real-valued quantity by replacing (i) equality with a strict premetric, (ii) the Heyting algebra of binary truth values with a quantale of continuous values, and (iii) quantifiers with aggregators. The metrics induced by logical definitions have strong theoretical guarantees, and some of them are easily differentiable and can be used as learning objectives directly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics by isolating different aspects of disentangled representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenz Wolf, Mirco Musolesi</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing modular Reinforcement Learning (RL) architectures are generally based on reusable components, also allowing for "plug-and-play" integration. However, these modules are homogeneous in nature - in fact, they essentially provide policies obtained via RL through the maximization of individual reward functions. Consequently, such solutions still lack the ability to integrate and process multiple types of information (i.e., heterogeneous knowledge representations), such as rules, sub-goals, and skills from various sources. In this paper, we discuss several practical examples of heterogeneous knowledge and propose Augmented Modular Reinforcement Learning (AMRL) to address these limitations. Our framework uses a selector to combine heterogeneous modules and seamlessly incorporate different types of knowledge representations and processing mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the performance and efficiency improvements, also in terms of generalization, that can be achieved by augmenting traditional modular RL with heterogeneous knowledge sources and processing mechanisms. Finally, we examine the safety, robustness, and interpretability issues stemming from the introduction of knowledge heterogeneity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Yunis, Justin Jung, Falcon Dai, Matthew Walter</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning is difficult due to the requirement of long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Moreover, in continuous action spaces there are an infinite number of possible actions, which only increases the difficulty of exploration. One class of methods designed to address these issues forms temporally extended actions, often called skills, from interaction data collected in the same domain, and optimizes a policy on top of this new action space. Typically such methods require a lengthy pretraining phase, especially in continuous action spaces, in order to form the skills before reinforcement learning can begin. Given prior evidence that the full range of the continuous action space is not required in such tasks, we propose a novel approach to skill-generation with two components. First we discretize the action space through clustering, and second we leverage a tokenization technique borrowed from natural language processing to generate temporally extended actions. Such a method outperforms baselines for skill-generation in several challenging sparse-reward domains, and requires orders-of-magnitude less computation in skill-generation and online rollouts.

<p>Abstract: We introduce the first continuous-time score-based generative model that leverages fractional diffusion processes for its underlying dynamics. Although diffusion models have excelled at capturing data distributions, they still suffer from various limitations such as slow convergence, mode-collapse on imbalanced data, and lack of diversity. These issues are partially linked to the use of light-tailed Brownian motion (BM) with independent increments. In this paper, we replace BM with an approximation of its non-Markovian counterpart, fractional Brownian motion (fBM), characterized by correlated increments and Hurst index $H \in (0,1)$, where $H=0.5$ recovers the classical BM. To ensure tractable inference and learning, we employ a recently popularized Markov approximation of fBM (MA-fBM) and derive its reverse-time model, resulting in generative fractional diffusion models (GFDM). We characterize the forward dynamics using a continuous reparameterization trick and propose augmented score matching to efficiently learn the score function, which is partly known in closed form, at minimal added cost. The ability to drive our diffusion model via MA-fBM offers flexibility and control. $H \leq 0.5$ enters the regime of rough paths whereas $H>0.5$ regularizes diffusion paths and invokes long-term memory. The Markov approximation allows added control by varying the number of Markov processes linearly combined to approximate fBM. Our evaluations on real image datasets demonstrate that GFDM achieves greater pixel-wise diversity and enhanced image quality, as indicated by a lower FID, offering a promising alternative to traditional diffusion models</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sebastian Damrich, Philipp Berens, Dmitry Kobak</p>
<p>Abstract: Persistent homology is a popular computational tool for analyzing the topology of point clouds, such as the presence of loops or voids. However, many real-world datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality reside in an ambient space of much higher dimensionality. We show that in this case traditional persistent homology becomes very sensitive to noise and fails to detect the correct topology. The same holds true for existing refinements of persistent homology. As a remedy, we find that spectral distances on the k-nearest-neighbor graph of the data, such as diffusion distance and effective resistance, allow to detect the correct topology even in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Moreover, we derive a novel closed-form formula for effective resistance, and describe its relation to diffusion distances. Finally, we apply these methods to high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data and show that spectral distances allow robust detection of cell cycle loops.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anay Mehrotra, Manolis Zampetakis, Paul Kassianik, Blaine Nelson, Hyrum Anderson, Yaron Singer, Amin Karbasi</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) display versatile functionality, they continue to generate harmful, biased, and toxic content, as demonstrated by the prevalence of human-designed jailbreaks. In this work, we present Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP), an automated method for generating jailbreaks that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. TAP utilizes an attacker LLM to iteratively refine candidate (attack) prompts until one of the refined prompts jailbreaks the target. In addition, before sending prompts to the target, TAP assesses them and prunes the ones unlikely to result in jailbreaks, reducing the number of queries sent to the target LLM. In empirical evaluations, we observe that TAP generates prompts that jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs (including GPT4-Turbo and GPT4o) for more than 80% of the prompts. This significantly improves upon the previous state-of-the-art black-box methods for generating jailbreaks while using a smaller number of queries than them. Furthermore, TAP is also capable of jailbreaking LLMs protected by state-of-the-art guardrails, e.g., LlamaGuard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiji Zhao, Ranjie Duan, Xizhe Wang, Xingxing Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely proved to be an effective method to improve the adversarial robustness against adversarial examples for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has demonstrated its superior performance in improving the robustness of small student models with the guidance of large teacher models. However, both AT and ARD encounter the robust fairness problem: these models exhibit strong robustness when facing part of classes (easy class), but weak robustness when facing others (hard class). In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis of the potential factors and argue that the smoothness degree of samples' soft labels for different classes (i.e., hard class or easy class) will affect the robust fairness of DNNs from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above finding, we propose an Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) method to mitigate the adversarial robust fairness problem within the framework of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes to achieve fairness by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of samples' soft labels during the training process, and the smoothness degree of soft labels is controlled by assigning different temperatures in KD to different classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art AT, ARD, and robust fairness methods in the comprehensive metric (Normalized Standard Deviation) of robustness and fairness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Honghao Wei, Xiyue Peng, Arnob Ghosh, Xin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose WSAC (Weighted Safe Actor-Critic), a novel algorithm for Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) under functional approximation, which can robustly optimize policies to improve upon an arbitrary reference policy with limited data coverage. WSAC is designed as a two-player Stackelberg game to optimize a refined objective function. The actor optimizes the policy against two adversarially trained value critics with small importance-weighted Bellman errors, which focus on scenarios where the actor's performance is inferior to the reference policy. In theory, we demonstrate that when the actor employs a no-regret optimization oracle, WSAC achieves a number of guarantees: (i) For the first time in the safe offline RL setting, we establish that WSAC can produce a policy that outperforms any reference policy while maintaining the same level of safety, which is critical to designing a safe algorithm for offline RL. (ii) WSAC achieves the optimal statistical convergence rate of $1/\sqrt{N}$ to the reference policy, where $N$ is the size of the offline dataset. (iii) We theoretically show that WSAC guarantees a safe policy improvement across a broad range of hyperparameters that control the degree of pessimism, indicating its practical robustness. Additionally, we offer a practical version of WSAC and compare it with existing state-of-the-art safe offline RL algorithms in several continuous control environments. WSAC outperforms all baselines across a range of tasks, supporting the theoretical results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adib Hasan, Ileana Rugina, Alex Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of model compression on the way Large Language Models (LLMs) process prompts, particularly concerning jailbreak resistance. We show that moderate WANDA pruning can enhance resistance to jailbreaking attacks without fine-tuning, while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks. To systematically evaluate this safety enhancement, we introduce a dataset of 225 harmful tasks across five categories. Our analysis of LLaMA-2 Chat, Vicuna 1.3, and Mistral Instruct v0.2 reveals that pruning benefits correlate with initial model safety levels. We interpret these results by examining changes in attention patterns and perplexity shifts, demonstrating that pruned models exhibit sharper attention and increased sensitivity to artificial jailbreak constructs. We extend our evaluation to the AdvBench harmful behavior tasks and the GCG attack method. We find that LLaMA-2 is much safer on AdvBench prompts than on our dataset when evaluated with manual jailbreak attempts, and that pruning is effective against both automated attacks and manual jailbreaking on Advbench.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work proposes a self-supervised training strategy designed for combinatorial problems. An obstacle in applying supervised paradigms to such problems is the need for costly target solutions often produced with exact solvers. Inspired by semi- and self-supervised learning, we show that generative models can be trained by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its self-supervision, eliminating the need for optimality information. We validate this Self-Labeling Improvement Method (SLIM) on the Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much attention from the neural combinatorial community. We propose a generative model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with SLIM. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and state-of-the-art learning proposals for the JSP. Lastly, we prove the robustness of SLIM to various parameters and its generality by applying it to the Traveling Salesman Problem.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models are versatile tools but are not suitable for small inference budgets. Small models have more efficient inference, but their lower capacity means that their performance can be good only if one limits their scope to a specialized domain. This paper explores how to get good specialized small language models using a large, generic, pretraining set and a limited amount of specialized data. We consider two scenarios, depending on whether (i) one can afford pretraining a model for each specialization task, or (ii) one wants to cheaply adapt a single pretrained model for each task. In the first scenario, we propose an effective solution based on importance sampling: we resample the pretraining set to imitate the specialization data and train a small model on it. In the second scenario, we propose a novel architecture, projected networks (PN). PN is a large network whose parameters can be linearly projected into a small network for specialization. For both scenarios, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our solutions across various domains, training set sizes, and training budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yong Liu, Guo Qin, Xiangdong Huang, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To fully revitalize the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation capability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which projects time series into the embedding space of language tokens and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability with larger LLMs. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By introducing LLM-embedded textual timestamps, AutoTimes can utilize chronological information to align multivariate time series. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over $5\times$ training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first framework that enables solving graph learning tasks of all levels (node, edge and graph) and all types (generation, regression and classification) using one formulation. We first formulate prediction tasks including regression and classification into a generic (conditional) generation framework, which enables diffusion models to perform deterministic tasks with provable guarantees. We then propose Latent Graph Diffusion (LGD), a generative model that can generate node, edge, and graph-level features of all categories simultaneously. We achieve this goal by embedding the graph structures and features into a latent space leveraging a powerful encoder and decoder, then training a diffusion model in the latent space. LGD is also capable of conditional generation through a specifically designed cross-attention mechanism. Leveraging LGD and the ``all tasks as generation'' formulation, our framework is capable of solving graph tasks of various levels and types. We verify the effectiveness of our framework with extensive experiments, where our models achieve state-of-the-art or highly competitive results across a wide range of generation and regression tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Jin, Tong Che, Hongwu Peng, Yiyuan Li, Dimitris N. Metaxas, Marco Pavone</p>
<p>Abstract: Generalization remains a central challenge in machine learning. In this work, we propose Learning from Teaching (LoT), a novel regularization technique for deep neural networks to enhance generalization. Inspired by the human ability to capture concise and abstract patterns, we hypothesize that generalizable correlations are expected to be easier to imitate. LoT operationalizes this concept to improve the generalization of the main model with auxiliary student learners. The student learners are trained by the main model and, in turn, provide feedback to help the main model capture more generalizable and imitable correlations. Our experimental results across several domains, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and methodologies like Reinforcement Learning, demonstrate that the introduction of LoT brings significant benefits compared to training models on the original dataset. The results suggest the effectiveness and efficiency of LoT in identifying generalizable information at the right scales while discarding spurious data correlations, thus making LoT a valuable addition to current machine learning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Huang, Vishal Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel family of decision-aware surrogate losses, called Perturbation Gradient (PG) losses, for the predict-then-optimize framework. The key idea is to connect the expected downstream decision loss with the directional derivative of a particular plug-in objective, and then approximate this derivative using zeroth order gradient techniques. Unlike the original decision loss which is typically piecewise constant and discontinuous, our new PG losses is a Lipschitz continuous, difference of concave functions that can be optimized using off-the-shelf gradient-based methods. Most importantly, unlike existing surrogate losses, the approximation error of our PG losses vanishes as the number of samples grows. Hence, optimizing our surrogate loss yields a best-in-class policy asymptotically, even in misspecified settings. This is the first such result in misspecified settings, and we provide numerical evidence confirming our PG losses substantively outperform existing proposals when the underlying model is misspecified.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihan Wu, Siddhartha Datta, Yi Su, Dheeraj Baby, Yu-Xiang Wang, Kilian Q. Weinberger</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper addresses the prevalent issue of label shift in an online setting with missing labels, where data distributions change over time and obtaining timely labels is challenging. While existing methods primarily focus on adjusting or updating the final layer of a pre-trained classifier, we explore the untapped potential of enhancing feature representations using unlabeled data at test-time. Our novel method, Online Label Shift adaptation with Online Feature Updates (OLS-OFU), leverages self-supervised learning to refine the feature extraction process, thereby improving the prediction model. By carefully designing the algorithm, theoretically OLS-OFU maintains the similar online regret convergence to the results in the literature while taking the improved features into account. Empirically, it achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, which is as significant as the gains existing methods have over the baseline (i.e., without distribution shift adaptations).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Bonfanti, Giuseppe Bruno, Cristina Cipriani</p>
<p>Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) viewpoint is widely employed to analyze the training dynamics of overparameterized Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, unlike the case of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), we show how the NTK perspective falls short in the nonlinear scenario. Specifically, we establish that the NTK yields a random matrix at initialization that is not constant during training, contrary to conventional belief. Another significant difference from the linear regime is that, even in the idealistic infinite-width limit, the Hessian does not vanish and hence it cannot be disregarded during training. This motivates the adoption of second-order optimization methods. We explore the convergence guarantees of such methods in both linear and nonlinear cases, addressing challenges such as spectral bias and slow convergence. Every theoretical result is supported by numerical examples with both linear and nonlinear PDEs, and we highlight the benefits of second-order methods in benchmark test cases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Liu, Yongqiang Chen, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong, James Cheng, Bo Han, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Revealing the underlying causal mechanisms in the real world is the key to the development of science. Despite the progress in the past decades, traditional causal discovery approaches (CDs) mainly rely on high-quality measured variables, usually given by human experts, to find causal relations. The lack of well-defined high-level variables in many real-world applications has already been a longstanding roadblock to a broader application of CDs. To this end, this paper presents Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT) that introduces large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap. LLMs are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated great capability in extracting key information from unstructured data. Therefore, it is natural to employ LLMs to assist with proposing useful high-level factors and crafting their measurements. Meanwhile, COAT also adopts CDs to find causal relations among the identified variables as well as to provide feedback to LLMs to iteratively refine the proposed factors. We show that LLMs and CDs are mutually beneficial and the constructed feedback provably also helps with the factor proposal. We construct and curate several synthetic and real-world benchmarks including analysis of human reviews and diagnosis of neuropathic and brain tumors, to comprehensively evaluate COAT. Extensive empirical results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of COAT with significant improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deqian Kong, Dehong Xu, Minglu Zhao, Bo Pang, Jianwen Xie, Andrew Lizarraga, Yuhao Huang, Sirui Xie, Ying Nian Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: In tasks aiming for long-term returns, planning becomes essential. We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikang Wan, Ziyu Wang, Yufei Wang, Zackory Erickson, David Held</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces DiffTORI, which utilizes Differentiable Trajectory Optimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep Reinforcement and Imitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichuan Mo, Yuji Wang, Zeming Wei, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jose Pablo Folch, Calvin Tsay, Robert M Lee, Behrang Shafei, Weronika Ormaniec, Andreas Krause, Mark van der Wilk, Ruth Misener, Mojm\'ir Mutn\'y</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a methodology to optimize black-box functions. Traditionally, it focuses on the setting where you can arbitrarily query the search space. However, many real-life problems do not offer this flexibility; in particular, the search space of the next query may depend on previous ones. Example challenges arise in the physical sciences in the form of local movement constraints, required monotonicity in certain variables, and transitions influencing the accuracy of measurements. Altogether, such transition constraints necessitate a form of planning. This work extends classical Bayesian optimization via the framework of Markov Decision Processes. We iteratively solve a tractable linearization of our utility function using reinforcement learning to obtain a policy that plans ahead for the entire horizon. This is a parallel to the optimization of an acquisition function in policy space. The resulting policy is potentially history-dependent and non-Markovian. We showcase applications in chemical reactor optimization, informative path planning, machine calibration, and other synthetic examples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shahar Yadin, Noam Elata, Tomer Michaeli</p>
<p>Abstract: A prominent family of methods for learning data distributions relies on density ratio estimation (DRE), where a model is trained to $\textit{classify}$ between data samples and samples from some reference distribution. DRE-based models can directly output the likelihood for any given input, a highly desired property that is lacking in most generative techniques. Nevertheless, to date, DRE methods have failed in accurately capturing the distributions of complex high-dimensional data, like images, and have thus been drawing reduced research attention in recent years. In this work we present $\textit{classification diffusion models}$ (CDMs), a DRE-based generative method that adopts the formalism of denoising diffusion models (DDMs) while making use of a classifier that predicts the level of noise added to a clean signal. Our method is based on an analytical connection that we derive between the MSE-optimal denoiser for removing white Gaussian noise and the cross-entropy-optimal classifier for predicting the noise level. Our method is the first DRE-based technique that can successfully generate images beyond the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, it can output the likelihood of any input in a single forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art negative log likelihood (NLL) among methods with this property.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanbang Wang, Hejie Cui, Jon Kleinberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphs data is crucial for many applications, and much of it exists in the relations described in textual format. As a result, being able to accurately recall and encode a graph described in earlier text is a basic yet pivotal ability that LLMs need to demonstrate if they are to perform reasoning tasks that involve graph-structured information. Human performance at graph recall has been studied by cognitive scientists for decades, and has been found to often exhibit certain structural patterns of bias that align with human handling of social relationships. To date, however, we know little about how LLMs behave in analogous graph recall tasks: do their recalled graphs also exhibit certain biased patterns, and if so, how do they compare with humans and affect other graph reasoning tasks? In this work, we perform the first systematical study of graph recall by LLMs, investigating the accuracy and biased microstructures (local structural patterns) in their recall. We find that LLMs not only underperform often in graph recall, but also tend to favor more triangles and alternating 2-paths. Moreover, we find that more advanced LLMs have a striking dependence on the domain that a real-world graph comes from -- by yielding the best recall accuracy when the graph is narrated in a language style consistent with its original domain.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12711">Uniform Last-Iterate Guarantee for Bandits and Reinforcement Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junyan Liu, Yunfan Li, Ruosong Wang, Lin F. Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing metrics for reinforcement learning (RL) such as regret, PAC bounds, or uniform-PAC (Dann et al., 2017), typically evaluate the cumulative performance, while allowing the agent to play an arbitrarily bad policy at any finite time t. Such a behavior can be highly detrimental in high-stakes applications. This paper introduces a stronger metric, uniform last-iterate (ULI) guarantee, capturing both cumulative and instantaneous performance of RL algorithms. Specifically, ULI characterizes the instantaneous performance by ensuring that the per-round suboptimality of the played policy is bounded by a function, monotonically decreasing w.r.t. round t, preventing revisiting bad policies when sufficient samples are available. We demonstrate that a near-optimal ULI guarantee directly implies near-optimal cumulative performance across aforementioned metrics, but not the other way around. To examine the achievability of ULI, we first provide two positive results for bandit problems with finite arms, showing that elimination-based algorithms and high-probability adversarial algorithms with stronger analysis or additional designs, can attain near-optimal ULI guarantees. We also provide a negative result, indicating that optimistic algorithms cannot achieve near-optimal ULI guarantee. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm for linear bandits with infinitely many arms, which achieves the ULI guarantee, given access to an optimization oracle. Finally, we propose an algorithm that achieves near-optimal ULI guarantee for the online reinforcement learning setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: We contribute NeuralSolver, a novel recurrent solver that can efficiently and consistently extrapolate, i.e., learn algorithms from smaller problems (in terms of observation size) and execute those algorithms in large problems. Contrary to previous recurrent solvers, NeuralSolver can be naturally applied in both same-size problems, where the input and output sizes are the same, and in different-size problems, where the size of the input and output differ. To allow for this versatility, we design NeuralSolver with three main components: a recurrent module, that iteratively processes input information at different scales, a processing module, responsible for aggregating the previously processed information, and a curriculum-based training scheme, that improves the extrapolation performance of the method. To evaluate our method we introduce a set of novel different-size tasks and we show that NeuralSolver consistently outperforms the prior state-of-the-art recurrent solvers in extrapolating to larger problems, considering smaller training problems and requiring less parameters than other approaches.</p>

<p>Abstract: This work explores the challenging problem of molecule design by framing it as a conditional generative modeling task, where target biological properties or desired chemical constraints serve as conditioning variables. We propose the Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT), a novel generative model comprising three components: (1) a latent vector with a learnable prior distribution modeled by a neural transformation of Gaussian white noise; (2) a molecule generation model based on a causal Transformer, which uses the latent vector as a prompt; and (3) a property prediction model that predicts a molecule's target properties and/or constraint values using the latent prompt. LPT can be learned by maximum likelihood estimation on molecule-property pairs. During property optimization, the latent prompt is inferred from target properties and constraints through posterior sampling and then used to guide the autoregressive molecule generation. After initial training on existing molecules and their properties, we adopt an online learning algorithm to progressively shift the model distribution towards regions that support desired target properties. Experiments demonstrate that LPT not only effectively discovers useful molecules across single-objective, multi-objective, and structure-constrained optimization tasks, but also exhibits strong sample efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Operational weather forecasting system relies on computationally expensive physics-based models. Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christos Thrampoulidis</p>
<p>Abstract: We initiate an investigation into the optimization properties of next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant training paradigm for modern language models. Specifically, we study the structural properties of the solutions selected by gradient-based optimizers among the many possible minimizers of the NTP objective. By framing NTP as cross-entropy minimization across distinct contexts, each tied with a sparse conditional probability distribution across a finite vocabulary of tokens, we introduce "NTP-separability conditions" that enable reaching the data-entropy lower bound. With this setup, and focusing on linear models with fixed context embeddings, we characterize the optimization bias of gradient descent (GD): Within the data subspace defined by the sparsity patterns of distinct contexts, GD selects parameters that equate the logits' differences of in-support tokens to their log-odds. In the orthogonal subspace, the GD parameters diverge in norm and select the direction that maximizes a margin specific to NTP. These findings extend previous research on implicit bias in one-hot classification to the NTP setting, highlighting key differences and prompting further research into the optimization and generalization properties of NTP, irrespective of the specific architecture used to generate the context embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bach Do, Taiwo Adebiyi, Ruda Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has become a powerful tool for solving simulation-based engineering optimization problems thanks to its ability to integrate physical and mathematical understandings, consider uncertainty, and address the exploitation-exploration dilemma. Thompson sampling (TS) is a preferred solution for BO to handle the exploitation-exploration trade-off. While it prioritizes exploration by generating and minimizing random sample paths from probabilistic models -- a fundamental ingredient of BO -- TS weakly manages exploitation by gathering information about the true objective function after it obtains new observations. In this work, we improve the exploitation of TS by incorporating the $\varepsilon$-greedy policy, a well-established selection strategy in reinforcement learning. We first delineate two extremes of TS, namely the generic TS and the sample-average TS. The former promotes exploration, while the latter favors exploitation. We then adopt the $\varepsilon$-greedy policy to randomly switch between these two extremes. Small and large values of $\varepsilon$ govern exploitation and exploration, respectively. By minimizing two benchmark functions and solving an inverse problem of a steel cantilever beam, we empirically show that $\varepsilon$-greedy TS equipped with an appropriate $\varepsilon$ is more robust than its two extremes, matching or outperforming the better of the generic TS and the sample-average TS.</p>

<p>Abstract: Statistical heterogeneity in federated learning poses two major challenges: slow global training due to conflicting gradient signals, and the need of personalization for local distributions. In this work, we tackle both challenges by leveraging recent advances in \emph{linear mode connectivity} -- identifying a linearly connected low-loss region in the parameter space of neural networks, which we call solution simplex. We propose federated learning over connected modes (\textsc{Floco}), where clients are assigned local subregions in this simplex based on their gradient signals, and together learn the shared global solution simplex. This allows personalization of the client models to fit their local distributions within the degrees of freedom in the solution simplex and homogenizes the update signals for the global simplex training. Our experiments show that \textsc{Floco} accelerates the global training process, and significantly improves the local accuracy with minimal computational overhead in cross-silo federated learning settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Eysenbach, Vivek Myers, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Given time series data, how can we answer questions like "what will happen in the future?" and "how did we get here?" These sorts of probabilistic inference questions are challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how these questions can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By extending prior work to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that joint distribution of representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that representations learned via temporal contrastive learning follow a Gauss-Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., prediction, planning) over representations corresponds to inverting a low-dimensional matrix. In one special case, inferring intermediate representations will be equivalent to interpolating between the learned representations. We validate our theory using numerical simulations on tasks up to 46-dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chuning Zhu, Xinqi Wang, Tyler Han, Simon S. Du, Abhishek Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent agents must be generalists, capable of quickly adapting to various tasks. In reinforcement learning (RL), model-based RL learns a dynamics model of the world, in principle enabling transfer to arbitrary reward functions through planning. However, autoregressive model rollouts suffer from compounding error, making model-based RL ineffective for long-horizon problems. Successor features offer an alternative by modeling a policy's long-term state occupancy, reducing policy evaluation under new rewards to linear regression. Yet, zero-shot policy optimization for new tasks with successor features can be challenging. This work proposes a novel class of models, i.e., Distributional Successor Features for Zero-Shot Policy Optimization (DiSPOs), that learn a distribution of successor features of a stationary dataset's behavior policy, along with a policy that acts to realize different successor features achievable within the dataset. By directly modeling long-term outcomes in the dataset, DiSPOs avoid compounding error while enabling a simple scheme for zero-shot policy optimization across reward functions. We present a practical instantiation of DiSPOs using diffusion models and show their efficacy as a new class of transferable models, both theoretically and empirically across various simulated robotics problems.

Identifying cancer patients at risk of heart failure (HF) is critical to improving cancer treatment outcomes and safety. This study examined machine learning (ML) models to identify cancer patients at risk of HF using electronic health records (EHRs), including traditional ML, Time-Aware long short-term memory (T-LSTM), and large language models (LLMs) using novel narrative features derived from the structured medical codes. We identified a cancer cohort of 12,806 patients from the University of Florida Health, diagnosed with lung, breast, and colorectal cancers, among which 1,602 individuals developed HF after cancer. The LLM, GatorTron-3.9B, achieved the best F1 scores, outperforming the traditional support vector machines by 0.397, the T-LSTM deep learning model by 0.077, and a widely used transformer model, BERT, by 0.056.

Furthermore, we examine downstream RL in reward-free, offline and online scenarios, where a new task is introduced to the agent that shares the same representation as the upstream offline tasks. Our theoretical results demonstrate the benefits of using the learned representation from the upstream offline task instead of directly learning the representation of the low-rank model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kimon Protopapas, Anas Barakat</p>
<p>Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) stands as a versatile algorithmic framework encompassing several seminal policy gradient algorithms such as natural policy gradient, with connections with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as TRPO and PPO. PMD can be seen as a soft Policy Iteration algorithm implementing regularized 1-step greedy policy improvement. However, 1-step greedy policies might not be the best choice and recent remarkable empirical successes in RL such as AlphaGo and AlphaZero have demonstrated that greedy approaches with respect to multiple steps outperform their 1-step counterpart. In this work, we propose a new class of PMD algorithms called $h$-PMD which incorporates multi-step greedy policy improvement with lookahead depth $h$ to the PMD update rule. To solve discounted infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes with discount factor $\gamma$, we show that $h$-PMD which generalizes the standard PMD enjoys a faster dimension-free $\gamma^h$-linear convergence rate, contingent on the computation of multi-step greedy policies. We propose an inexact version of $h$-PMD where lookahead action values are estimated. Under a generative model, we establish a sample complexity for $h$-PMD which improves over prior work. Finally, we extend our result to linear function approximation to scale to large state spaces. Under suitable assumptions, our sample complexity only involves dependence on the dimension of the feature map space instead of the state space size.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Artem Vysogorets, Kartik Ahuja, Julia Kempe</p>
<p>Abstract: In the era of exceptionally data-hungry models, careful selection of the training data is essential to mitigate the extensive costs of deep learning. Data pruning offers a solution by removing redundant or uninformative samples from the dataset, which yields faster convergence and improved neural scaling laws. However, little is known about its impact on classification bias of the trained models. We conduct the first systematic study of this effect and reveal that existing data pruning algorithms can produce highly biased classifiers. We present theoretical analysis of the classification risk in a mixture of Gaussians to argue that choosing appropriate class pruning ratios, coupled with random pruning within classes has potential to improve worst-class performance. We thus propose DRoP, a distributionally robust approach to pruning and empirically demonstrate its performance on standard computer vision benchmarks. In sharp contrast to existing algorithms, our proposed method continues improving distributional robustness at a tolerable drop of average performance as we prune more from the datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by applications of large embedding models, we study differentially private (DP) optimization problems under sparsity of individual gradients. We start with new near-optimal bounds for the classic mean estimation problem but with sparse data, improving upon existing algorithms particularly for the high-dimensional regime. Building on this, we obtain pure- and approximate-DP algorithms with almost optimal rates for stochastic convex optimization with sparse gradients; the former represents the first nearly dimension-independent rates for this problem. Finally, we study the approximation of stationary points for the empirical loss in approximate-DP optimization and obtain rates that depend on sparsity instead of dimension, modulo polylogarithmic factors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haozhe Tian, Homayoun Hamedmoghadam, Robert Shorten, Pietro Ferraro</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful method for controlling dynamic systems, but its learning mechanism can lead to unpredictable actions that undermine the safety of critical systems. Here, we propose RL with Adaptive Regularization (RL-AR), an algorithm that enables safe RL exploration by combining the RL policy with a policy regularizer that hard-codes the safety constraints. RL-AR performs policy combination via a "focus module," which determines the appropriate combination depending on the state--relying more on the safe policy regularizer for less-exploited states while allowing unbiased convergence for well-exploited states. In a series of critical control applications, we demonstrate that RL-AR not only ensures safety during training but also achieves a return competitive with the standards of model-free RL that disregards safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy McMahan</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm that efficiently computes near-optimal deterministic policies for constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) problems. Our approach combines three key ideas: (1) value-demand augmentation, (2) action-space approximate dynamic programming, and (3) time-space rounding. Our algorithm constitutes a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for any time-space recursive (TSR) cost criteria. A TSR criteria requires the cost of a policy to be computable recursively over both time and (state) space, which includes classical expectation, almost sure, and anytime constraints. Our work answers three open questions spanning two long-standing lines of research: polynomial-time approximability is possible for 1) anytime-constrained policies, 2) almost-sure-constrained policies, and 3) deterministic expectation-constrained policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oscar Davis, Samuel Kessler, Mircea Petrache, \.Ismail \.Ilkan Ceylan, Michael Bronstein, Avishek Joey Bose</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Gao, Stephan G\"unnemann</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuki Takezawa, Han Bao, Ryoma Sato, Kenta Niwa, Makoto Yamada</p>
<p>Abstract: Gradient descent and its variants are de facto standard algorithms for training machine learning models. As gradient descent is sensitive to its hyperparameters, we need to tune the hyperparameters carefully using a grid search. However, the method is time-consuming, particularly when multiple hyperparameters exist. Therefore, recent studies have analyzed parameter-free methods that adjust the hyperparameters on the fly. However, the existing work is limited to investigations of parameter-free methods for the stepsize, and parameter-free methods for other hyperparameters have not been explored. For instance, although the gradient clipping threshold is a crucial hyperparameter in addition to the stepsize for preventing gradient explosion issues, none of the existing studies have investigated parameter-free methods for clipped gradient descent. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the parameter-free methods for clipped gradient descent. Specifically, we propose Inexact Polyak Stepsize, which converges to the optimal solution without any hyperparameters tuning, and its convergence rate is asymptotically independent of $L$ under $L$-smooth and $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth assumptions of the loss function, similar to that of clipped gradient descent with well-tuned hyperparameters. We numerically validated our convergence results using a synthetic function and demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods using LSTM, Nano-GPT, and T5.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15743">Sparse maximal update parameterization: A holistic approach to sparse training dynamics</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Nolan Dey, Shane Bergsma, Joel Hestness</p>
<p>Abstract: Several challenges make it difficult for sparse neural networks to compete with dense models. First, setting a large fraction of weights to zero impairs forward and gradient signal propagation. Second, sparse studies often need to test multiple sparsity levels, while also introducing new hyperparameters (HPs), leading to prohibitive tuning costs. Indeed, the standard practice is to re-use the learning HPs originally crafted for dense models. Unfortunately, we show sparse and dense networks do not share the same optimal HPs. Without stable dynamics and effective training recipes, it is costly to test sparsity at scale, which is key to surpassing dense networks and making the business case for sparsity acceleration in hardware.
  A holistic approach is needed to tackle these challenges and we propose S$\mu$Par as one such approach. For random unstructured static sparsity, S$\mu$Par ensures activations, gradients, and weight updates all scale independently of sparsity level. Further, by reparameterizing the HPs, S$\mu$Par enables the same HP values to be optimal as we vary both sparsity level and model width. HPs can be tuned on small dense networks and transferred to large sparse models, greatly reducing tuning costs. On large-scale language modeling, S$\mu$Par shows increasing improvements over standard parameterization as sparsity increases, leading up to 11.9% relative loss improvement at 99.2% sparsity. A minimal implementation of S$\mu$Par is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/nanoGPT-mup/tree/supar.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16173">Diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning via Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shutong Ding, Ke Hu, Zhenhao Zhang, Kan Ren, Weinan Zhang, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have garnered widespread attention in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for their powerful expressiveness and multimodality. It has been verified that utilizing diffusion policies can significantly improve the performance of RL algorithms in continuous control tasks by overcoming the limitations of unimodal policies, such as Gaussian policies, and providing the agent with enhanced exploration capabilities. However, existing works mainly focus on the application of diffusion policies in offline RL, while their incorporation into online RL is less investigated. The training objective of the diffusion model, known as the variational lower bound, cannot be optimized directly in online RL due to the unavailability of 'good' actions. This leads to difficulties in conducting diffusion policy improvement. To overcome this, we propose a novel model-free diffusion-based online RL algorithm, Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization (QVPO). Specifically, we introduce the Q-weighted variational loss, which can be proved to be a tight lower bound of the policy objective in online RL under certain conditions. To fulfill these conditions, the Q-weight transformation functions are introduced for general scenarios. Additionally, to further enhance the exploration capability of the diffusion policy, we design a special entropy regularization term. We also develop an efficient behavior policy to enhance sample efficiency by reducing the variance of the diffusion policy during online interactions. Consequently, the QVPO algorithm leverages the exploration capabilities and multimodality of diffusion policies, preventing the RL agent from converging to a sub-optimal policy. To verify the effectiveness of QVPO, we conduct comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks. The final results demonstrate that QVPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both cumulative reward and sample efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Ouyang, Liyan Xie, Hongyuan Zha, Guang Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models, a specific type of generative model, have achieved unprecedented performance in recent years and consistently produce high-quality synthetic samples. A critical prerequisite for their notable success lies in the presence of a substantial number of training samples, which can be impractical in real-world applications due to high collection costs or associated risks. Consequently, various finetuning and regularization approaches have been proposed to transfer knowledge from existing pre-trained models to specific target domains with limited data. This paper introduces the Transfer Guided Diffusion Process (TGDP), a novel approach distinct from conventional finetuning and regularization methods. We prove that the optimal diffusion model for the target domain integrates pre-trained diffusion models on the source domain with additional guidance from a domain classifier. We further extend TGDP to a conditional version for modeling the joint distribution of data and its corresponding labels, together with two additional regularization terms to enhance the model performance. We validate the effectiveness of TGDP on both simulated and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuefeng Peng, Jaechul Roh, Subhransu Maji, Amir Houmansadr</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce One-Shot Label-Only (OSLO) membership inference attacks (MIAs), which accurately infer a given sample's membership in a target model's training set with high precision using just \emph{a single query}, where the target model only returns the predicted hard label. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art label-only attacks which require $\sim6000$ queries, yet get attack precisions lower than OSLO's. OSLO leverages transfer-based black-box adversarial attacks. The core idea is that a member sample exhibits more resistance to adversarial perturbations than a non-member. We compare OSLO against state-of-the-art label-only attacks and demonstrate that, despite requiring only one query, our method significantly outperforms previous attacks in terms of precision and true positive rate (TPR) under the same false positive rates (FPR). For example, compared to previous label-only MIAs, OSLO achieves a TPR that is at least 7$\times$ higher under a 1\% FPR and at least 22$\times$ higher under a 0.1\% FPR on CIFAR100 for a ResNet18 model. We evaluated multiple defense mechanisms against OSLO.</p>

Using a precise connection between the Hellinger geometry and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), we propose the interaction-force transport (IFT) gradient flows and its spherical variant via an infimal convolution of the Wasserstein and spherical MMD tensors. We then develop a particle-based optimization algorithm based on the JKO-splitting scheme of the mass-preserving spherical IFT gradient flows. Finally, we provide both theoretical global exponential convergence guarantees and improved empirical simulation results for applying the IFT gradient flows to the sampling task of MMD-minimization. Furthermore, we prove that the spherical IFT gradient flow enjoys the best of both worlds by providing the global exponential convergence guarantee for both the MMD and KL energy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Cadei, Lukas Lindorfer, Sylvia Cremer, Cordelia Schmid, Francesco Locatello</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several scientific phenomena. As many scientific questions are inherently causal, this paper looks at the causal inference task of treatment effect estimation, where the outcome of interest is recorded in high-dimensional observations in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Despite being the simplest possible causal setting and a perfect fit for deep learning, we theoretically find that many common choices in the literature may lead to biased estimates. To test the practical impact of these considerations, we recorded ISTAnt, the first real-world benchmark for causal inference downstream tasks on high-dimensional observations as an RCT studying how garden ants (Lasius neglectus) respond to microparticles applied onto their colony members by hygienic grooming. Comparing 6 480 models fine-tuned from state-of-the-art visual backbones, we find that the sampling and modeling choices significantly affect the accuracy of the causal estimate, and that classification accuracy is not a proxy thereof. We further validated the analysis, repeating it on a synthetically generated visual data set controlling the causal model. Our results suggest that future benchmarks should carefully consider real downstream scientific questions, especially causal ones. Further, we highlight guidelines for representation learning methods to help answer causal questions in the sciences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ShengYun Peng, Pin-Yu Chen, Matthew Hull, Duen Horng Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial to ensure that large language models (LLMs) behave in ways that align with human preferences and prevent harmful actions during inference. However, recent studies show that the alignment can be easily compromised through finetuning with only a few adversarially designed training examples. We aim to measure the risks in finetuning LLMs through navigating the LLM safety landscape. We discover a new phenomenon observed universally in the model parameter space of popular open-source LLMs, termed as "safety basin": random perturbations to model weights maintain the safety level of the original aligned model within its local neighborhood. However, outside this local region, safety is fully compromised, exhibiting a sharp, step-like drop. This safety basin contrasts sharply with the LLM capability landscape, where model performance peaks at the origin and gradually declines as random perturbation increases. Our discovery inspires us to propose the new VISAGE safety metric that measures the safety in LLM finetuning by probing its safety landscape. Visualizing the safety landscape of the aligned model enables us to understand how finetuning compromises safety by dragging the model away from the safety basin. The LLM safety landscape also highlights the system prompt's critical role in protecting a model, and that such protection transfers to its perturbed variants within the safety basin. These observations from our safety landscape research provide new insights for future work on LLM safety community.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dean Brandner, Sergio Lucia</p>
<p>Abstract: Model predictive control can optimally deal with nonlinear systems under consideration of constraints. The control performance depends on the model accuracy and the prediction horizon. Recent advances propose to use reinforcement learning applied to a parameterized model predictive controller to recover the optimal control performance even if an imperfect model or short prediction horizons are used. However, common reinforcement learning algorithms rely on first order updates, which only have a linear convergence rate and hence need an excessive amount of dynamic data. Higher order updates are typically intractable if the policy is approximated with neural networks due to the large number of parameters.
  In this work, we use a parameterized model predictive controller as policy, and leverage the small amount of necessary parameters to propose a trust-region constrained Quasi-Newton training algorithm for policy optimization with a superlinear convergence rate. We show that the required second order derivative information can be calculated by the solution of a linear system of equations. A simulation study illustrates that the proposed training algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of data efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling hyperparameter optimisation to very large datasets remains an open problem in the Gaussian process community. This paper focuses on iterative methods, which use linear system solvers, like conjugate gradients, alternating projections or stochastic gradient descent, to construct an estimate of the marginal likelihood gradient. We discuss three key improvements which are applicable across solvers: (i) a pathwise gradient estimator, which reduces the required number of solver iterations and amortises the computational cost of making predictions, (ii) warm starting linear system solvers with the solution from the previous step, which leads to faster solver convergence at the cost of negligible bias, (iii) early stopping linear system solvers after a limited computational budget, which synergises with warm starting, allowing solver progress to accumulate over multiple marginal likelihood steps. These techniques provide speed-ups of up to $72\times$ when solving to tolerance, and decrease the average residual norm by up to $7\times$ when stopping early.</p>

Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets. We furthermore derive the idealized ranking accuracy that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly. We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant alignment gap -- i.e., a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies. We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint. Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Byoungwoo Park, Jungwon Choi, Sungbin Lim, Juho Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models and diffusion bridges primarily focus on finite-dimensional spaces, yet many real-world problems necessitate operations in infinite-dimensional function spaces for more natural and interpretable formulations. In this paper, we present a theory of stochastic optimal control (SOC) tailored to infinite-dimensional spaces, aiming to extend diffusion-based algorithms to function spaces. Specifically, we demonstrate how Doob's $h$-transform, the fundamental tool for constructing diffusion bridges, can be derived from the SOC perspective and expanded to infinite dimensions. This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01163">When to Sense and Control? A Time-adaptive Approach for Continuous-Time RL</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lenart Treven, Bhavya Sukhija, Yarden As, Florian D\"orfler, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in optimizing policies for discrete-time Markov decision processes (MDP). However, various systems are inherently continuous in time, making discrete-time MDPs an inexact modeling choice. In many applications, such as greenhouse control or medical treatments, each interaction (measurement or switching of action) involves manual intervention and thus is inherently costly. Therefore, we generally prefer a time-adaptive approach with fewer interactions with the system. In this work, we formalize an RL framework, Time-adaptive Control & Sensing (TaCoS), that tackles this challenge by optimizing over policies that besides control predict the duration of its application. Our formulation results in an extended MDP that any standard RL algorithm can solve. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art RL algorithms trained on TaCoS drastically reduce the interaction amount over their discrete-time counterpart while retaining the same or improved performance, and exhibiting robustness over discretization frequency. Finally, we propose OTaCoS, an efficient model-based algorithm for our setting. We show that OTaCoS enjoys sublinear regret for systems with sufficiently smooth dynamics and empirically results in further sample-efficiency gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bhavya Sukhija, Lenart Treven, Florian D\"orfler, Stelian Coros, Andreas Krause</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of nonepisodic reinforcement learning (RL) for nonlinear dynamical systems, where the system dynamics are unknown and the RL agent has to learn from a single trajectory, i.e., without resets. We propose Nonepisodic Optimistic RL (NeoRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. NeoRL uses well-calibrated probabilistic models and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics. Under continuity and bounded energy assumptions on the system, we provide a first-of-its-kind regret bound of $\setO(\beta_T \sqrt{T \Gamma_T})$ for general nonlinear systems with Gaussian process dynamics. We compare NeoRL to other baselines on several deep RL environments and empirically demonstrate that NeoRL achieves the optimal average cost while incurring the least regret.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kairan Zhao, Meghdad Kurmanji, George-Octavian B\u{a}rbulescu, Eleni Triantafillou, Peter Triantafillou</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning is the problem of removing the effect of a subset of training data (the ''forget set'') from a trained model without damaging the model's utility e.g. to comply with users' requests to delete their data, or remove mislabeled, poisoned or otherwise problematic data. With unlearning research still being at its infancy, many fundamental open questions exist: Are there interpretable characteristics of forget sets that substantially affect the difficulty of the problem? How do these characteristics affect different state-of-the-art algorithms? With this paper, we present the first investigation aiming to answer these questions. We identify two key factors affecting unlearning difficulty and the performance of unlearning algorithms. Evaluation on forget sets that isolate these identified factors reveals previously-unknown behaviours of state-of-the-art algorithms that don't materialize on random forget sets. Based on our insights, we develop a framework coined Refined-Unlearning Meta-algorithm (RUM) that encompasses: (i) refining the forget set into homogenized subsets, according to different characteristics; and (ii) a meta-algorithm that employs existing algorithms to unlearn each subset and finally delivers a model that has unlearned the overall forget set. We find that RUM substantially improves top-performing unlearning algorithms. Overall, we view our work as an important step in (i) deepening our scientific understanding of unlearning and (ii) revealing new pathways to improving the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alaia Solko-Breslin, Seewon Choi, Ziyang Li, Neelay Velingker, Rajeev Alur, Mayur Naik, Eric Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Many computational tasks can be naturally expressed as a composition of a DNN followed by a program written in a traditional programming language or an API call to an LLM. We call such composites "neural programs" and focus on the problem of learning the DNN parameters when the training data consist of end-to-end input-output labels for the composite. When the program is written in a differentiable logic programming language, techniques from neurosymbolic learning are applicable, but in general, the learning for neural programs requires estimating the gradients of black-box components. We present an algorithm for learning neural programs, called ISED, that only relies on input-output samples of black-box components. For evaluation, we introduce new benchmarks that involve calls to modern LLMs such as GPT-4 and also consider benchmarks from the neurosymbolic learning literature. Our evaluation shows that for the latter benchmarks, ISED has comparable performance to state-of-the-art neurosymbolic frameworks. For the former, we use adaptations of prior work on gradient approximations of black-box components as a baseline, and show that ISED achieves comparable accuracy but in a more data- and sample-efficient manner.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuanjie Shi, Subhankar Ghosh, Taha Belkhouja, Janardhan Rao Doppa, Yan Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an emerging uncertainty quantification framework that allows us to construct a prediction set to cover the true label with a pre-specified marginal or conditional probability. Although the valid coverage guarantee has been extensively studied for classification problems, CP often produces large prediction sets which may not be practically useful. This issue is exacerbated for the setting of class-conditional coverage on imbalanced classification tasks with many and/or imbalanced classes. This paper proposes the Rank Calibrated Class-conditional CP (RC3P) algorithm to reduce the prediction set sizes to achieve class-conditional coverage, where the valid coverage holds for each class. In contrast to the standard class-conditional CP (CCP) method that uniformly thresholds the class-wise conformity score for each class, the augmented label rank calibration step allows RC3P to selectively iterate this class-wise thresholding subroutine only for a subset of classes whose class-wise top-k error is small. We prove that agnostic to the classifier and data distribution, RC3P achieves class-wise coverage. We also show that RC3P reduces the size of prediction sets compared to the CCP method. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that RC3P achieves class-wise coverage and 26.25% reduction in prediction set sizes on average.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyan Hu, Ho-fung Leung, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing frameworks for evaluating and comparing generative models typically target an offline setting, where the evaluator has access to full batches of data produced by the models. However, in many practical scenarios, the goal is to identify the best model using the fewest generated samples to minimize the costs of querying data from the models. Such an online comparison is challenging with current offline assessment methods. In this work, we propose an online evaluation framework to find the generative model that maximizes a standard assessment score among a group of available models. Our method uses an optimism-based multi-armed bandit framework to identify the model producing data with the highest evaluation score, quantifying the quality and diversity of generated data. Specifically, we study the online assessment of generative models based on the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) metrics and propose the FID-UCB and IS-UCB algorithms leveraging the upper confidence bound approach in online learning. We prove sub-linear regret bounds for these algorithms and present numerical results on standard image datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying the score-maximizing generative model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farnoush Rezaei Jafari, Gr\'egoire Montavon, Klaus-Robert M\"uller, Oliver Eberle</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent sequence modeling approaches using selective state space sequence models, referred to as Mamba models, have seen a surge of interest. These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering various biases and evaluating their significance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron J. Hadley, Christopher L. Pulliam</p>
<p>Abstract: The generalizability of machine learning (ML) models for wearable monitoring in stroke rehabilitation is often constrained by the limited scale and heterogeneity of available data. Data augmentation addresses this challenge by adding computationally derived data to real data to enrich the variability represented in the training set. Traditional augmentation methods, such as rotation, permutation, and time-warping, have shown some benefits in improving classifier performance, but often fail to produce realistic training examples. This study employs Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to create synthetic kinematic data from a publicly available dataset, closely mimicking the experimentally measured reaching movements of stroke survivors. This approach not only captures the complex temporal dynamics and common movement patterns after stroke, but also significantly enhances the training dataset. By training deep learning models on both synthetic and experimental data, we enhanced task classification accuracy: models incorporating synthetic data attained an overall accuracy of 80.0%, significantly higher than the 66.1% seen in models trained solely with real data. These improvements allow for more precise task classification, offering clinicians the potential to monitor patient progress more accurately and tailor rehabilitation interventions more effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in utilizing external tools and knowledge to boost accuracy and reduce hallucinations. However, developing prompting techniques that enable LLM agents to effectively use these tools and knowledge remains a heuristic and labor-intensive task. Here, we introduce AvaTaR, a novel and automated framework that optimizes an LLM agent to effectively leverage provided tools, improving performance on a given task. During optimization, we design a comparator module to iteratively deliver insightful and comprehensive prompts to the LLM agent by contrastively reasoning between positive and negative examples sampled from training data. We demonstrate AvaTaR on four complex multimodal retrieval datasets featuring textual, visual, and relational information, and three general question-answering (QA) datasets. We find AvaTaR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all seven tasks, exhibiting strong generalization ability when applied to novel cases and achieving an average relative improvement of 14% on the Hit@1 metric for the retrieval datasets and 13% for the QA datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andy Arditi, Oscar Obeso, Aaquib Syed, Daniel Paleka, Nina Panickssery, Wes Gurnee, Neel Nanda</p>
<p>Abstract: Conversational large language models are fine-tuned for both instruction-following and safety, resulting in models that obey benign requests but refuse harmful ones. While this refusal behavior is widespread across chat models, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, across 13 popular open-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, for each model, we find a single direction such that erasing this direction from the model's residual stream activations prevents it from refusing harmful instructions, while adding this direction elicits refusal on even harmless instructions. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel white-box jailbreak method that surgically disables refusal with minimal effect on other capabilities. Finally, we mechanistically analyze how adversarial suffixes suppress propagation of the refusal-mediating direction. Our findings underscore the brittleness of current safety fine-tuning methods. More broadly, our work showcases how an understanding of model internals can be leveraged to develop practical methods for controlling model behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Effective imputation is a crucial preprocessing step for time series analysis. Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

<p>Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks, spanning various applications in natural language processing and computer vision, is attributed to the critical role of self-attention. Similar to the development of most deep learning models, the construction of these attention mechanisms relies on heuristics and experience. In our work, we derive self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) and show that self-attention projects its query vectors onto the principal component axes of its key matrix in a feature space. We then formulate the exact formula for the value matrix in self-attention, theoretically and empirically demonstrating that this value matrix captures the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix of the key vectors in self-attention. Leveraging our kernel PCA framework, we propose Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention), a novel class of robust attention that is resilient to data contamination. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of RPC-Attention over softmax attention on the ImageNet-1K object classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, and ADE20K image segmentation task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Credit attribution is crucial across various fields. In academic research, proper citation acknowledges prior work and establishes original contributions. Similarly, in generative models, such as those trained on existing artworks or music, it is important to ensure that any generated content influenced by these works appropriately credits the original creators.
  We study credit attribution by machine learning algorithms. We propose new definitions--relaxations of Differential Privacy--that weaken the stability guarantees for a designated subset of $k$ datapoints. These $k$ datapoints can be used non-stably with permission from their owners, potentially in exchange for compensation. Meanwhile, the remaining datapoints are guaranteed to have no significant influence on the algorithm's output.
  Our framework extends well-studied notions of stability, including Differential Privacy ($k = 0$), differentially private learning with public data (where the $k$ public datapoints are fixed in advance), and stable sample compression (where the $k$ datapoints are selected adaptively by the algorithm). We examine the expressive power of these stability notions within the PAC learning framework, provide a comprehensive characterization of learnability for algorithms adhering to these principles, and propose directions and questions for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the context of escalating safety concerns across various domains, the tasks of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Video Anomaly Recognition (VAR) have emerged as critically important for applications in intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, violence alerting, etc. These tasks, aimed at identifying and classifying deviations from normal behavior in video data, face significant challenges due to the rarity of anomalies which leads to extremely imbalanced data and the impracticality of extensive frame-level data annotation for supervised learning. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.</p>

However, it is not directly applicable to Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to the inaccessibility of explicit action-value functions. We address this challenge by introducing a novel approach based on learning a world model of the environment using conditional mean embeddings. Leveraging tools from operator theory we derive a closed-form expression of the action-value function in terms of the world model via simple matrix operations. Combining these estimators with PMD leads to POWR, a new RL algorithm for which we prove convergence rates to the global optimum.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Xie, Raul Astudillo, Peter I. Frazier, Ziv Scully, Alexander Terenin</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a technique for efficiently optimizing unknown functions in a black-box manner. To handle practical settings where gathering data requires use of finite resources, it is desirable to explicitly incorporate function evaluation costs into Bayesian optimization policies. To understand how to do so, we develop a previously-unexplored connection between cost-aware Bayesian optimization and the Pandora's Box problem, a decision problem from economics. The Pandora's Box problem admits a Bayesian-optimal solution based on an expression called the Gittins index, which can be reinterpreted as an acquisition function. We study the use of this acquisition function for cost-aware Bayesian optimization, and demonstrate empirically that it performs well, particularly in medium-high dimensions. We further show that this performance carries over to classical Bayesian optimization without explicit evaluation costs. Our work constitutes a first step towards integrating techniques from Gittins index theory into Bayesian optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Qiu, Yang Zhang, Xuchuan Huang, Jasmine Xinze Li, Jiaming Ji, Yaodong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Frontier AI systems, including large language models (LLMs), hold increasing influence over the epistemology of human users. Such influence can reinforce prevailing societal values, potentially contributing to the lock-in of misguided moral beliefs and, consequently, the perpetuation of problematic moral practices on a broad scale. We introduce progress alignment as a technical solution to mitigate this imminent risk. Progress alignment algorithms learn to emulate the mechanics of human moral progress, thereby addressing the susceptibility of existing alignment methods to contemporary moral blindspots. To empower research in progress alignment, we introduce ProgressGym, an experimental framework allowing the learning of moral progress mechanics from history, in order to facilitate future progress in real-world moral decisions. Leveraging 9 centuries of historical text and 18 historical LLMs, ProgressGym enables codification of real-world progress alignment challenges into concrete benchmarks. Specifically, we introduce three core challenges: tracking evolving values (PG-Follow), preemptively anticipating moral progress (PG-Predict), and regulating the feedback loop between human and AI value shifts (PG-Coevolve). Alignment methods without a temporal dimension are inapplicable to these tasks. In response, we present lifelong and extrapolative algorithms as baseline methods of progress alignment, and build an open leaderboard soliciting novel algorithms and challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Wang, Shaofei Cai, Zhancun Mu, Haowei Lin, Ceyao Zhang, Xuejie Liu, Qing Li, Anji Liu, Xiaojian Ma, Yitao Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents OmniJARVIS, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for open-world instruction-following agents in Minecraft. Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories $\tau = \{o_0, a_0, \dots\}$ and an imitation learning policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language Models. With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions involving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual responses, behavior trajectories, etc into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing chain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior tokens for the imitation learning policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates excellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic, and open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the crucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization, and its scaling potentials. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://craftjarvis.org/OmniJARVIS.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00626">Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning of Diffusion Models with Energy-Based Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sangwoong Yoon, Himchan Hwang, Dohyun Kwon, Yung-Kyun Noh, Frank C. Park</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for improving the sample quality of diffusion generative models, especially when the number of generation time steps is small. Similar to how IRL trains a policy based on the reward function learned from expert demonstrations, we train (or fine-tune) a diffusion model using the log probability density estimated from training data. Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to represent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a diffusion model and an EBM. Our IRL formulation, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), is a minimax problem that reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The entropy maximization plays a key role in DxMI, facilitating the exploration of the diffusion model and ensuring the convergence of the EBM. We also propose Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion models, as a subroutine in DxMI. DxDP makes the diffusion model update in DxMI efficient by transforming the original problem into an optimal control formulation where value functions replace back-propagation in time. Our empirical studies show that diffusion models fine-tuned using DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 and 10 steps. Additionally, DxMI enables the training of an EBM without MCMC, stabilizing EBM training dynamics and enhancing anomaly detection performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Calvin Luo, Mandy He, Zilai Zeng, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Training an agent to achieve particular goals or perform desired behaviors is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, especially in the absence of expert demonstrations. However, supporting novel goals or behaviors through reinforcement learning requires the ad-hoc design of appropriate reward functions, which quickly becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning (TADPoLe), which uses a pretrained, frozen text-conditioned diffusion model to compute dense zero-shot reward signals for text-aligned policy learning. We hypothesize that large-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervise a policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignment with a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TADPoLe is able to learn policies for novel goal-achievement and continuous locomotion behaviors specified by natural language, in both Humanoid and Dog environments. The behaviors are learned zero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and are qualitatively more natural according to human evaluation. We further show that TADPoLe performs competitively when applied to robotic manipulation tasks in the Meta-World environment, without having access to any in-domain demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel activation function tailored specifically for graph data in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Motivated by the need for graph-adaptive and flexible activation functions, we introduce DiGRAF, leveraging Continuous Piecewise-Affine Based (CPAB) transformations, which we augment with an additional GNN to learn a graph-adaptive diffeomorphic activation function in an end-to-end manner. In addition to its graph-adaptivity and flexibility, DiGRAF also possesses properties that are widely recognized as desirable for activation functions, such as differentiability, boundness within the domain, and computational efficiency. We conduct an extensive set of experiments across diverse datasets and tasks, demonstrating a consistent and superior performance of DiGRAF compared to traditional and graph-specific activation functions, highlighting its effectiveness as an activation function for GNNs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Holzm\"uller, L\'eo Grinsztajn, Ingo Steinwart</p>
<p>Abstract: For classification and regression on tabular data, the dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) has recently been challenged by often much slower deep learning methods with extensive hyperparameter tuning. We address this discrepancy by introducing (a) RealMLP, an improved multilayer perceptron (MLP), and (b) strong meta-tuned default parameters for GBDTs and RealMLP. We tune RealMLP and the default parameters on a meta-train benchmark with 118 datasets and compare them to hyperparameter-optimized versions on a disjoint meta-test benchmark with 90 datasets, as well as the GBDT-friendly benchmark by Grinsztajn et al. (2022). Our benchmark results on medium-to-large tabular datasets (1K--500K samples) show that RealMLP offers a favorable time-accuracy tradeoff compared to other neural baselines and is competitive with GBDTs in terms of benchmark scores. Moreover, a combination of RealMLP and GBDTs with improved default parameters can achieve excellent results without hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we demonstrate that some of RealMLP's improvements can also considerably improve the performance of TabR with default parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tristan Cinquin, Marvin Pf\"ortner, Vincent Fortuin, Philipp Hennig, Robert Bamler</p>
<p>Abstract: Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the trained network, and they scale to large models and datasets. While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of the weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant (as is the case in many scientific inference tasks). At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box supervised learning problems, where neural networks typically excel.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL) which combines simulated annealing with MCL. MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous tasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are trained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity of the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily suboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this limitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis space during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and information theory to provide a detailed description of the model training trajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT), a simple and effective methodology for highly efficient and accurate LLM training with extremely long sequences. MsT partitions input sequences and iteratively processes mini-sequences to reduce intermediate memory usage. Integrated with activation recomputation, it enables significant memory savings in both forward and backward passes. In experiments with the Llama3-8B model, with MsT, we measure no degradation in throughput or convergence even with 12x longer sequences than standard implementations. MsT is fully general, implementation-agnostic, and requires minimal code changes to integrate with existing LLM training frameworks. Integrated with the huggingface library, MsT successfully extends the maximum context length of Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma-2 by 12-24x.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18480">Scalable Graph Compressed Convolutions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junshu Sun, Shuhui Wang, Chenxue Yang, Qingming Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing effective graph neural networks (GNNs) with message passing has two fundamental challenges, i.e., determining optimal message-passing pathways and designing local aggregators. Previous methods of designing optimal pathways are limited with information loss on the input features. On the other hand, existing local aggregators generally fail to extract multi-scale features and approximate diverse operators under limited parameter scales. In contrast to these methods, Euclidean convolution has been proven as an expressive aggregator, making it a perfect candidate for GNN construction. However, the challenges of generalizing Euclidean convolution to graphs arise from the irregular structure of graphs. To bridge the gap between Euclidean space and graph topology, we propose a differentiable method that applies permutations to calibrate input graphs for Euclidean convolution. The permutations constrain all nodes in a row regardless of their input order and therefore enable the flexible generalization of Euclidean convolution to graphs. Based on the graph calibration, we propose the Compressed Convolution Network (CoCN) for hierarchical graph representation learning. CoCN follows local feature-learning and global parameter-sharing mechanisms of convolution neural networks. The whole model can be trained end-to-end, with compressed convolution applied to learn individual node features and their corresponding structure features. CoCN can further borrow successful practices from Euclidean convolution, including residual connection and inception mechanism. We validate CoCN on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks. CoCN achieves superior performance over competitive GNN baselines. Codes are available at https://github.com/sunjss/CoCN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyuan Mao, Haoran Xu, Xianyuan Zhan, Weinan Zhang, Amy Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: One important property of DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods is that the solution is the optimal stationary distribution ratio between the optimized and data collection policy. In this work, we show that DICE-based methods can be viewed as a transformation from the behavior distribution to the optimal policy distribution. Based on this, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion-DICE, that directly performs this transformation using diffusion models. We find that the optimal policy's score function can be decomposed into two terms: the behavior policy's score function and the gradient of a guidance term which depends on the optimal distribution ratio. The first term can be obtained from a diffusion model trained on the dataset and we propose an in-sample learning objective to learn the second term. Due to the multi-modality contained in the optimal policy distribution, the transformation in Diffusion-DICE may guide towards those local-optimal modes. We thus generate a few candidate actions and carefully select from them to approach global-optimum. Different from all other diffusion-based offline RL methods, the guide-then-select paradigm in Diffusion-DICE only uses in-sample actions for training and brings minimal error exploitation in the value function. We use a didatic toycase example to show how previous diffusion-based methods fail to generate optimal actions due to leveraging these errors and how Diffusion-DICE successfully avoids that. We then conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to show the strong performance of Diffusion-DICE. Project page at https://ryanxhr.github.io/Diffusion-DICE/.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting anomalies or out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness not only in natural language processing but also in broader applications due to their advanced comprehension and generative capabilities. The integration of LLMs into anomaly and OOD detection marks a significant shift from the traditional paradigm in the field. This survey focuses on the problem of anomaly and OOD detection under the context of LLMs. We propose a new taxonomy to categorize existing approaches into two classes based on the role played by LLMs. Following our proposed taxonomy, we further discuss the related work under each of the categories and finally discuss potential challenges and directions for future research in this field. We also provide an up-to-date reading list of relevant papers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting relies on accurately capturing the correlations among variates. Current channel-independent (CI) models and models with a CI final projection layer are unable to capture these dependencies. In this paper, we present the variate embedding (VE) pipeline, which learns a unique and consistent embedding for each variate and combines it with Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to enhance forecasting performance while controlling parameter size. The VE pipeline can be integrated into any model with a CI final projection layer to improve multivariate forecasting. The learned VE effectively groups variates with similar temporal patterns and separates those with low correlations. The effectiveness of the VE pipeline is demonstrated through experiments on four widely-used datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/swang-song/VE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satyananda Kashyap, Niharika S. D'Souza, Luyao Shi, Ken C. L. Wong, Hongzhi Wang, Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.</p>

Our system demonstrates that a program synthesis system (DreamCoder) using MathDSL can generate programs that solve linear equations with greater accuracy and conciseness than using reinforcement learning systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that if we use the action spaces of previous reinforcement learning systems as DSLs, MathDSL outperforms the action-space-DSLs. We use DreamCoder to store equation-solving strategies as learned abstractions in its program library and demonstrate that by using MathDSL, these can be converted into human-interpretable solution strategies that could have applications in mathematical education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaochuan Gong, Jie Hao, Mingrui Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates a class of stochastic bilevel optimization problems where the upper-level function is nonconvex with potentially unbounded smoothness and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. These problems have significant applications in sequential data learning, such as text classification using recurrent neural networks. The unbounded smoothness is characterized by the smoothness constant of the upper-level function scaling linearly with the gradient norm, lacking a uniform upper bound. Existing state-of-the-art algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ oracle calls of stochastic gradient or Hessian/Jacobian-vector product to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. However, it remains unclear if we can further improve the convergence rate when the assumptions for the function in the population level also hold for each random realization almost surely (e.g., Lipschitzness of each realization of the stochastic gradient). To address this issue, we propose a new Accelerated Bilevel Optimization algorithm named AccBO. The algorithm updates the upper-level variable by normalized stochastic gradient descent with recursive momentum and the lower-level variable by the stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm with averaging. We prove that our algorithm achieves an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^3)$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Our proof relies on a novel lemma characterizing the dynamics of stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient descent algorithm under distribution drift with high probability for the lower-level variable, which is of independent interest and also plays a crucial role in analyzing the hypergradient estimation error over time. Experimental results on various tasks confirm that our proposed algorithm achieves the predicted theoretical acceleration and significantly outperforms baselines in bilevel optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora have shown remarkable success in knowledge-intensive tasks. Yet, most of them rely on pre-stored knowledge. Inducing new general knowledge from a specific environment and performing reasoning with the acquired knowledge -- \textit{situated inductive reasoning}, is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. In this paper, we design Mars, an interactive environment devised for situated inductive reasoning. It introduces counter-commonsense game mechanisms by modifying terrain, survival setting and task dependency while adhering to certain principles. In Mars, agents need to actively interact with their surroundings, derive useful rules and perform decision-making tasks in specific contexts. We conduct experiments on various RL-based and LLM-based methods, finding that they all struggle on this challenging situated inductive reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we explore \textit{Induction from Reflection}, where we instruct agents to perform inductive reasoning from history trajectory. The superior performance underscores the importance of inductive reasoning in Mars. Through Mars, we aim to galvanize advancements in situated inductive reasoning and set the stage for developing the next generation of AI systems that can reason in an adaptive and context-sensitive way.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukwon Yun, Inyoung Choi, Jie Peng, Yangfan Wu, Jingxuan Bao, Qiyiwen Zhang, Jiayi Xin, Qi Long, Tianlong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained increasing importance across various fields, offering the ability to integrate data from diverse sources such as images, text, and personalized records, which are frequently observed in medical domains. However, in scenarios where some modalities are missing, many existing frameworks struggle to accommodate arbitrary modality combinations, often relying heavily on a single modality or complete data. This oversight of potential modality combinations limits their applicability in real-world situations. To address this challenge, we propose Flex-MoE (Flexible Mixture-of-Experts), a new framework designed to flexibly incorporate arbitrary modality combinations while maintaining robustness to missing data. The core idea of Flex-MoE is to first address missing modalities using a new missing modality bank that integrates observed modality combinations with the corresponding missing ones. This is followed by a uniquely designed Sparse MoE framework. Specifically, Flex-MoE first trains experts using samples with all modalities to inject generalized knowledge through the generalized router ($\mathcal{G}$-Router). The $\mathcal{S}$-Router then specializes in handling fewer modality combinations by assigning the top-1 gate to the expert corresponding to the observed modality combination. We evaluate Flex-MoE on the ADNI dataset, which encompasses four modalities in the Alzheimer's Disease domain, as well as on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Flex-MoE highlighting its ability to model arbitrary modality combinations in diverse missing modality scenarios.

<p>Abstract: We propose a self-supervised learning method for 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, named ECG Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (ECG-JEPA). ECG-JEPA employs a masking strategy to learn semantic representations of ECG data. Unlike existing methods, ECG-JEPA predicts at the hidden representation level rather than reconstructing raw data. This approach offers several advantages in the ECG domain: (1) it avoids producing unnecessary details, such as noise, which is common in standard ECG; and (2) it addresses the limitations of na\"ive L2 loss between raw signals. Another key contribution is the introduction of a special masked attention tailored for 12-lead ECG data, Cross-Pattern Attention (CroPA). CroPA enables the model to effectively capture inter-patch relationships. Additionally, ECG-JEPA is highly scalable, allowing efficient training on large datasets.

<p>Abstract: In this work, we explore the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that were not encountered during training. To achieve this, we conduct synthetic experiments where the objective is to learn OOD mathematical functions through ICL using a GPT-2 model. We reveal that Transformers may struggle to learn OOD task functions through ICL. Specifically, ICL performance resembles implementing a function within the pretraining hypothesis space and optimizing it with gradient descent based on the in-context examples. Additionally, we investigate ICL's well-documented ability to learn unseen abstract labels in context. We demonstrate that such ability only manifests in the scenarios without distributional shifts and, therefore, may not serve as evidence of new-task-learning ability. Furthermore, we assess ICL's performance on OOD tasks when the model is pretrained on multiple tasks. Both empirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate the existence of the \textbf{low-test-error preference} of ICL, where it tends to implement the pretraining function that yields low test error in the testing context. We validate this through numerical experiments. This new theoretical result, combined with our empirical findings, elucidates the mechanism of ICL in addressing OOD tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan Sebastian Rojas, Chi-Guhn Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, average-reward MDPs have remained largely unexplored in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, with the majority of RL-based efforts having been allocated to episodic and discounted MDPs. In this work, we study a unique structural property of average-reward MDPs and utilize it to introduce Reward-Extended Differential (or RED) reinforcement learning: a novel RL framework that can be used to effectively and efficiently solve various subtasks simultaneously in the average-reward setting. We introduce a family of RED learning algorithms for prediction and control, including proven-convergent algorithms for the tabular case. We then showcase the power of these algorithms by demonstrating how they can be used to learn a policy that optimizes, for the first time, the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) risk measure in a fully-online manner, without the use of an explicit bi-level optimization scheme or an augmented state-space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jintao Zhang, Mingyue Cheng, Xiaoyu Tao, Zhiding Liu, Daoyu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data of its decomposed trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and highlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bryan L. M. de Oliveira, Murilo L. da Luz, Bruno Brand\~ao, Luana G. B. Martins, Telma W. de L. Soares, Luckeciano C. Melo</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning effective visual representations is crucial in open-world environments where agents encounter diverse and unstructured observations. This ability enables agents to extract meaningful information from raw sensory inputs, like pixels, which is essential for generalization across different tasks. However, evaluating representation learning separately from policy learning remains a challenge in most reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks. To address this, we introduce the Sliding Puzzles Gym (SPGym), a benchmark that extends the classic 15-tile puzzle with variable grid sizes and observation spaces, including large real-world image datasets. SPGym allows scaling the representation learning challenge while keeping the latent environment dynamics and algorithmic problem fixed, providing a targeted assessment of agents' ability to form compositional and generalizable state representations. Our experiments with both model-free and model-based RL algorithms, with and without explicit representation learning components, show that as the representation challenge scales, SPGym effectively distinguishes agents based on their capabilities. Moreover, SPGym reaches difficulty levels where no tested algorithm consistently excels, highlighting key challenges and opportunities for advancing representation learning for decision-making research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuval Ran-Milo, Eden Lumbroso, Edo Cohen-Karlik, Raja Giryes, Amir Globerson, Nadav Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter A. Wijeratne, Daniel C. Alexander</p>
<p>Abstract: Disease progression models infer group-level temporal trajectories of change in patients' features as a chronic degenerative condition plays out. They provide unique insight into disease biology and staging systems with individual-level clinical utility. Discrete models consider disease progression as a latent permutation of events, where each event corresponds to a feature becoming measurably abnormal. However, permutation inference using traditional maximum likelihood approaches becomes prohibitive due to combinatoric explosion, severely limiting model dimensionality and utility. Here we leverage ideas from optimal transport to model disease progression as a latent permutation matrix of events belonging to the Birkhoff polytope, facilitating fast inference via optimisation of the variational lower bound. This enables a factor of 1000 times faster inference than the current state of the art and, correspondingly, supports models with several orders of magnitude more features than the current state of the art can consider. Experiments demonstrate the increase in speed, accuracy and robustness to noise in simulation. Further experiments with real-world imaging data from two separate datasets, one from Alzheimer's disease patients, the other age-related macular degeneration, showcase, for the first time, pixel-level disease progression events in the brain and eye, respectively. Our method is low compute, interpretable and applicable to any progressive condition and data modality, giving it broad potential clinical utility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Oscar Yin, Alexander M. Rush</p>
<p>Abstract: Data selection can reduce the amount of training data needed to finetune LLMs; however, the efficacy of data selection scales directly with its compute. Motivated by the practical challenge of compute-constrained finetuning, we consider the setting in which both the cost of selecting data and training are budgeted for. We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. These experiments show the validity of this model in real-world experiments. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yixiu Mao, Qi Wang, Chen Chen, Yun Qu, Xiangyang Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), addressing the out-of-distribution (OOD) action issue has been a focus, but we argue that there exists an OOD state issue that also impairs performance yet has been underexplored. Such an issue describes the scenario when the agent encounters states out of the offline dataset during the test phase, leading to uncontrolled behavior and performance degradation. To this end, we propose SCAS, a simple yet effective approach that unifies OOD state correction and OOD action suppression in offline RL. Technically, SCAS achieves value-aware OOD state correction, capable of correcting the agent from OOD states to high-value in-distribution states. Theoretical and empirical results show that SCAS also exhibits the effect of suppressing OOD actions. On standard offline RL benchmarks, SCAS achieves excellent performance without additional hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, benefiting from its OOD state correction feature, SCAS demonstrates enhanced robustness against environmental perturbations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Franklin Wang, Sumanth Hegde</p>
<p>Abstract: Offline paired preference optimization algorithms have become a popular approach for fine-tuning on preference data, outperforming traditional supervised fine-tuning in various tasks. However, traditional implementations often involve redundant computations, especially for tasks with long shared prompts. We introduce prefix sharing for preference tuning, a novel technique that processes chosen and rejected responses as one sequence with a shared prefix. To prevent cross-response contamination, we use a custom block-sparse attention mask. Our method achieves $1.1$-$1.5\times$ improvement in training throughput on popular DPO datasets, without any effect on convergence. When combined with sequence packing, we observe consistent $1.3$-$1.6\times$ speedups, benefiting even datasets with smaller sequence lengths. While we focus on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), our approach is applicable to other paired preference tuning methods. By enhancing computational efficiency, our work contributes to making preference-based fine-tuning more accessible for a wider range of applications and model sizes.

<p>Abstract: Online shopping is a complex multi-task, few-shot learning problem with a wide and evolving range of entities, relations, and tasks. However, existing models and benchmarks are commonly tailored to specific tasks, falling short of capturing the full complexity of online shopping. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their multi-task and few-shot learning abilities, have the potential to profoundly transform online shopping by alleviating task-specific engineering efforts and by providing users with interactive conversations. Despite the potential, LLMs face unique challenges in online shopping, such as domain-specific concepts, implicit knowledge, and heterogeneous user behaviors. Motivated by the potential and challenges, we propose Shopping MMLU, a diverse multi-task online shopping benchmark derived from real-world Amazon data. Shopping MMLU consists of 57 tasks covering 4 major shopping skills: concept understanding, knowledge reasoning, user behavior alignment, and multi-linguality, and can thus comprehensively evaluate the abilities of LLMs as general shop assistants. With Shopping MMLU, we benchmark over 20 existing LLMs and uncover valuable insights about practices and prospects of building versatile LLM-based shop assistants. Shopping MMLU can be publicly accessed at https://github.com/KL4805/ShoppingMMLU. In addition, with Shopping MMLU, we host a competition in KDD Cup 2024 with over 500 participating teams.

<p>Abstract: We develop a generic policy gradient method with the global optimality guarantee for robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While policy gradient methods are widely used for solving dynamic decision problems due to their scalable and efficient nature, adapting these methods to account for model ambiguity has been challenging, often making it impractical to learn robust policies. This paper introduces a novel policy gradient method, Double-Loop Robust Policy Mirror Descent (DRPMD), for solving robust MDPs. DRPMD employs a general mirror descent update rule for the policy optimization with adaptive tolerance per iteration, guaranteeing convergence to a globally optimal policy. We provide a comprehensive analysis of DRPMD, including new convergence results under both direct and softmax parameterizations, and provide novel insights into the inner problem solution through Transition Mirror Ascent (TMA). Additionally, we propose innovative parametric transition kernels for both discrete and continuous state-action spaces, broadening the applicability of our approach. Empirical results validate the robustness and global convergence of DRPMD across various challenging robust MDP settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raymond Chua, Arna Ghosh, Christos Kaplanis, Blake A. Richards, Doina Precup</p>
<p>Abstract: In Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is a challenge to learn representations that do not exhibit catastrophic forgetting or interference in non-stationary environments. Successor Features (SFs) offer a potential solution to this challenge. However, canonical techniques for learning SFs from pixel-level observations often lead to representation collapse, wherein representations degenerate and fail to capture meaningful variations in the data. More recent methods for learning SFs can avoid representation collapse, but they often involve complex losses and multiple learning phases, reducing their efficiency. We introduce a novel, simple method for learning SFs directly from pixels. Our approach uses a combination of a Temporal-difference (TD) loss and a reward prediction loss, which together capture the basic mathematical definition of SFs. We show that our approach matches or outperforms existing SF learning techniques in both 2D (Minigrid), 3D (Miniworld) mazes and Mujoco, for both single and continual learning scenarios. As well, our technique is efficient, and can reach higher levels of performance in less time than other approaches. Our work provides a new, streamlined technique for learning SFs directly from pixel observations, with no pretraining required.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guande He, Kaiwen Zheng, Jianfei Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become the dominant paradigm of generative modeling in a variety of domains by learning stochastic processes from noise to data. Recently, diffusion denoising bridge models (DDBMs), a new formulation of generative modeling that builds stochastic processes between fixed data endpoints based on a reference diffusion process, have achieved empirical success across tasks with coupled data distribution, such as image-to-image translation. However, DDBM's sampling process typically requires hundreds of network evaluations to achieve decent performance, which may impede their practical deployment due to high computational demands. In this work, inspired by the recent advance of consistency models in DMs, we tackle this problem by learning the consistency function of the probability-flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) of DDBMs, which directly predicts the solution at a starting step given any point on the ODE trajectory. Based on a dedicated general-form ODE solver, we propose two paradigms: consistency bridge distillation and consistency bridge training, which is flexible to apply on DDBMs with broad design choices. Experimental results show that our proposed method could sample $4\times$ to $50\times$ faster than the base DDBM and produce better visual quality given the same step in various tasks with pixel resolution ranging from $64 \times 64$ to $256 \times 256$, as well as supporting downstream tasks such as semantic interpolation in the data space.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoyang Liu, Jie Wang, Wanbo Zhang, Zijie Geng, Yufei Kuang, Xijun Li, Bin Li, Yongdong Zhang, Feng Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the most popular mathematical formulations with numerous applications. In practice, improving the performance of MILP solvers often requires a large amount of high-quality data, which can be challenging to collect. Researchers thus turn to generation techniques to generate additional MILP instances. However, existing approaches do not take into account specific block structures -- which are closely related to the problem formulations -- in the constraint coefficient matrices (CCMs) of MILPs. Consequently, they are prone to generate computationally trivial or infeasible instances due to the disruptions of block structures and thus problem formulations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel MILP generation framework, called Block Structure Decomposition (MILP-StuDio), to generate high-quality instances by preserving the block structures. Specifically, MILP-StuDio begins by identifying the blocks in CCMs and decomposing the instances into block units, which serve as the building blocks of MILP instances. We then design three operators to construct new instances by removing, substituting, and appending block units in the original instances, enabling us to generate instances with flexible sizes. An appealing feature of MILP-StuDio is its strong ability to preserve the feasibility and computational hardness of the generated instances. Experiments on the commonly-used benchmarks demonstrate that using instances generated by MILP-StuDio is able to significantly reduce over 10% of the solving time for learning-based solvers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Navyansh Mahla, Ganesh Ramakrishnan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision data. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their performance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data that cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing. However, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL, particularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In this paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of popular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to constrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous analytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight averaging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance for fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison exposes inefficiencies in LoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We extend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used during local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore is a more effective alternative, outperforming federated LoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities. While privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing performance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL frameworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings advocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way for more efficient training methodologies.</p>

<p>Abstract: The hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) are increasingly mitigated by allowing LLMs to search for information and to ground their answers in real sources. Unfortunately, LLMs often struggle with posing the right search queries, especially when dealing with complex or otherwise indirect topics. Observing that LLMs can learn to search for relevant facts by $\textit{trying}$ different queries and learning to up-weight queries that successfully produce relevant results, we introduce $\underline{Le}$arning to $\underline{Re}$trieve by $\underline{T}$rying (LeReT), a reinforcement learning framework that explores search queries and uses preference-based optimization to improve their quality. LeReT can improve the absolute retrieval accuracy by up to 29% and the downstream generator evaluations by 17%. The simplicity and flexibility of LeReT allows it to be applied to arbitrary off-the-shelf retrievers and makes it a promising technique for improving general LLM pipelines.

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23227">(FL)$^2$: Overcoming Few Labels in Federated Semi-Supervised Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungjoo Lee, Thanh-Long V. Le, Jaemin Shin, Sung-Ju Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that trains accurate global models while preserving clients' privacy-sensitive data. However, most FL approaches assume that clients possess labeled data, which is often not the case in practice. Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) addresses this label deficiency problem, targeting situations where only the server has a small amount of labeled data while clients do not. However, a significant performance gap exists between Centralized Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and FSSL. This gap arises from confirmation bias, which is more pronounced in FSSL due to multiple local training epochs and the separation of labeled and unlabeled data. We propose $(FL)^2$, a robust training method for unlabeled clients using sharpness-aware consistency regularization. We show that regularizing the original pseudo-labeling loss is suboptimal, and hence we carefully select unlabeled samples for regularization. We further introduce client-specific adaptive thresholding and learning status-aware aggregation to adjust the training process based on the learning progress of each client. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance and bridges the gap with SSL, particularly in scenarios with scarce labeled data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Geoffrey Wolfer, Pierre Alquier</p>
<p>Abstract: An important feature of kernel mean embeddings (KME) is that the rate of convergence of the empirical KME to the true distribution KME can be bounded independently of the dimension of the space, properties of the distribution and smoothness features of the kernel. We show how to speed-up convergence by leveraging variance information in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Furthermore, we show that even when such information is a priori unknown, we can efficiently estimate it from the data, recovering the desiderata of a distribution agnostic bound that enjoys acceleration in fortuitous settings. We further extend our results from independent data to stationary mixing sequences and illustrate our methods in the context of hypothesis testing and robust parametric estimation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuetong Wu, Jonathan H. Manton, Uwe Aickelin, Jingge Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The generalization error of a learning algorithm refers to the discrepancy between the loss of a learning algorithm on training data and that on unseen testing data. Various information-theoretic bounds on the generalization error have been derived in the literature, where the mutual information between the training data and the hypothesis (the output of the learning algorithm) plays an important role. Focusing on the individual sample mutual information bound by Bu et al., which itself is a tightened version of the first bound on the topic by Russo et al. and Xu et al., this paper investigates the tightness of these bounds, in terms of the dependence of their convergence rates on the sample size $n$. It has been recognized that these bounds are in general not tight, readily verified for the exemplary quadratic Gaussian mean estimation problem, where the individual sample mutual information bound scales as $O(\sqrt{1/n})$ while the true generalization error scales as $O(1/n)$. The first contribution of this paper is to show that the same bound can in fact be asymptotically tight if an appropriate assumption is made. In particular, we show that the fast rate can be recovered when the assumption is made on the excess risk instead of the loss function, which was usually done in existing literature. A theoretical justification is given for this choice. The second contribution of the paper is a new set of generalization error bounds based on the $(\eta, c)$-central condition, a condition relatively easy to verify and has the property that the mutual information term directly determines the convergence rate of the bound. Several analytical and numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of these bounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuechen Guo, Wenhao Hu, Chiming Ni, Wenhao Chai, Shiyan Li, Gaoang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical images often incorporate doctor-added markers that can hinder AI-based diagnosis. This issue highlights the need of inpainting techniques to restore the corrupted visual contents. However, existing methods require manual mask annotation as input, limiting the application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel blind inpainting method that automatically reconstructs visual contents within the corrupted regions without mask input as guidance. Our model includes a blind reconstruction network and an object-aware discriminator for adversarial training. The reconstruction network contains two branches that predict corrupted regions in images and simultaneously restore the missing visual contents. Leveraging the potent recognition capability of a dense object detector, the object-aware discriminator ensures markers undetectable after inpainting. Thus, the restored images closely resemble the clean ones. We evaluate our method on three datasets of various medical imaging modalities, confirming better performance over other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Ablin, Simon Vary, Bin Gao, P. -A. Absil</p>
<p>Abstract: Orthogonality constraints naturally appear in many machine learning problems, from principal component analysis to robust neural network training. They are usually solved using Riemannian optimization algorithms, which minimize the objective function while enforcing the constraint. However, enforcing the orthogonality constraint can be the most time-consuming operation in such algorithms. Recently, Ablin & Peyr\'e (2022) proposed the landing algorithm, a method with cheap iterations that does not enforce the orthogonality constraints but is attracted towards the manifold in a smooth manner. This article provides new practical and theoretical developments for the landing algorithm. First, the method is extended to the Stiefel manifold, the set of rectangular orthogonal matrices. We also consider stochastic and variance reduction algorithms when the cost function is an average of many functions. We demonstrate that all these methods have the same rate of convergence as their Riemannian counterparts that exactly enforce the constraint, and converge to the manifold. Finally, our experiments demonstrate the promise of our approach to an array of machine-learning problems that involve orthogonality constraints.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14161">Revisiting Subgradient Method: Complexity and Convergence Beyond Lipschitz Continuity</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Li, Lei Zhao, Daoli Zhu, Anthony Man-Cho So</p>
<p>Abstract: The subgradient method is one of the most fundamental algorithmic schemes for nonsmooth optimization. The existing complexity and convergence results for this method are mainly derived for Lipschitz continuous objective functions. In this work, we first extend the typical iteration complexity results for the subgradient method to cover non-Lipschitz convex and weakly convex minimization. Specifically, for the convex case, we can drive the suboptimality gap to below $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}( \varepsilon^{-2} )$ iterations; for the weakly convex case, we can drive the gradient norm of the Moreau envelope of the objective function to below $\varepsilon$ in $\mathcal{O}( \varepsilon^{-4} )$ iterations. Then, we provide convergence results for the subgradient method in the non-Lipschitz setting when proper diminishing rules on the step size are used. In particular, when $f$ is convex, we establish an $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)/\sqrt{k})$ rate of convergence in terms of the suboptimality gap, where $k$ represents the iteration count. With an additional quadratic growth property, the rate is improved to $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ in terms of the squared distance to the optimal solution set. When $f$ is weakly convex, asymptotic convergence is established. Our results neither require any modification to the subgradient method nor impose any growth condition on the subgradients, while our analysis is surprisingly simple. To further illustrate the wide applicability of our framework, we extend the aforementioned iteration complexity results to cover the truncated subgradient, the stochastic subgradient, and the proximal subgradient methods for non-Lipschitz convex / weakly convex objective functions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Wu, Yujian Betterest Li, Jian Lou, Xiaoyu Zhang, Handing Wang, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: In the realm of daily services, the deployment of deep neural networks underscores the paramount importance of their reliability. However, the vulnerability of these networks to adversarial attacks, primarily evasion-based, poses a concerning threat to their functionality. Common methods for enhancing robustness involve heavy adversarial training or leveraging learned knowledge from clean data, both necessitating substantial computational resources. This inherent time-intensive nature severely limits the agility of large foundational models to swiftly counter adversarial perturbations. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the Rapid Plug-in Defender (RaPiD) problem, aiming to rapidly counter adversarial perturbations without altering the deployed model. Drawing inspiration from the generalization and the universal computation ability of pre-trained transformer models, we propose a novel method termed CeTaD (Considering Pre-trained Transformers as Defenders) for RaPiD, optimized for efficient computation. CeTaD strategically fine-tunes the normalization layer parameters within the defender using a limited set of clean and adversarial examples. Our evaluation centers on assessing CeTaD's effectiveness, transferability, and the impact of different components in scenarios involving one-shot adversarial examples. The proposed method is capable of rapidly adapting to various attacks and different application scenarios without altering the target model and clean training data. We also explore the influence of varying training data conditions on CeTaD's performance. Notably, CeTaD exhibits adaptability across differentiable service models and proves the potential of continuous learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Victor Yon, Fr\'ed\'eric Marcotte, Pierre-Antoine Mouny, Gebremedhin A. Dagnew, Bohdan Kulchytskyy, Sophie Rochette, Yann Beilliard, Dominique Drouin, Pooya Ronagh</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural decoders for quantum error correction (QEC) rely on neural networks to classify syndromes extracted from error correction codes and find appropriate recovery operators to protect logical information against errors. Its ability to adapt to hardware noise and long-term drifts make neural decoders a promising candidate for inclusion in a fault-tolerant quantum architecture. However, given their limited scalability, it is prudent that small-scale (local) neural decoders are treated as first stages of multi-stage decoding schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits. In this case, minimizing the decoding time to match the stabilization measurements frequency and a tight co-integration with the QPUs is highly desired. Cryogenic realizations of neural decoders can not only improve the performance of higher stage decoders, but they can minimize communication delays, and alleviate wiring bottlenecks. In this work, we design and analyze a neural decoder based on an in-memory computation (IMC) architecture, where crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices are employed to both store the synaptic weights of the neural decoder and perform analog matrix-vector multiplications. In simulations supported by experimental measurements, we investigate the impact of TiOx-based memristive devices' non-idealities on decoding fidelity. We develop hardware-aware re-training methods to mitigate the fidelity loss, restoring the ideal decoder's pseudo-threshold for the distance-3 surface code. This work provides a pathway to scalable, fast, and low-power cryogenic IMC hardware for integrated fault-tolerant QEC.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuma Ichikawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised learning (UL)-based solvers for combinatorial optimization (CO) train a neural network that generates a soft solution by directly optimizing the CO objective using a continuous relaxation strategy. These solvers offer several advantages over traditional methods and other learning-based methods, particularly for large-scale CO problems. However, UL-based solvers face two practical issues: (I) an optimization issue, where UL-based solvers are easily trapped at local optima, and (II) a rounding issue, where UL-based solvers require artificial post-learning rounding from the continuous space back to the original discrete space, undermining the robustness of the results. This study proposes a Continuous Relaxation Annealing (CRA) strategy, an effective rounding-free learning method for UL-based solvers. CRA introduces a penalty term that dynamically shifts from prioritizing continuous solutions, effectively smoothing the non-convexity of the objective function, to enforcing discreteness, eliminating artificial rounding. Experimental results demonstrate that CRA significantly enhances the performance of UL-based solvers, outperforming existing UL-based solvers and greedy algorithms in complex CO problems. Additionally, CRA effectively eliminates artificial rounding and accelerates the learning process.</p>

Ours is the first result in any structured setting not to require the size of the ensemble to scale linearly with $T$ -- which defeats the purpose of ensemble sampling -- while obtaining near $\smash{\sqrt{T}}$ order regret. Ours is also the first result that allows infinite action sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thangarajah Akilan, Hrishikesh Vachhani</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian detection has become a cornerstone for several high-level tasks, including autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and traffic surveillance. There are several works focussed on pedestrian detection using visible images, mainly in the daytime. However, this task is very intriguing when the environmental conditions change to poor lighting or nighttime. Recently, new ideas have been spurred to use alternative sources, such as Far InfraRed (FIR) temperature sensor feeds for detecting pedestrians in low-light conditions. This study reviews recent developments in low-light pedestrian detection approaches. It systematically categorizes and analyses various algorithms from region-based to non-region-based and graph-based learning methodologies by highlighting their methodologies, implementation issues, and challenges. It also outlines the key benchmark datasets that can be used for research and development of advanced pedestrian detection algorithms, particularly in low-light situations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christoph H\"ummer, Manuel Schwonberg, Liangwei Zhou, Hu Cao, Alois Knoll, Hanno Gottschalk</p>
<p>Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) remains a significant challenge for perception based on deep neural networks (DNNs), where domain shifts occur due to synthetic data, lighting, weather, or location changes. Vision-language models (VLMs) marked a large step for the generalization capabilities and have been already applied to various tasks. Very recently, first approaches utilized VLMs for domain generalized segmentation and object detection and obtained strong generalization. However, all these approaches rely on complex modules, feature augmentation frameworks or additional models. Surprisingly and in contrast to that, we found that simple fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models yields competitive or even stronger generalization results while being extremely simple to apply. Moreover, we found that vision-language pre-training consistently provides better generalization than the previous standard of vision-only pre-training. This challenges the standard of using ImageNet-based transfer learning for domain generalization. Fully fine-tuning a vision-language pre-trained model is capable of reaching the domain generalization SOTA when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. Moreover, we confirm this observation for object detection on a novel synthetic-to-real benchmark. We further obtain superior generalization capabilities by reaching 77.9% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark. We also found improved in-domain generalization, leading to an improved SOTA of 86.4% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set marking the first place on the leaderboard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felipe Maia Polo, Subha Maity, Mikhail Yurochkin, Moulinath Banerjee, Yuekai Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS) enables supervised model training without direct access to ground truth labels, utilizing weak labels from heuristics, crowdsourcing, or pre-trained models. However, the absence of ground truth complicates model evaluation, as traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall cannot be directly calculated. In this work, we present a novel method to address this challenge by framing model evaluation as a partial identification problem and estimating performance bounds using Fr\'echet bounds. Our approach derives reliable bounds on key metrics without requiring labeled data, overcoming core limitations in current weak supervision evaluation techniques. Through scalable convex optimization, we obtain accurate and computationally efficient bounds for metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, even in high-dimensional settings. This framework offers a robust approach to assessing model quality without ground truth labels, enhancing the practicality of weakly supervised learning for real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Yang, Yingzhe Peng, Haoxuan Ma, Shuo Xu, Chi Zhang, Yucheng Han, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: As Archimedes famously said, ``Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world'', in this study, we propose to use a tiny Language Model (LM), \eg, a Transformer with 67M parameters, to lever much larger Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with 9B parameters. Specifically, we use this tiny \textbf{Lever-LM} to configure effective in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences to improve the In-Context Learinng (ICL) performance of LVLMs. Previous studies show that diverse ICD configurations like the selection and ordering of the demonstrations heavily affect the ICL performance, highlighting the significance of configuring effective ICD sequences. Motivated by this and by re-considering the the process of configuring ICD sequence, we find this is a mirror process of human sentence composition and further assume that effective ICD configurations may contain internal statistical patterns that can be captured by Lever-LM. Then a dataset with effective ICD sequences is constructed to train Lever-LM. After training, given novel queries, new ICD sequences are configured by the trained Lever-LM to solve vision-language tasks through ICL. Experiments show that these ICD sequences can improve the ICL performance of two LVLMs compared with some strong baselines in Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning, validating that Lever-LM can really capture the statistical patterns for levering LVLMs. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ForJadeForest/Lever-LM}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Young Joo Han, Ha-Jin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing real sRGB noise is crucial for various low-level vision tasks, such as building datasets for training image denoising systems. The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We combine pixel-wise noise modeling networks based on Normalizing Flows and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. Specifically, the pixel-wise noise modeling network leverages the high training stability of Normalizing Flows to capture noise characteristics that are affected by a multitude of factors, and the spatial correlation networks efficiently model pixel-to-pixel relationships. In particular, unlike recent methods that rely on paired noisy images, our method synthesizes noise using clean images and factors that affect noise characteristics, such as easily obtainable parameters like camera type and ISO settings, making it applicable to various fields where obtaining noisy-clean image pairs is not feasible. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines in the sRGB noise synthesis task. Moreover, the denoising neural network trained with synthesized image pairs from our model shows superior performance compared to other baselines.

<p>Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is pivotal in human cognition and especially important for providing explanations and making decisions. While Judea Pearl's influential approach is theoretically elegant, its generation of a counterfactual scenario often requires too much deviation from the observed scenarios to be feasible, as we show using simple examples. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a framework of \emph{natural counterfactuals} and a method for generating counterfactuals that are more feasible with respect to the actual data distribution. Our methodology incorporates a certain amount of backtracking when needed, allowing changes in causally preceding variables to minimize deviations from realistic scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization framework that permits but also controls the extent of backtracking with a naturalness criterion. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/GuangyuanHao/natural_counterfactuals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Phuong Tran, The Anh Ta, Shuqing Shi, Debmalya Mandal, Yali Du, Long Tran-Thanh</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward allocation, also known as the credit assignment problem, has been an important topic in economics, engineering, and machine learning. An important concept in reward allocation is the core, which is the set of stable allocations where no agent has the motivation to deviate from the grand coalition. In previous works, computing the core requires either knowledge of the reward function in deterministic games or the reward distribution in stochastic games. However, this is unrealistic, as the reward function or distribution is often only partially known and may be subject to uncertainty. In this paper, we consider the core learning problem in stochastic cooperative games, where the reward distribution is unknown. Our goal is to learn the expected core, that is, the set of allocations that are stable in expectation, given an oracle that returns a stochastic reward for an enquired coalition each round. Within the class of strictly convex games, we present an algorithm named \texttt{Common-Points-Picking} that returns a point in the expected core given a polynomial number of samples, with high probability. To analyse the algorithm, we develop a new extension of the separation hyperplane theorem for multiple convex sets.</p>

<p>Abstract: In machine learning, model calibration and predictive inference are essential for producing reliable predictions and quantifying uncertainty to support decision-making. Recognizing the complementary roles of point and interval predictions, we introduce Self-Calibrating Conformal Prediction, a method that combines Venn-Abers calibration and conformal prediction to deliver calibrated point predictions alongside prediction intervals with finite-sample validity conditional on these predictions. To achieve this, we extend the original Venn-Abers procedure from binary classification to regression. Our theoretical framework supports analyzing conformal prediction methods that involve calibrating model predictions and subsequently constructing conditionally valid prediction intervals on the same data, where the conditioning set or conformity scores may depend on the calibrated predictions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew V Macfarlane, Edan Toledo, Donal Byrne, Paul Duckworth, Alexandre Laterre</p>
<p>Abstract: Leveraging planning during learning and decision-making is central to the long-term development of intelligent agents. Recent works have successfully combined tree-based search methods and self-play learning mechanisms to this end. However, these methods typically face scaling challenges due to the sequential nature of their search. While practical engineering solutions can partly overcome this, they often result in a negative impact on performance. In this paper, we introduce SPO: Sequential Monte Carlo Policy Optimisation, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm grounded within the Expectation Maximisation (EM) framework. We show that SPO provides robust policy improvement and efficient scaling properties. The sample-based search makes it directly applicable to both discrete and continuous action spaces without modifications. We demonstrate statistically significant improvements in performance relative to model-free and model-based baselines across both continuous and discrete environments. Furthermore, the parallel nature of SPO's search enables effective utilisation of hardware accelerators, yielding favourable scaling laws.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vahid Majdinasab, Amin Nikanjam, Foutse Khomh</p>
<p>Abstract: Code auditing ensures that the developed code adheres to standards, regulations, and copyright protection by verifying that it does not contain code from protected sources. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding assistants in the software development process poses new challenges for code auditing. The dataset for training these models is mainly collected from publicly available sources. This raises the issue of intellectual property infringement as developers' codes are already included in the dataset. Therefore, auditing code developed using LLMs is challenging, as it is difficult to reliably assert if an LLM used during development has been trained on specific copyrighted codes, given that we do not have access to the training datasets of these models. Given the non-disclosure of the training datasets, traditional approaches such as code clone detection are insufficient for asserting copyright infringement. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach, TraWiC; a model-agnostic and interpretable method based on membership inference for detecting code inclusion in an LLM's training dataset. We extract syntactic and semantic identifiers unique to each program to train a classifier for detecting code inclusion. In our experiments, we observe that TraWiC is capable of detecting 83.87% of codes that were used to train an LLM. In comparison, the prevalent clone detection tool NiCad is only capable of detecting 47.64%. In addition to its remarkable performance, TraWiC has low resource overhead in contrast to pair-wise clone detection that is conducted during the auditing process of tools like CodeWhisperer reference tracker, across thousands of code snippets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Graham Pash, Malik Hassanaly, Shashank Yellapantula</p>
<p>Abstract: While many physics-based closure model forms have been posited for the sub-filter scale (SFS) in large eddy simulation (LES), vast amounts of data available from direct numerical simulation (DNS) create opportunities to leverage data-driven modeling techniques. Albeit flexible, data-driven models still depend on the dataset and the functional form of the model chosen. Increased adoption of such models requires reliable uncertainty estimates both in the data-informed and out-of-distribution regimes. In this work, we employ Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in a reacting flow model. In particular, we model the filtered progress variable scalar dissipation rate which plays a key role in the dynamics of turbulent premixed flames. We demonstrate that BNN models can provide unique insights about the structure of uncertainty of the data-driven closure models. We also propose a method for the incorporation of out-of-distribution information in a BNN. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated by a priori evaluation on a dataset consisting of a variety of flame conditions and fuels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ali Hassani, Wen-Mei Hwu, Humphrey Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neighborhood attention reduces the cost of self attention by restricting each token's attention span to its nearest neighbors. This restriction, parameterized by a window size and dilation factor, draws a spectrum of possible attention patterns between linear projection and self attention. Neighborhood attention, and more generally sliding window attention patterns, have long been bounded by infrastructure, particularly in higher-rank spaces (2-D and 3-D), calling for the development of custom kernels, which have been limited in either functionality, or performance, if not both. In this work, we aim to massively improve upon existing infrastructure by providing two new methods for implementing neighborhood attention. We first show that neighborhood attention can be represented as a batched GEMM problem, similar to standard attention, and implement it for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention. These kernels on average provide 895% and 272% improvement in full precision runtime compared to existing naive CUDA kernels for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention respectively. We find that aside from being heavily bound by memory bandwidth, certain inherent inefficiencies exist in all unfused implementations of neighborhood attention, which in most cases undo their theoretical efficiency gain. Motivated by the progress made into fused dot-product attention kernels, we developed fused neighborhood attention; an adaptation of fused dot-product attention kernels that allow fine-grained control over attention across different spatial axes. Known for reducing the quadratic time complexity of self attention to a linear complexity, neighborhood attention can now enjoy a reduced and constant memory footprint, and record-breaking half precision runtime. We observe that our fused implementation successfully circumvents some of the unavoidable inefficiencies in unfused implementations...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jio Oh, Soyeon Kim, Junseok Seo, Jindong Wang, Ruochen Xu, Xing Xie, Steven Euijong Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performances in various applications, yet evaluating them is still challenging. Existing benchmarks are either manually constructed or are automatic, but lack the ability to evaluate the thought process of LLMs with arbitrary complexity. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks as they contain structured knowledge that can be used to question LLMs. Unlike knowledge graphs, which are also used to evaluate LLMs, relational databases have integrity constraints that can be used to better construct complex in-depth questions and verify answers: (1) functional dependencies can be used to pinpoint critical keywords that an LLM must know to properly answer a given question containing certain attribute values; and (2) foreign key constraints can be used to join relations and construct multi-hop questions, which can be arbitrarily long and used to debug intermediate answers. We thus propose ERBench, which uses these integrity constraints to convert any database into an LLM benchmark. ERBench supports continuous evaluation as databases change, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct LLM benchmarks using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We show how ERBench can properly evaluate any LLM by not only checking for answer correctness, but also effectively verifying the rationales by looking for the right keywords.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivaram Gopal, S M Ferdous, Hemanta K. Maji, Alex Pothen</p>
<p>Abstract: We describe a parallel approximation algorithm for maximizing monotone submodular functions subject to hereditary constraints on distributed memory multiprocessors. Our work is motivated by the need to solve submodular optimization problems on massive data sets, for practical applications in areas such as data summarization, machine learning, and graph sparsification. Our work builds on the randomized distributed RandGreedI algorithm, proposed by Barbosa, Ene, Nguyen, and Ward (2015). This algorithm computes a distributed solution by randomly partitioning the data among all the processors and then employing a single accumulation step in which all processors send their partial solutions to one processor. However, for large problems, the accumulation step could exceed the memory available on a processor, and the processor which performs the accumulation could become a computational bottleneck.
  Here, we propose a generalization of the RandGreedI algorithm that employs multiple accumulation steps to reduce the memory required. We analyze the approximation ratio and the time complexity of the algorithm (in the BSP model). We also evaluate the new GreedyML algorithm on three classes of problems, and report results from massive data sets with millions of elements. The results show that the GreedyML algorithm can solve problems where the sequential Greedy and distributed RandGreedI algorithms fail due to memory constraints. For certain computationally intensive problems, the GreedyML algorithm can be faster than the RandGreedI algorithm. The observed approximation quality of the solutions computed by the GreedyML algorithm closely matches those obtained by the RandGreedI algorithm on these problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Malek Mechergui, Sarath Sreedharan</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting and handling misspecified objectives, such as reward functions, has been widely recognized as one of the central challenges within the domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) safety research. However, even with the recognition of the importance of this problem, we are unaware of any works that attempt to provide a clear definition for what constitutes (a) misspecified objectives and (b) successfully resolving such misspecifications. In this work, we use the theory of mind, i.e., the human user's beliefs about the AI agent, as a basis to develop a formal explanatory framework called Expectation Alignment (EAL) to understand the objective misspecification and its causes. Our EAL framework not only acts as an explanatory framework for existing works but also provides us with concrete insights into the limitations of existing methods to handle reward misspecification and novel solution strategies. We use these insights to propose a new interactive algorithm that uses the specified reward to infer potential user expectations about the system behavior. We show how one can efficiently implement this algorithm by mapping the inference problem into linear programs. We evaluate our method on a set of standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyong Bae, Hawoong Jeong</p>
<p>Abstract: Bridging the gap between the practical performance of deep learning and its theoretical foundations often involves analyzing neural networks through stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Expanding on previous research that focused on modeling structured inputs under a simple Gaussian setting, we analyze the behavior of a deep learning system trained on inputs modeled as Gaussian mixtures to better simulate more general structured inputs. Through empirical analysis and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that under certain standardization schemes, the deep learning model converges toward Gaussian setting behavior, even when the input data follow more complex or real-world distributions. This finding exhibits a form of universality in which diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, which can support the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pierre Baldi, Antonios Alexos, Ian Domingo, Alireza Rahmansetayesh</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop a general theory of synaptic neural balance and how it can emerge or be enforced in neural networks. For a given regularizer, a neuron is said to be in balance if the total cost of its input weights is equal to the total cost of its output weights. The basic example is provided by feedforward networks of ReLU units trained with $L_2$ regularizers, which exhibit balance after proper training. The theory explains this phenomenon and extends it in several directions. The first direction is the extension to bilinear and other activation functions. The second direction is the extension to more general regularizers, including all $L_p$ regularizers. The third direction is the extension to non-layered architectures, recurrent architectures, convolutional architectures, as well as architectures with mixed activation functions. Gradient descent on the error function alone does not converge in general to a balanced state, where every neuron is in balance, even when starting from a balanced state. However, gradient descent on the regularized error function ought to converge to a balanced state, and thus network balance can be used to assess learning progress. The theory is based on two local neuronal operations: scaling which is commutative, and balancing which is not commutative. Given any initial set of weights, when local balancing operations are applied to each neuron in a stochastic manner, global order always emerges through the convergence of the stochastic balancing algorithm to the same unique set of balanced weights. The reason for this is the existence of an underlying strictly convex optimization problem where the relevant variables are constrained to a linear, only architecture-dependent, manifold. Simulations show that balancing neurons prior to learning, or during learning in alternation with gradient descent steps, can improve learning speed and final performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nam Phuong Tran, The Anh Ta, Debmalya Mandal, Long Tran-Thanh</p>
<p>Abstract: High-dimensional linear bandits with low-dimensional structure have received considerable attention in recent studies due to their practical significance. The most common structure in the literature is sparsity. However, it may not be available in practice. Symmetry, where the reward is invariant under certain groups of transformations on the set of arms, is another important inductive bias in the high-dimensional case that covers many standard structures, including sparsity. In this work, we study high-dimensional symmetric linear bandits where the symmetry is hidden from the learner, and the correct symmetry needs to be learned in an online setting. We examine the structure of a collection of hidden symmetry and provide a method based on model selection within the collection of low-dimensional subspaces. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $ O(d_0^{2/3} T^{2/3} \log(d))$, where $d$ is the ambient dimension which is potentially very large, and $d_0$ is the dimension of the true low-dimensional subspace such that $d_0 \ll d$. With an extra assumption on well-separated models, we can further improve the regret to $ O(d_0\sqrt{T\log(d)} )$.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Otmane Sakhi, Imad Aouali, Pierre Alquier, Nicolas Chopin</p>
<p>Abstract: This work investigates the offline formulation of the contextual bandit problem, where the goal is to leverage past interactions collected under a behavior policy to evaluate, select, and learn new, potentially better-performing, policies. Motivated by critical applications, we move beyond point estimators. Instead, we adopt the principle of pessimism where we construct upper bounds that assess a policy's worst-case performance, enabling us to confidently select and learn improved policies. Precisely, we introduce novel, fully empirical concentration bounds for a broad class of importance weighting risk estimators. These bounds are general enough to cover most existing estimators and pave the way for the development of new ones. In particular, our pursuit of the tightest bound within this class motivates a novel estimator (LS), that logarithmically smooths large importance weights. The bound for LS is provably tighter than its competitors, and naturally results in improved policy selection and learning strategies. Extensive policy evaluation, selection, and learning experiments highlight the versatility and favorable performance of LS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Domenic Rosati, Jan Wehner, Kai Williams, {\L}ukasz Bartoszcze, David Atanasov, Robie Gonzales, Subhabrata Majumdar, Carsten Maple, Hassan Sajjad, Frank Rudzicz</p>
<p>Abstract: Releasing open-source large language models (LLMs) presents a dual-use risk since bad actors can easily fine-tune these models for harmful purposes. Even without the open release of weights, weight stealing and fine-tuning APIs make closed models vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks (HFAs). While safety measures like preventing jailbreaks and improving safety guardrails are important, such measures can easily be reversed through fine-tuning. In this work, we propose Representation Noising (RepNoise), a defence mechanism that operates even when attackers have access to the weights. RepNoise works by removing information about harmful representations such that it is difficult to recover them during fine-tuning. Importantly, our defence is also able to generalize across different subsets of harm that have not been seen during the defence process as long as they are drawn from the same distribution of the attack set. Our method does not degrade the general capability of LLMs and retains the ability to train the model on harmless tasks. We provide empirical evidence that the efficacy of our defence lies in its ``depth'': the degree to which information about harmful representations is removed across all layers of the LLM. We also find areas where RepNoise still remains ineffective and highlight how those limitations can inform future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Implicit Personalization (IP) is a phenomenon of language models inferring a user's background from the implicit cues in the input prompts and tailoring the response based on this inference. While previous work has touched upon various instances of this problem, there lacks a unified framework to study this behavior. This work systematically studies IP through a rigorous mathematical formulation, a multi-perspective moral reasoning framework, and a set of case studies. Our theoretical foundation for IP relies on a structural causal model and introduces a novel method, indirect intervention, to estimate the causal effect of a mediator variable that cannot be directly intervened upon. Beyond the technical approach, we also introduce a set of moral reasoning principles based on three schools of moral philosophy to study when IP may or may not be ethically appropriate. Equipped with both mathematical and ethical insights, we present three diverse case studies illustrating the varied nature of the IP problem and offer recommendations for future research.

<p>Abstract: Understanding connections between artificial and biological intelligent systems can reveal fundamental principles of general intelligence. While many artificial intelligence models have a neuroscience counterpart, such connections are largely missing in Transformer models and the self-attention mechanism. Here, we examine the relationship between interacting attention heads and human episodic memory. We focus on induction heads, which contribute to in-context learning in Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that induction heads are behaviorally, functionally, and mechanistically similar to the contextual maintenance and retrieval (CMR) model of human episodic memory. Our analyses of LLMs pre-trained on extensive text data show that CMR-like heads often emerge in the intermediate and late layers, qualitatively mirroring human memory biases. The ablation of CMR-like heads suggests their causal role in in-context learning. Our findings uncover a parallel between the computational mechanisms of LLMs and human memory, offering valuable insights into both research fields.</p>

<p>Abstract: World models empower model-based agents to interactively explore, reason, and plan within imagined environments for real-world decision-making. However, the high demand for interactivity poses challenges in harnessing recent advancements in video generative models for developing world models at scale. This work introduces Interactive VideoGPT (iVideoGPT), a scalable autoregressive transformer framework that integrates multimodal signals--visual observations, actions, and rewards--into a sequence of tokens, facilitating an interactive experience of agents via next-token prediction. iVideoGPT features a novel compressive tokenization technique that efficiently discretizes high-dimensional visual observations. Leveraging its scalable architecture, we are able to pre-train iVideoGPT on millions of human and robotic manipulation trajectories, establishing a versatile foundation that is adaptable to serve as interactive world models for a wide range of downstream tasks. These include action-conditioned video prediction, visual planning, and model-based reinforcement learning, where iVideoGPT achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our work advances the development of interactive general world models, bridging the gap between generative video models and practical model-based reinforcement learning applications.

<p>Abstract: Most popular benchmarks for comparing LLMs rely on a limited set of prompt templates, which may not fully capture the LLMs' abilities and can affect the reproducibility of results on leaderboards. Many recent works empirically verify prompt sensitivity and advocate for changes in LLM evaluation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the performance distribution across many prompt variants instead of finding a single prompt to evaluate with. We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a large set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce accurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets. The resulting distribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various robust performance metrics (e.g., top 95% quantile or median). We prove that PromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench Hard, and LMentry; for example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance quantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two single-prompt evaluations. Moreover, we show how PromptEval can be useful in LLM-as-a-judge and best prompt identification applications.</p>

We formalize this question as the problem of learning social welfare functions belonging to the well-studied family of power mean functions. We focus on two learning tasks; in the first, the input is vectors of utilities of an action (decision or policy) for individuals in a group and their associated social welfare as judged by a policy maker, whereas in the second, the input is pairwise comparisons between the welfares associated with a given pair of utility vectors. We show that power mean functions are learnable with polynomial sample complexity in both cases, even if the comparisons are social welfare information is noisy. Finally, we design practical algorithms for these tasks and evaluate their performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach to sequential Bayesian inference based on variational Bayes (VB). The key insight is that, in the online setting, we do not need to add the KL term to regularize to the prior (which comes from the posterior at the previous timestep); instead we can optimize just the expected log-likelihood, performing a single step of natural gradient descent starting at the prior predictive. We prove this method recovers exact Bayesian inference if the model is conjugate. We also show how to compute an efficient deterministic approximation to the VB objective, as well as our simplified objective, when the variational distribution is Gaussian or a sub-family, including the case of a diagonal plus low-rank precision matrix. We show empirically that our method outperforms other online VB methods in the non-conjugate setting, such as online learning for neural networks, especially when controlling for computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Miao, Qiongshi Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research. In conjunction with classical statistical approaches, ML-assisted analytical strategies have shown great promise in accelerating research findings. This has also opened a whole field of methodological research focusing on integrative approaches that leverage both ML and statistics to tackle data science challenges. One type of study that has quickly gained popularity employs ML to predict unobserved outcomes in massive samples, and then uses predicted outcomes in downstream statistical inference. However, existing methods designed to ensure the validity of this type of post-prediction inference are limited to very basic tasks such as linear regression analysis. This is because any extension of these approaches to new, more sophisticated statistical tasks requires task-specific algebraic derivations and software implementations, which ignores the massive library of existing software tools already developed for the same scientific problem given observed data. This severely constrains the scope of application for post-prediction inference. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel statistical framework named PSPS for task-agnostic ML-assisted inference. It provides a post-prediction inference solution that can be easily plugged into almost any established data analysis routines. It delivers valid and efficient inference that is robust to arbitrary choice of ML model, allowing nearly all existing statistical frameworks to be incorporated into the analysis of ML-predicted data.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wooseong Cho, Taehyun Hwang, Joongkyu Lee, Min-hwan Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: We study reinforcement learning with multinomial logistic (MNL) function approximation where the underlying transition probability kernel of the Markov decision processes (MDPs) is parametrized by an unknown transition core with features of state and action. For the finite horizon episodic setting with inhomogeneous state transitions, we propose provably efficient algorithms with randomized exploration having frequentist regret guarantees. For our first algorithm, $\texttt{RRL-MNL}$, we adapt optimistic sampling to ensure the optimism of the estimated value function with sufficient frequency. We establish that $\texttt{RRL-MNL}$ achieves a $\tilde{O}(\kappa^{-1} d^{\frac{3}{2}} H^{\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{T})$ frequentist regret bound with constant-time computational cost per episode. Here, $d$ is the dimension of the transition core, $H$ is the horizon length, $T$ is the total number of steps, and $\kappa$ is a problem-dependent constant. Despite the simplicity and practicality of $\texttt{RRL-MNL}$, its regret bound scales with $\kappa^{-1}$, which is potentially large in the worst case. To improve the dependence on $\kappa^{-1}$, we propose $\texttt{ORRL-MNL}$, which estimates the value function using the local gradient information of the MNL transition model. We show that its frequentist regret bound is $\tilde{O}(d^{\frac{3}{2}} H^{\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{T} + \kappa^{-1} d^2 H^2)$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first randomized RL algorithms for the MNL transition model that achieve statistical guarantees with constant-time computational cost per episode. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Federico Mora, Justin Wong, Haley Lepe, Sahil Bhatia, Karim Elmaaroufi, George Varghese, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Elizabeth Polgreen, Sanjit A. Seshia</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for code applications have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot fluency and instruction following on challenging code related tasks ranging from test case generation to self-repair. Unsurprisingly, however, models struggle to compose syntactically valid programs in programming languages unrepresented in pre-training, referred to as very low-resource Programming Languages (VLPLs). VLPLs appear in crucial settings, including domain-specific languages for internal tools, tool-chains for legacy languages, and formal verification frameworks. Inspired by a technique called natural programming elicitation, we propose designing an intermediate language that LLMs "naturally" know how to use and which can be automatically compiled to a target VLPL. When LLMs generate code that lies outside of this intermediate language, we use compiler techniques to repair the code into programs in the intermediate language. Overall, we introduce \emph{synthetic programming elicitation and compilation} (SPEAC), an approach that enables LLMs to generate syntactically valid code even for VLPLs. We empirically evaluate the performance of SPEAC in a case study for the UCLID5 formal verification language and find that, compared to existing retrieval and fine-tuning baselines, SPEAC produces syntactically correct programs more frequently and without sacrificing semantic correctness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Parnian Kassraie, Aram-Alexandre Pooladian, Michal Klein, James Thornton, Jonathan Niles-Weed, Marco Cuturi</p>
<p>Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has profoundly impacted machine learning by providing theoretical and computational tools to realign datasets. In this context, given two large point clouds of sizes $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, entropic OT (EOT) solvers have emerged as the most reliable tool to either solve the Kantorovich problem and output a $n\times m$ coupling matrix, or to solve the Monge problem and learn a vector-valued push-forward map. While the robustness of EOT couplings/maps makes them a go-to choice in practical applications, EOT solvers remain difficult to tune because of a small but influential set of hyperparameters, notably the omnipresent entropic regularization strength $\varepsilon$. Setting $\varepsilon$ can be difficult, as it simultaneously impacts various performance metrics, such as compute speed, statistical performance, generalization, and bias. In this work, we propose a new class of EOT solvers (ProgOT), that can estimate both plans and transport maps. We take advantage of several opportunities to optimize the computation of EOT solutions by dividing mass displacement using a time discretization, borrowing inspiration from dynamic OT formulations, and conquering each of these steps using EOT with properly scheduled parameters. We provide experimental evidence demonstrating that ProgOT is a faster and more robust alternative to standard solvers when computing couplings at large scales, even outperforming neural network-based approaches. We also prove statistical consistency of our approach for estimating optimal transport maps.</p>

This method exploits artificial neural networks to identify noisy transition lines in stability diagrams, guiding a robust exploration strategy leveraging neural networks' uncertainty estimations. Tested across three distinct offline experimental datasets representing different single quantum dot technologies, the approach achieves over 99% tuning success rate in optimal cases, where more than 10% of the success is directly attributable to uncertainty exploitation. The challenging constraints of small training sets containing high diagram-to-diagram variability allowed us to evaluate the capabilities and limits of the proposed procedure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Yuhao Liu, Yaxuan Wang, Jeffrey Flanigan, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to encompass extensive knowledge across diverse domains. Yet controlling what a large language model should not know is important for ensuring alignment and thus safe use. However, accurately and efficiently unlearning knowledge from an LLM remains challenging due to the potential collateral damage caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting, and the large computational requirements for optimization across state-of-the-art models with hundreds of billions of parameters. In this work, we present \textbf{Embedding-COrrupted (ECO) Prompts}, a lightweight unlearning framework for large language models to address both the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning efficiency. Instead of relying on the LLM itself to unlearn, we enforce an unlearned state during inference by employing a prompt classifier to identify and safeguard prompts to forget. We learn corruptions added to prompt embeddings via zeroth order optimization toward the unlearning objective offline and corrupt prompts flagged by the classifier during inference. We find that these embedding-corrupted prompts not only lead to desirable outputs that satisfy the unlearning objective but also closely approximate the output from a model that has never been trained on the data intended for forgetting. Through extensive experiments on unlearning, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving promising unlearning at \textit{nearly zero side effects} in general domains and domains closely related to the unlearned ones. Additionally, we highlight the scalability of our method to 100 LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 236B parameters, incurring no additional cost as the number of parameters increases.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Zhang, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Wei Gao, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The recent development of chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding has enabled large language models (LLMs) to generate explicit logical reasoning paths for complex problem-solving. However, research indicates that these paths are not always deliberate and optimal. The tree-of-thought (ToT) method employs tree-searching to extensively explore the reasoning space and find better reasoning paths that CoT decoding might overlook. This deliberation, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased inference complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs leveraging the search tree constructed by ToT allows CoT to achieve similar or better performance, thereby avoiding the substantial inference burden. This is achieved through Chain of Preference Optimization (CPO), where LLMs are fine-tuned to align each step of the CoT reasoning paths with those of ToT using the inherent preference information in the tree-search process. Extensive experimental results show that CPO significantly improves LLM performance in solving a variety of complex problems, including question answering, fact verification, and arithmetic reasoning, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soufiane Belharbi, Mara KM Whitford, Phuong Hoang, Shakeeb Murtaza, Luke McCaffrey, Eric Granger</p>
<p>Abstract: Confocal fluorescence microscopy is one of the most accessible and widely used imaging techniques for the study of biological processes at the cellular and subcellular levels. Scanning confocal microscopy allows the capture of high-quality images from thick three-dimensional (3D) samples, yet suffers from well-known limitations such as photobleaching and phototoxicity of specimens caused by intense light exposure, limiting its applications. Cellular damage can be alleviated by changing imaging parameters to reduce light exposure, often at the expense of image quality. Machine/deep learning methods for single-image super-resolution (SISR) can be applied to restore image quality by upscaling lower-resolution (LR) images to yield high-resolution images (HR). These SISR methods have been successfully applied to photo-realistic images due partly to the abundance of publicly available data. In contrast, the lack of publicly available data partly limits their application and success in scanning confocal microscopy. In this paper, we introduce a large scanning confocal microscopy dataset named SR-CACO-2 that is comprised of low- and high-resolution image pairs marked for three different fluorescent markers. It allows the evaluation of performance of SISR methods on three different upscaling levels (X2, X4, X8). SR-CACO-2 contains the human epithelial cell line Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37), and it is composed of 2,200 unique images, captured with four resolutions and three markers, forming 9,937 image patches for SISR methods. We provide benchmarking results for 16 state-of-the-art methods of the main SISR families. Results show that these methods have limited success in producing high-resolution textures. The dataset is freely accessible under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

<p><b>Authors:</b> John J. Cherian, Isaac Gibbs, Emmanuel J. Cand\`es</p>
<p>Abstract: We develop new conformal inference methods for obtaining validity guarantees on the output of large language models (LLMs). Prior work in conformal language modeling identifies a subset of the text that satisfies a high-probability guarantee of correctness. These methods work by filtering claims from the LLM's original response if a scoring function evaluated on the claim fails to exceed a threshold calibrated via split conformal prediction. Existing methods in this area suffer from two deficiencies. First, the guarantee stated is not conditionally valid. The trustworthiness of the filtering step may vary based on the topic of the response. Second, because the scoring function is imperfect, the filtering step can remove many valuable and accurate claims. We address both of these challenges via two new conformal methods. First, we generalize the conditional conformal procedure of Gibbs et al. (2023) in order to adaptively issue weaker guarantees when they are required to preserve the utility of the output. Second, we show how to systematically improve the quality of the scoring function via a novel algorithm for differentiating through the conditional conformal procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on biography and medical question-answering datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyu Xu, Nikos Karampatziakis, Paul Mineiro</p>
<p>Abstract: Rigorously establishing the safety of black-box machine learning models concerning critical risk measures is important for providing guarantees about model behavior. Recently, Bates et. al. (JACM '24) introduced the notion of a risk controlling prediction set (RCPS) for producing prediction sets that are statistically guaranteed low risk from machine learning models. Our method extends this notion to the sequential setting, where we provide guarantees even when the data is collected adaptively, and ensures that the risk guarantee is anytime-valid, i.e., simultaneously holds at all time steps. Further, we propose a framework for constructing RCPSes for active labeling, i.e., allowing one to use a labeling policy that chooses whether to query the true label for each received data point and ensures that the expected proportion of data points whose labels are queried are below a predetermined label budget. We also describe how to use predictors (i.e., the machine learning model for which we provide risk control guarantees) to further improve the utility of our RCPSes by estimating the expected risk conditioned on the covariates. We characterize the optimal choices of label policy and predictor under a fixed label budget and show a regret result that relates the estimation error of the optimal labeling policy and predictor to the wealth process that underlies our RCPSes. Lastly, we present practical ways of formulating label policies and empirically show that our label policies use fewer labels to reach higher utility than naive baseline labeling strategies on both simulations and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabe Guo, Tristan Saidi, Maxwell Terban, Michele Valsecchi, Simon JL Billinge, Hod Lipson</p>
<p>Abstract: A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure of nanometer sized objects. Here we present a novel approach that uses a generative machine learning model based on diffusion processes that is trained on 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction pattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the information-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small as 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity, including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can successfully and verifiably determine structural candidates four out of five times, with average error among these candidates being only 7% (as measured by post-Rietveld refinement R-factor). Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments. We suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of previously unsolved nano-materials.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multimodal interleaved datasets featuring free-form interleaved sequences of images and text are crucial for training frontier large multimodal models (LMMs). Despite the rapid progression of open-source LMMs, there remains a pronounced scarcity of large-scale, diverse open-source multimodal interleaved datasets. In response, we introduce MINT-1T, the most extensive and diverse open-source Multimodal INTerleaved dataset to date. MINT-1T comprises one trillion text tokens and 3.4 billion images, a 10x scale-up from existing open-source datasets. Additionally, we include previously untapped sources such as PDFs and ArXiv papers. As scaling multimodal interleaved datasets requires substantial engineering effort, sharing the data curation process and releasing the dataset greatly benefits the community. Our experiments show that LMMs trained on MINT-1T rival the performance of models trained on the previous leading dataset, OBELICS.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Sarch, Lawrence Jang, Michael J. Tarr, William W. Cohen, Kenneth Marino, Katerina Fragkiadaki</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative language and vision-language models excel in in-context learning for decision making. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These abstractions are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory. The resulting examples, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7% using GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such abstractions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand, open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pietro Mazzaglia, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt, Aaron Courville, Sai Rajeswar</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning generalist embodied agents, able to solve multitudes of tasks in different domains is a long-standing problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free policy learning strategy, our approach lays the groundwork for foundational policy learning using generative world models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dustin Wright, Arnav Arora, Nadav Borenstein, Srishti Yadav, Serge Belongie, Isabelle Augenstein</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncovering latent values and opinions embedded in large language models (LLMs) can help identify biases and mitigate potential harm. Recently, this has been approached by prompting LLMs with survey questions and quantifying the stances in the outputs towards morally and politically charged statements. However, the stances generated by LLMs can vary greatly depending on how they are prompted, and there are many ways to argue for or against a given position. In this work, we propose to address this by analysing a large and robust dataset of 156k LLM responses to the 62 propositions of the Political Compass Test (PCT) generated by 6 LLMs using 420 prompt variations. We perform coarse-grained analysis of their generated stances and fine-grained analysis of the plain text justifications for those stances. For fine-grained analysis, we propose to identify tropes in the responses: semantically similar phrases that are recurrent and consistent across different prompts, revealing natural patterns in the text that a given LLM is prone to produce. We find that demographic features added to prompts significantly affect outcomes on the PCT, reflecting bias, as well as disparities between the results of tests when eliciting closed-form vs. open domain responses. Additionally, patterns in the plain text rationales via tropes show that similar justifications are repeatedly generated across models and prompts even with disparate stances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peter M{\o}rch Groth, Mads Herbert Kerrn, Lars Olsen, Jesper Salomon, Wouter Boomsma</p>
<p>Abstract: Reliable prediction of protein variant effects is crucial for both protein optimization and for advancing biological understanding. For practical use in protein engineering, it is important that we can also provide reliable uncertainty estimates for our predictions, and while prediction accuracy has seen much progress in recent years, uncertainty metrics are rarely reported. We here provide a Gaussian process regression model, Kermut, with a novel composite kernel for modeling mutation similarity, which obtains state-of-the-art performance for supervised protein variant effect prediction while also offering estimates of uncertainty through its posterior. An analysis of the quality of the uncertainty estimates demonstrates that our model provides meaningful levels of overall calibration, but that instance-specific uncertainty calibration remains more challenging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weimin Wu, Zhao Song, Han Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate the statistical and computational limits of latent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) under the low-dimensional linear latent space assumption. Statistically, we study the universal approximation and sample complexity of the DiTs score function, as well as the distribution recovery property of the initial data. Specifically, under mild data assumptions, we derive an approximation error bound for the score network of latent DiTs, which is sub-linear in the latent space dimension. Additionally, we derive the corresponding sample complexity bound and show that the data distribution generated from the estimated score function converges toward a proximate area of the original one. Computationally, we characterize the hardness of both forward inference and backward computation of latent DiTs, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For forward inference, we identify efficient criteria for all possible latent DiTs inference algorithms and showcase our theory by pushing the efficiency toward almost-linear time inference. For backward computation, we leverage the low-rank structure within the gradient computation of DiTs training for possible algorithmic speedup. Specifically, we show that such speedup achieves almost-linear time latent DiTs training by casting the DiTs gradient as a series of chained low-rank approximations with bounded error. Under the low-dimensional assumption, we show that the statistical rates and the computational efficiency are all dominated by the dimension of the subspace, suggesting that latent DiTs have the potential to bypass the challenges associated with the high dimensionality of initial data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikhil Abhyankar, Vivek Gupta, Dan Roth, Chandan K. Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves interpreting natural language queries about tabular data, which presents a unique challenge of combining language understanding with structured data analysis. Existing methods employ either textual reasoning, which excels in semantic interpretation but struggles with mathematical operations, or symbolic reasoning, which handles computations well but lacks semantic understanding. This paper introduces a novel algorithm H-STAR that integrates both symbolic and semantic (textual) approaches in a two-stage process to address these limitations. H-STAR employs: (1) step-wise table extraction using `multi-view' column retrieval followed by row extraction, and (2) adaptive reasoning that adapts reasoning strategies based on question types, utilizing semantic reasoning for direct lookup and complex lexical queries while augmenting textual reasoning with symbolic reasoning support for quantitative and logical tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that H-STAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three tabular question-answering (QA) and fact-verification datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilker Oguz, Niyazi Ulas Dinc, Mustafa Yildirim, Junjie Ke, Innfarn Yoo, Qifei Wang, Feng Yang, Christophe Moser, Demetri Psaltis</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models generate new samples by progressively decreasing the noise from the initially provided random distribution. This inference procedure generally utilizes a trained neural network numerous times to obtain the final output, creating significant latency and energy consumption on digital electronic hardware such as GPUs. In this study, we demonstrate that the propagation of a light beam through a semi-transparent medium can be programmed to implement a denoising diffusion model on image samples. This framework projects noisy image patterns through passive diffractive optical layers, which collectively only transmit the predicted noise term in the image. The optical transparent layers, which are trained with an online training approach, backpropagating the error to the analytical model of the system, are passive and kept the same across different steps of denoising. Hence this method enables high-speed image generation with minimal power consumption, benefiting from the bandwidth and energy efficiency of optical information processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanting Miao, William Loh, Suraj Kothawade, Pascal Poupart, Abdullah Rashwan, Yeqing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have recently attracted considerable interest, enabling the synthesis of high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models often lack the capability to generate specific subjects from given reference images or to synthesize novel renditions under varying conditions. Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI) have made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily focus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups, often overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to the reference images. In this work, we present the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping for faster training and effective regularization. By combining the Bradley-Terry preference model, the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function also provides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks. We propose Reward Preference Optimization (RPO), which offers a simpler setup (requiring only $3\%$ of the negative samples used by DreamBooth) and fewer gradient steps for fine-tuning. Unlike most existing methods, our approach does not require training a text encoder or optimizing text embeddings and achieves text-image alignment by fine-tuning only the U-Net component. Empirically, $\lambda$-Harmonic proves to be a reliable approach for model selection in subject-driven generation tasks. Based on preference labels and early stopping validation from the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, our algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art CLIP-I score of 0.833 and a CLIP-T score of 0.314 on DreamBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junghyun Lee, Se-Young Yun, Kwang-Sung Jun</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a unified likelihood ratio-based confidence sequence (CS) for any (self-concordant) generalized linear model (GLM) that is guaranteed to be convex and numerically tight. We show that this is on par or improves upon known CSs for various GLMs, including Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Poisson. In particular, for the first time, our CS for Bernoulli has a $\mathrm{poly}(S)$-free radius where $S$ is the norm of the unknown parameter. Our first technical novelty is its derivation, which utilizes a time-uniform PAC-Bayesian bound with a uniform prior/posterior, despite the latter being a rather unpopular choice for deriving CSs. As a direct application of our new CS, we propose a simple and natural optimistic algorithm called OFUGLB, applicable to any generalized linear bandits (GLB; Filippi et al. (2010)). Our analysis shows that the celebrated optimistic approach simultaneously attains state-of-the-art regrets for various self-concordant (not necessarily bounded) GLBs, and even $\mathrm{poly}(S)$-free for bounded GLBs, including logistic bandits. The regret analysis, our second technical novelty, follows from combining our new CS with a new proof technique that completely avoids the previously widely used self-concordant control lemma (Faury et al., 2020, Lemma 9). Numerically, OFUGLB outperforms or is at par with prior algorithms for logistic bandits.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Martin Bauer, Facundo M\'emoli, Tom Needham, Mao Nishino</p>
<p>Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing metric measure spaces which has found broad applications in data science and machine learning. Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. This paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural-based multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully applied to many recommendation applications. However, these MTL models (e.g., MMoE, PLE) did not consider feature interaction during the optimization, which is crucial for capturing complex high-order features and has been widely used in ranking models for real-world recommender systems. Moreover, through feature importance analysis across various tasks in MTL, we have observed an interesting divergence phenomenon that the same feature can have significantly different importance across different tasks in MTL. To address these issues, we propose Deep Multiple Task-specific Feature Interactions Network (DTN) with a novel model structure design. DTN introduces multiple diversified task-specific feature interaction methods and task-sensitive network in MTL networks, enabling the model to learn task-specific diversified feature interaction representations, which improves the efficiency of joint representation learning in a general setup. We applied DTN to our company's real-world E-commerce recommendation dataset, which consisted of over 6.3 billion samples, the results demonstrated that DTN significantly outperformed state-of-the-art MTL models. Moreover, during online evaluation of DTN in a large-scale E-commerce recommender system, we observed a 3.28% in clicks, a 3.10% increase in orders and a 2.70% increase in GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to the state-of-the-art MTL models. Finally, extensive offline experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTN can be applied to various scenarios beyond recommendations, enhancing the performance of ranking models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep supervised learning models require high volume of labeled data to attain sufficiently good results. Although, the practice of gathering and annotating such big data is costly and laborious. Recently, the application of self supervised learning (SSL) in vision tasks has gained significant attention. The intuition behind SSL is to exploit the synchronous relationships within the data as a form of self-supervision, which can be versatile. In the current big data era, most of the data is unlabeled, and the success of SSL thus relies in finding ways to utilize this vast amount of unlabeled data available. Thus it is better for deep learning algorithms to reduce reliance on human supervision and instead focus on self-supervision based on the inherent relationships within the data. With the advent of ViTs, which have achieved remarkable results in computer vision, it is crucial to explore and understand the various SSL mechanisms employed for training these models specifically in scenarios where there is limited labelled data available. In this survey, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of systematically classifying the SSL techniques based upon their representations and pre-training tasks being applied. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review popular pre-training tasks, and highlight the challenges and advancements in this field. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of different SSL methods, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and identify potential avenues for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zichen Jeff Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuomotor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best viewed at https://dynamo-ssl.github.io</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ming Xiang, Stratis Ioannidis, Edmund Yeh, Carlee Joe-Wong, Lili Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Addressing intermittent client availability is critical for the real-world deployment of federated learning algorithms. Most prior work either overlooks the potential non-stationarity in the dynamics of client unavailability or requires substantial memory/computation overhead. We study federated learning in the presence of heterogeneous and non-stationary client availability, which may occur when the deployment environments are uncertain, or the clients are mobile. The impacts of heterogeneity and non-stationarity on client unavailability can be significant, as we illustrate using FedAvg, the most widely adopted federated learning algorithm. We propose FedAPM, which includes novel algorithmic structures that (i) compensate for missed computations due to unavailability with only $O(1)$ additional memory and computation with respect to standard FedAvg, and (ii) evenly diffuse local updates within the federated learning system through implicit gossiping, despite being agnostic to non-stationary dynamics. We show that FedAPM converges to a stationary point of even non-convex objectives while achieving the desired linear speedup property. We corroborate our analysis with numerical experiments over diversified client unavailability dynamics on real-world data sets.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MIO, a novel foundation model built on multimodal tokens, capable of understanding and generating speech, text, images, and videos in an end-to-end, autoregressive manner. While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivang Rawat, David J. Heeger, Stefano Martiniani</p>
<p>Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emanuele Natale (COATI), Davide Ferre' (COATI), Giordano Giambartolomei (COATI), Fr\'ed\'eric Giroire (COATI), Frederik Mallmann-Trenn</p>
<p>Abstract: Considerable research efforts have recently been made to show that a random neural network $N$ contains subnetworks capable of accurately approximating any given neural network that is sufficiently smaller than $N$, without any training. This line of research, known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), was originally motivated by the weaker Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which states that a sufficiently large random neural network $N$ contains \emph{sparse} subnetworks that can be trained efficiently to achieve performance comparable to that of training the entire network $N$. Despite its original motivation, results on the SLTH have so far not provided any guarantee on the size of subnetworks. Such limitation is due to the nature of the main technical tool leveraged by these results, the Random Subset Sum (RSS) Problem. Informally, the RSS Problem asks how large a random i.i.d. sample $\Omega$ should be so that we are able to approximate any number in $[-1,1]$, up to an error of $ \epsilon$, as the sum of a suitable subset of $\Omega$. We provide the first proof of the SLTH in classical settings, such as dense and equivariant networks, with guarantees on the sparsity of the subnetworks. Central to our results, is the proof of an essentially tight bound on the Random Fixed-Size Subset Sum Problem (RFSS), a variant of the RSS Problem in which we only ask for subsets of a given size, which is of independent interest.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tensor classification is gaining importance across fields, yet handling partially observed data remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to tensor classification with incomplete data, framed within high-dimensional tensor linear discriminant analysis. Specifically, we consider a high-dimensional tensor predictor with missing observations under the Missing Completely at Random (MCR) assumption and employ the Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model (TGMM) to capture the relationship between the tensor predictor and class label. We propose a Tensor Linear Discriminant Analysis with Missing Data (Tensor LDA-MD) algorithm, which manages high-dimensional tensor predictors with missing entries by leveraging the decomposable low-rank structure of the discriminant tensor. Our work establishes convergence rates for the estimation error of the discriminant tensor with incomplete data and minimax optimal bounds for the misclassification rate, addressing key gaps in the literature. Additionally, we derive large deviation bounds for the generalized mode-wise sample covariance matrix and its inverse, which are crucial tools in our analysis and hold independent interest. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in simulations and real data analysis, even with significant proportions of missing data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mingyuan Zhou, Huangjie Zheng, Yi Gu, Zhendong Wang, Hai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Score identity Distillation (SiD) is a data-free method that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in image generation by leveraging only a pretrained diffusion model, without requiring any training data. However, the ultimate performance of SiD is constrained by the accuracy with which the pretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator, boosting its ability to distinguish between real images and those generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates the average "fakeness" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator either from scratch or by fine-tuning an existing one. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor when trained from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model's performance after an initial warmup period during fine-tuning from a pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method establishes new benchmarks in generation performance when distilling EDM diffusion models pretrained on CIFAR-10 (32x32) and ImageNet (64x64), achieving FID score of 1.110 on ImageNet 64x64. It sets record-low FID scores when distilling EDM2 models trained on ImageNet (512x512), surpassing even the largest teacher model, EDM2-XXL. Our SiDA's results record FID scores of 2.156 for EDM2-XS, 1.669 for EDM2-S, 1.488 for EDM2-M, and 1.465 for EDM2-L, demonstrating significant improvements across all model sizes. Our open-source code will be integrated into the SiD codebase.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qibang Liu, Pengfei Cai, Diab Abueidda, Sagar Vyas, Seid Koric, Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli, Philippe Geubelle</p>
<p>Abstract: Under some initial and boundary conditions, the rapid reaction-thermal diffusion process taking place during frontal polymerization (FP) destabilizes the planar mode of front propagation, leading to spatially varying, complex hierarchical patterns in thermoset polymeric materials. Although modern reaction-diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP, the inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that produce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique and non-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. In this work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariate conditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of hierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodes both the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the design space. In the encoder of the UcVAE, the number of training parameters is significantly reduced compared to the cVAE, resulting in a shorter training time while maintaining comparable performance. Given desired pattern images, the trained UcVAE can generate multiple process condition solutions that produce high-fidelity hierarchical patterns.</p>

Our Bayesian evidence estimates run on $1$ GPU are consistent with traditional nested sampling techniques run on $16$ CPU cores, while reducing the computation time by factors of $5\times$ and $15\times$ for $4$-dimensional and $11$-dimensional gravitational wave inference problems, respectively. Our code is available in well-tested and thoroughly documented open-source packages, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility for the wider research community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dimitrios G. Patsatzis, Mario di Bernardo, Lucia Russo, Constantinos Siettos</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GoRINNs: numerical analysis-informed neural networks for the solution of inverse problems of non-linear systems of conservation laws. GoRINNs are based on high-resolution Godunov schemes for the solution of the Riemann problem in hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). In contrast to other existing machine learning methods that learn the numerical fluxes of conservative Finite Volume methods, GoRINNs learn the physical flux function per se. Due to their structure, GoRINNs provide interpretable, conservative schemes, that learn the solution operator on the basis of approximate Riemann solvers that satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot condition. The performance of GoRINNs is assessed via four benchmark problems, namely the Burgers', the Shallow Water, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards and the Payne-Whitham traffic flow models. The solution profiles of these PDEs exhibit shock waves, rarefactions and/or contact discontinuities at finite times. We demonstrate that GoRINNs provide a very high accuracy both in the smooth and discontinuous regions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhong Lin, Cheng-En Wu, Yibing Wei, Pedro Morgado</p>
<p>Abstract: Our work tackles the computational challenges of contrastive learning methods, particularly for the pretraining of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Despite the effectiveness of contrastive learning, the substantial computational resources required for training often hinder their practical application. To mitigate this issue, we propose an acceleration framework, leveraging ViT's unique ability to generalize across inputs of varying sequence lengths. Our method employs a mix of sequence compression strategies, including randomized token dropout and flexible patch scaling, to reduce the cost of gradient estimation and accelerate convergence. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the gradient estimation error of various acceleration strategies as well as their impact on downstream tasks, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between acceleration and performance.
  We also propose a novel procedure to identify an optimal acceleration schedule to adjust the sequence compression ratios to the training progress, ensuring efficient training without sacrificing downstream performance. Our approach significantly reduces computational overhead across various self-supervised learning algorithms on large-scale datasets. In ImageNet, our method achieves speedups of 4$\times$ in MoCo, 3.3$\times$ in SimCLR, and 2.5$\times$ in DINO, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Alternative data provides valuable insights for lenders to evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness, which could help expand credit access to underserved groups and lower costs for borrowers. But some forms of alternative data have historically been excluded from credit underwriting because it could act as an illegal proxy for a protected class like race or gender, causing redlining. We propose a method for applying causal inference to a supervised machine learning model to debias alternative data so that it might be used for credit underwriting. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used against a public credit dataset to improve model accuracy across different racial groups, while providing theoretically robust nondiscrimination guarantees.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22938">DiffLight: A Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion Model for Traffic Signal Control with Missing Data</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyang Chen, Yang Jiang, Shengnan Guo, Xiaowei Mao, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan</p>
<p>Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning in traffic signal control (TSC) has been extensively researched and yielded notable achievements. However, most existing works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding intersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In real-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions or data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the needs of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data. The code of DiffLight is released at https://github.com/lokol5579/DiffLight-release.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23230">Aligning Audio-Visual Joint Representations with an Agentic Workflow</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shentong Mo, Yibing Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint representation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies develop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV data alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation. We observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference. Also, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These non-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade application performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint representations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to visual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an LLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent uses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language descriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this paired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e., planning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter noise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio signals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e., reflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to become an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual content. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV data via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The experimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse downstream tasks.</p>
