<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo G. Almeida, Guilherme A. L. Silva, Val\'eria Santos, Gladston Moreira, Pedro Silva, Eduardo Luz</p>
<p>Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide, leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning (ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE) on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration, GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmoy Biswas, Nafis Faisal, Vivek Chowdhury, Abrar Al-Shadid Abir, Sabir Mahmud, Mithon Rahman, Shaikh Anowarul Fattah, Hafiz Imtiaz</p>
<p>Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset, often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline, moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS), if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models, we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14071">Edge-Selector Model Applied for Local Search Neighborhood for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Bachtiar Herdianto, Romain Billot, Flavien Lucas, Marc Sevaux, Daniele Vigo</p>
<p>Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants, including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000 customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the observed improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anabel Yong</p>
<p>Abstract: We present GP-MOBO, a novel multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm that advances the state-of-the-art in molecular optimization. Our approach integrates a fast minimal package for Exact Gaussian Processes (GPs) capable of efficiently handling the full dimensionality of sparse molecular fingerprints without the need for extensive computational resources. GP-MOBO consistently outperforms traditional methods like GP-BO by fully leveraging fingerprint dimensionality, leading to the identification of higher-quality and valid SMILES. Moreover, our model achieves a broader exploration of the chemical search space, as demonstrated by its superior proximity to the Pareto front in all tested scenarios. Empirical results from the DockSTRING dataset reveal that GP-MOBO yields higher geometric mean values across 20 Bayesian optimization iterations, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in addressing complex multi-objective optimization challenges with minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Zhang, Ruilin Zhang, Jun Xiao, Yifan Liu, Zhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97 and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Zhang, Ruilin Zhang, Biaokai Zhu, Xun Han, Jun Xiao, Yifan Liu, Zhe Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengdi Li, Guanqiao Chen, Xufeng Zhao, Haochen Wen, Shu Yang, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck. Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14078">Out-of-Sample Hydrocarbon Production Forecasting: Time Series Machine Learning using Productivity Index-Driven Features and Inductive Conformal Prediction</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Hassan Abdalla Idris, Jakub Marek Cebula, Jebraeel Gholinezhad, Shamsul Masum, Hongjie Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve (wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H). All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g., 95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14079">A Guide to Robust Generalization: The Impact of Architecture, Pre-training, and Optimization Strategy</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxime Heuillet, Rishika Bhagwatkar, Jonas Ngnaw\'e, Yann Pequignot, Alexandre Larouche, Christian Gagn\'e, Irina Rish, Ola Ahmad, Audrey Durand</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size, and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these design choices influence generalization remains an open question with significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3 adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200 robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date. While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising research directions and offering practical guidance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14080">KnowDR-REC: A Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension with Real-World Knowledge</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanghao Jin, Jingpei Wu, Tianpei Guo, Yiyi Niu, Weidong Zhou, Guoyang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models, traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC, characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image. Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning. We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal systems for complex real-world scenarios.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14081">Toward Lifelong Learning in Equilibrium Propagation: Sleep-like and Awake Rehearsal for Enhanced Stability</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoshimasa Kubo, Jean Erik Delanois, Maxim Bazhenov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP), a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model (MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets. Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors into artificial neural networks (ANNs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Su, Hezhe Qiao, Wei Huang, Lin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently received considerable attention across various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Songyu Ke, Chenyu Wu, Yuxuan Liang, Xiuwen Yi, Yanping Sun, Junbo Zhang, Yu Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI. This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanseul Kang, Shervin Karimkashi, Ville Vuorinen</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries; memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} = 0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$, corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.</p>

Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases. In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Park, Shuhang Li, Yi Huang, Xihaier Luo, Haiwang Yu, Yeonju Go, Christopher Pinkenburg, Yuewei Lin, Shinjae Yoo, Joseph Osborn, Jin Huang, Yihui Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However, applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single linear mapping for different downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haomin Wen, Shurui Cao, Leman Akoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge. Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences (CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Morris, David J. Tena Cucala, Bernardo Cuenca Grau</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction: predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Ajeleye, Ashutosh Trivedi, Majid Zamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines (pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable, expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Pikus, Pratyush Ranjan Tiwari, Burton Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training: prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks when using GRPO.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14101">Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Choudhuri, Yongjian Zhong, Bijaya Adhikari</p>
<p>Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains, including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14102">Beyond Fixed Morphologies: Learning Graph Policies with Trust Region Compensation in Variable Action Spaces</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Gallien</p>
<p>Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study morphological generalization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from specialized computational tools into autonomous research partners. We position Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm, where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency. Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives -- process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i) trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a domain-oriented synthesis of autonomous scientific discovery and positions Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14125">A Cost-Effective Framework for Predicting Parking Availability Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Madyan Bagosher, Tala Mustafa, Mohammad Alsmirat, Amal Al-Ali, Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh</p>
<p>Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps, mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142 and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S. Josyula, Y. Noiman, E. J. Payton, T. Giovannelli</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target. The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms. Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be made with limited data.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134">ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Wu, Fei Teng, Ji Zhang, Xingwang Li, Yuxuan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Collins O. Ogbodo, Timothy J. Rogers, Mattia Dal Borgo, David J. Wagg</p>
<p>Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations, this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amalie Roark, Serio Agriesti, Francisco Camara Pereira, Guido Cantelmo</p>
<p>Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Donghwa Kang, Doohyun Kim, Sang-Ki Ko, Jinkyu Lee, Brent ByungHoon Kang, Hyeongboo Baek</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn, allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes. Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost, functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization. Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically, ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet, a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST) mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer computations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning: whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>

While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Xu, Tsui-Wei Weng, Lam M. Nguyen, Tengfei Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust in performance across different training and architecture settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liyi Zhang, Jake Snell, Thomas L. Griffiths</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However, it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and expected calibration error.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amirmohsen Sattarifard, Sepehr Lavasani, Ehsan Imani, Kunlin Zhang, Hanlin Xu, Fengyu Sun, Negar Hassanpour, Chao Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive, prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality. Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics. Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary predictors or adding any inference overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Can Jin, Yang Zhou, Qixin Zhang, Hongwu Peng, Di Zhang, Marco Pavone, Ligong Han, Zhang-Wei Hong, Tong Che, Dimitris N. Metaxas</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pritthijit Nath, Sebastian Schemm, Henry Moss, Peter Haynes, Emily Shuckburgh, Mark Webb</p>
<p>Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble (ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a changing climate.

<p><b>Authors:</b> N\'icolas Roque dos Santos, Dawon Ahn, Diego Minatel, Alneu de Andrade Lopes, Evangelos E. Papalexakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xu Weng, K. V. Ling, Haochen Liu, Bingheng Wang, Kun Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance for mobile devices.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14338">On the Interplay between Graph Structure and Learning Algorithms in Graph Neural Networks</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei Su, Chuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk (generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions, \emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and selection in practice.}</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However, existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed, highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingkai Kong, Haichuan Wang, Charles A. Emogor, Vincent B\"orsch-Supan, Lily Xu, Milind Tambe</p>
<p>Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14351">A Non-Asymptotic Convergent Analysis for Scored-Based Graph Generative Model via a System of Stochastic Differential Equations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei Su, Chuan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2) graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains, and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14352">SBGD: Improving Graph Diffusion Generative Model via Stochastic Block Diffusion</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Junwei Su, Shan Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization, with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion (SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space. This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns, significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kim Hammar, Tao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL: Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available, which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.</p>

<p>Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models. We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on two different datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ajan Subramanian, Amir M. Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring, yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy (e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility (median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes, showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on individual responses to lifestyle changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuaijie She, Yu Bao, Yu Lu, Lu Xu, Tao Li, Wenhao Zhu, Shujian Huang, Shanbo Cheng, Lu Lu, Yuxuan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g., translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information (e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically, DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks, and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14481">Fast Symbolic Regression Benchmarking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Viktor Martinek</p>
<p>Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms. However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%. Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14482">On the notion of missingness for path attribution explainability methods in medical settings: Guiding the selection of medically meaningful baselines</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Geiger, Lars Wagner, Daniel Rueckert, Dirk Wilhelm, Alissa Jell</p>
<p>Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge, particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline choices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huan Ma, Jiadong Pan, Jing Liu, Yan Chen, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Guangyu Wang, Qinghua Hu, Hua Wu, Changqing Zhang, Haifeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Majid Mohammadi, Krikamol Muandet, Ilaria Tiddi, Annette Ten Teije, Siu Lun Chau</p>
<p>Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features, severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only, capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic) M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable, axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions generated by structured probabilistic models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lian Lian, Yilin Li, Song Han, Renzi Meng, Sibo Wang, Ming Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kevin Riehl, Shaimaa K. El-Baklish, Anastasios Kouvelas, Michail A. Makridis</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saman Yazdannik, Morteza Tayefi, Shamim Sanisales</p>
<p>Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tao Shen, Zexi Li, Didi Zhu, Ziyu Zhao, Chao Wu, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in cross-device settings.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544">Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixi Chen, Yinyu Ye, Zijie Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore, it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler, highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumya Sarkar, Shweta Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abdalwahab Almajed, Maryam Tabar, Peyman Najafirad</p>
<p>Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However, there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further research to enhance their reliability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Wang, Guoming Tang, Junyu Xue, Srinivasan Keshav, Tongxin Li, Chris Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture, DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Sales Corr\^ea, Suryanarayana Sankagiri, Daniel Ratton Figueiredo, Matthias Grossglauser</p>
<p>Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them. Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets. These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account for such context effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amin Noroozi, Sandaruwan K. Sethunge, Elham Norouzi, Phat T. Phan, Kavinda U. Waduge, Md. Arafatur Rahman</p>
<p>Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI) framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores, were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying operational conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luis H. John, Jan A. Kors, Jenna M. Reps, Peter R. Rijnbeek, Egill A. Fridgeirsson</p>
<p>Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models, particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoru Tan, Sitong Wu, Xiuzhe Wu, Wang Wang, Bo Zhao, Zeke Xie, Gui-Song Xia, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization. However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex. These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data points and outperforms strong baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengyi Wo, Chang Liu, Yumeng Wang, Minglai Shao, Wenjun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender. Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zengyi Wo, Wenjun Wang, Minglai Shao, Chang Liu, Yumeng Wang, Yueheng Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently, various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.</p>

<p>Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns. Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy, and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for future research.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanggeon Yun, Raheeb Hassan, Ryozo Masukawa, Mohsen Imani</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating our approach as an effective pre-processing step.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunzhe Zhang, Yifei Wang, Khanh Vinh Nguyen, Pengyu Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities: molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Carta, Cl\'ement Romac, Loris Gaven, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Olivier Sigaud, Sylvain Lamprier</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruheng Wang, Hang Zhang, Trieu Nguyen, Shasha Feng, Hao-Wei Pang, Xiang Yu, Li Xiao, Peter Zhiping Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ahmed Mujtaba, Gleb Radchenko, Radu Prodan, Marc Masana</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios, including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients, without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The code is available online for reproducibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guillermo Sarasa Dur\'an, Ana Granados Fontecha, Francisco de Borja Rodr\'iguez Ort\'iz</p>
<p>Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods. Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific objective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suleyman Olcay Polat, Poli A. Nemkova, Mark V. Albert</p>
<p>Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3% on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and effective model compression.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Azim Ahmadzadeh, Rohan Adhyapak, Armin Iraji, Kartik Chaurasiya, V Aparna, Petrus C. Martens</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of manual annotation projects across various fields.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zifan Wang, Alice Harting, Matthieu Barreau, Michael M. Zavlanos, Karl H. Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework, which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field. The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks, image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen-Hao Chang, Hui-Ju Hung, Chia-Hsun Lu, Chih-Ya Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach, named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA), that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art link prediction models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihao Andreas Lin, Nicolas Mayoraz, Steffen Rendle, Dima Kuzmin, Emil Praun, Berivan Isik</p>
<p>Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However, the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data. However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Su Hyeong Lee, Richard Ngo</p>
<p>Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models, each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajib Biswas, Mao Nishino, Samuel Jacob Chacko, Xiuwen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness. We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs. Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of optimized suffixes to different LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges: effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization. GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets; they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting, with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jyotirmai Singh, Samar Khanna, James Burgess</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis - consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Preston Fu, Oleh Rybkin, Zhiyuan Zhou, Michal Nauman, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Aviral Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online, value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning but adapted to TD learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kartik Pandey, Arun Balasubramanian, Debasis Samanta</p>
<p>Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive, low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse EEG-based applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our company, one of the large fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily contests and millions of players, where online experiments show a marked improvement over other candidate models in terms of recall and other critical business metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sonakshi Chauhan, Maheep Chaudhary, Koby Choy, Samuel Nellessen, Nandi Schoots</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g., subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs and have implications for interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ishaan Mahapatra, Nihar R. Mahapatra</p>
<p>Abstract: Voice biomarkers--human-generated acoustic signals such as speech, coughing, and breathing--are promising tools for scalable, non-invasive detection and monitoring of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, their clinical adoption remains constrained by inconsistent quality and limited usability of publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we present the first systematic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) evaluation of 27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets focused on these disease areas. Using the FAIR Data Maturity Model and a structured, priority-weighted scoring method, we assessed FAIRness at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels. Our analysis revealed consistently high Findability but substantial variability and weaknesses in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Mental health datasets exhibited greater variability in FAIR scores, while neurodegenerative datasets were slightly more consistent. Repository choice also significantly influenced FAIRness scores. To enhance dataset quality and clinical utility, we recommend adopting structured, domain-specific metadata standards, prioritizing FAIR-compliant repositories, and routinely applying structured FAIR evaluation frameworks. These findings provide actionable guidance to improve dataset interoperability and reuse, thereby accelerating the clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Leeney, Alessio Gravina, Davide Bacciu</p>
<p>Abstract: Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jolanta Mozyrska, Marcel Beetz, Luke Melas-Kyriazi, Vicente Grau, Abhirup Banerjee, Alfonso Bueno-Orovio</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials, electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction) cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean compared to the gold standard.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Thimonier, Antony Perzo, Renaud Seguier</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task that requires capturing both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with critical applications in human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent works have highlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks outside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches have investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained backbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach that fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion prediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature extractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a learnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio features, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the transcript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task. To efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This highlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for speech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinhua Chen, Sitao Huang, Cong Guo, Chiyue Wei, Yintao He, Jianyi Zhang, Hai "Hellen" Li, Yiran Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to $\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence inference.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gaurav Bhatt, Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil, Tanmay Gangwani, Tesi Xiao, Leonid Sigal</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank, first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$, using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii) $\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior dynamics for utility-optimized ranking.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md Ashiqur Rahman, Chiao-An Yang, Michael N. Cheng, Lim Jun Hao, Jeremiah Jiang, Teck-Yian Lim, Raymond A. Yeh</p>
<p>Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixin Rao, Youssef Mohamed, Shang Liu, Zeyan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship attribution.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie, Luis Rueda</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data. In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the regular GCN.</p>

<p>Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$, there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability, $(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya and van Handel, GAFA 2024].</p>

<p>Abstract: Feature selection and importance estimation in a model-agnostic setting is an ongoing challenge of significant interest. Wrapper methods are commonly used because they are typically model-agnostic, even though they are computationally intensive. In this paper, we focus on feature selection methods related to the Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO) estimation, and provide a comparison based on relative efficiency. In particular, we present a theoretical comparison under three model settings: linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models that mimic a single-layer neural network. We complement this with extensive simulations and real data examples. Our theoretical results, along with empirical findings, demonstrate that GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable regularity conditions. Furthermore, we quantify the asymptotic relative efficiency of these approaches. Our simulations and real data analysis include widely used machine learning methods such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles, ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations: 1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation, Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications. In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints. Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haitong Ma, Bo Dai, Zhaolin Ren, Yebin Wang, Na Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to walk from a few real-world demonstrations.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guilhem Faur\'e (MULTISPEECH), Mostafa Sadeghi (MULTISPEECH), Sam Bigeard (MULTISPEECH), Slim Ouni (LORIA, MULTISPEECH)</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity, aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based SLP models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN (https://github.com/yucongzh/SIREN), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junying Chen, Zhenyang Cai, Zhiheng Liu, Yunjin Yang, Rongsheng Wang, Qingying Xiao, Xiangyi Feng, Zhan Su, Jing Guo, Xiang Wan, Guangjun Yu, Haizhou Li, Benyou Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2) the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking, listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abbas Sabra, Olivier Schmitt, Joseph Tyler</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells. These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangyi He, Tobias Sutter, Lukas Gonon</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies under distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks. We first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to small perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training framework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our approach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting and introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial optimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient training of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional perturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that adversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their classical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to model misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bego\~na B. Sierra, Colin McLean, Peter S. Hall, Catalina A. Vallejos</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring. Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse, providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing software.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Josh Barua, Seun Eisape, Kayo Yin, Alane Suhr</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third, data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.</p>

<p>Abstract: When using medical images for diagnosis, either by clinicians or artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is important that the images are of high quality. When an image is of low quality, the medical exam that produced the image often needs to be redone. In telemedicine, a common problem is that the quality issue is only flagged once the patient has left the clinic, meaning they must return in order to have the exam redone. This can be especially difficult for people living in remote regions, who make up a substantial portion of the patients at Portal Telemedicina, a digital healthcare organization based in Brazil. In this paper, we report on ongoing work regarding (i) the development of an AI system for flagging and explaining low-quality medical images in real-time, (ii) an interview study to understand the explanation needs of stakeholders using the AI system at OurCompany, and, (iii) a longitudinal user study design to examine the effect of including explanations on the workflow of the technicians in our clinics. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the first longitudinal study on evaluating the effects of XAI methods on end-users -- stakeholders that use AI systems but do not have AI-specific expertise. We welcome feedback and suggestions on our experimental setup.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this study, a radiomics approach was extended to optical fluorescence molecular imaging data for tissue classification, termed 'optomics'. Fluorescence molecular imaging is emerging for precise surgical guidance during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) resection. However, the tumor-to-normal tissue contrast is confounded by intrinsic physiological limitations of heterogeneous expression of the target molecule, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Optomics seek to improve tumor identification by probing textural pattern differences in EGFR expression conveyed by fluorescence. A total of 1,472 standardized optomic features were extracted from fluorescence image samples. A supervised machine learning pipeline involving a support vector machine classifier was trained with 25 top-ranked features selected by minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion. Model predictive performance was compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method by classifying testing set image patches of resected tissue with histologically confirmed malignancy status. The optomics approach provided consistent improvement in prediction accuracy on all test set samples, irrespective of dose, compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method (mean accuracies of 89% vs. 81%; P = 0.0072). The improved performance demonstrates that extending the radiomics approach to fluorescence molecular imaging data offers a promising image analysis technique for cancer detection in fluorescence-guided surgery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Apicella, Francesco Isgr\`o, Roberto Prevete</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized various domains, offering predictive capabilities in several areas. However, with the increasing accessibility of ML tools, many practitioners, lacking deep ML expertise, adopt a "push the button" approach, utilizing user-friendly interfaces without a thorough understanding of underlying algorithms. While this approach provides convenience, it raises concerns about the reliability of outcomes, leading to challenges such as incorrect performance evaluation. This paper addresses a critical issue in ML, known as data leakage, where unintended information contaminates the training data, impacting model performance evaluation. Users, due to a lack of understanding, may inadvertently overlook crucial steps, leading to optimistic performance estimates that may not hold in real-world scenarios. The discrepancy between evaluated and actual performance on new data is a significant concern. In particular, this paper categorizes data leakage in ML, discussing how certain conditions can propagate through the ML workflow. Furthermore, it explores the connection between data leakage and the specific task being addressed, investigates its occurrence in Transfer Learning, and compares standard inductive ML with transductive ML frameworks. The conclusion summarizes key findings, emphasizing the importance of addressing data leakage for robust and reliable ML applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adrien Bolland, Gaspard Lambrechts, Damien Ernst</p>
<p>Abstract: In order to compute near-optimal policies with policy-gradient algorithms, it is common in practice to include intrinsic exploration terms in the learning objective. Although the effectiveness of these terms is usually justified by an intrinsic need to explore environments, we propose a novel analysis with the lens of numerical optimization. Two criteria are introduced on the learning objective and two others on its stochastic gradient estimates, and are afterwards used to discuss the quality of the policy after optimization. The analysis sheds light on two separate effects of exploration techniques. First, they make it possible to smooth the learning objective and to eliminate local optima while preserving the global maximum. Second, they modify the gradient estimates, increasing the probability that the stochastic parameter updates eventually provide an optimal policy. We empirically illustrate these effects with exploration strategies based on entropy bonuses, identifying limitations and suggesting directions for future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahareh Tasdighi, Manuel Haussmann, Nicklas Werge, Yi-Shan Wu, Melih Kandemir</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real-world applications. Many complex skills are based on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor must learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, an agent must perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-softly on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named {\it PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC)}, is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Chen, Faiek Ahsan, Johannes Leugering, Gert Cauwenberghs, Shantanu Chakrabartty</p>
<p>Abstract: Neuromorphic or neurally-inspired optimizers rely on local but parallel parameter updates to solve problems that range from quadratic programming to Ising machines. An ideal realization of such an optimizer not only uses a compute-in-memory (CIM) paradigm to address the so-called memory-wall (i.e. energy dissipated due to repeated memory read access), but also uses a learning-in-memory (LIM) paradigm to address the energy bottlenecks due to repeated memory writes at the precision required for optimization (the update-wall), and to address the energy bottleneck due to the repeated transfer of information between short-term and long-term memories (the consolidation-wall). In this paper, we derive theoretical estimates for the energy-to-solution metric that can be achieved by this ideal neuromorphic optimizer which is realized by modulating the energy-barrier of the physical memories such that the dynamics of memory updates and memory consolidation matches the optimization or the annealing dynamics. The analysis presented in this paper captures the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics of learning and the resulting energy-efficiency estimates are model-agnostic which only depend on the number of model-update operations (OPS), the model-size in terms of number of parameters, the speed of convergence, and the precision of the solution. To show the practical applicability of our results, we apply our analysis for estimating the lower-bound on the energy-to-solution metrics for large-scale AI workloads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vinod Kumar Chauhan, Lei Clifton, Achille Sala\"un, Huiqi Yvonne Lu, Kim Branson, Patrick Schwab, Gaurav Nigam, David A. Clifton</p>
<p>Abstract: While machine learning algorithms hold promise for personalised medicine, their clinical adoption remains limited, partly due to biases that can compromise the reliability of predictions. In this paper, we focus on sample selection bias (SSB), a specific type of bias where the study population is less representative of the target population, leading to biased and potentially harmful decisions. Despite being well-known in the literature, SSB remains scarcely studied in machine learning for healthcare. Moreover, the existing machine learning techniques try to correct the bias mostly by balancing distributions between the study and the target populations, which may result in a loss of predictive performance. To address these problems, our study illustrates the potential risks associated with SSB by examining SSB's impact on the performance of machine learning algorithms. Most importantly, we propose a new research direction for addressing SSB, based on the target population identification rather than the bias correction. Specifically, we propose two independent networks(T-Net) and a multitasking network (MT-Net) for addressing SSB, where one network/task identifies the target subpopulation which is representative of the study population and the second makes predictions for the identified subpopulation. Our empirical results with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets highlight that SSB can lead to a large drop in the performance of an algorithm for the target population as compared with the study population, as well as a substantial difference in the performance for the target subpopulations that are representative of the selected and the non-selected patients from the study population. Furthermore, our proposed techniques demonstrate robustness across various settings, including different dataset sizes, event rates, and selection rates, outperforming the existing bias correction techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Klaudia Ba{\l}azy, Mohammadreza Banaei, Karl Aberer, Jacek Tabor</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth of large language models underscores the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Despite its popularity, LoRA encounters storage and computational challenges when deploying multiple task- or user-specific modules. To address this, we introduce LoRA-XS, a novel fine-tuning method backed by a theoretical derivation. LoRA-XS drastically reduces trainable parameters by incorporating a small, trainable weight matrix between frozen low-rank matrices derived from the Singular Value Decomposition of pre-trained weights. This design enables LoRA-XS to reduce storage requirements by over 100x in 7B models compared to LoRA. Additionally, unlike other methods, LoRA-XS imposes no lower bound on trainable parameters - it can scale from a single parameter per module to arbitrarily large values, adapting to any storage or computational constraint. Evaluations on GLUE, GSM8K, MATH, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks across different model scales reveal that LoRA-XS consistently outperforms or matches LoRA and VeRA in accuracy, offering unmatched parameter efficiency. Our ablation studies highlight the significance of singular vectors in transformer weights, establishing LoRA-XS as a powerful, storage-efficient solution for scaling and personalizing large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahareh Tasdighi, Nicklas Werge, Yi-Shan Wu, Melih Kandemir</p>
<p>Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic algorithms have shown strong potential in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. Their success primarily comes from leveraging pessimistic state-action value function updates, which reduce function approximation errors and stabilize learning. However, excessive pessimism can limit exploration, preventing the agent from effectively refining its policies. Conversely, optimism can encourage exploration but may lead to high-risk behaviors and unstable learning if not carefully managed. To address this trade-off, we propose Utility Soft Actor-Critic (USAC), a novel framework that allows independent, interpretable control of pessimism and optimism for both the actor and the critic. USAC dynamically adapts its exploration strategy based on the uncertainty of critics using a utility function, enabling a task-specific balance between optimism and pessimism. This approach goes beyond binary choices of pessimism or optimism, making the method both theoretically meaningful and practically feasible. Experiments across a variety of continuous control tasks show that adjusting the degree of pessimism or optimism significantly impacts performance. When configured appropriately, USAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its practical utility and feasibility.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utsav Singh, Pramit Bhattacharyya, Vinay P. Namboodiri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in logical reasoning, in-context learning, and code generation. However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ningyi Liao, Haoyu Liu, Zulun Zhu, Siqiang Luo, Laks V. S. Lakshmanan</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), spectral GNNs have received increasing popularity by virtue of their ability to retrieve graph signals in the spectral domain. These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings.
  In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kathryn T. Farrell, Kirsten Ziman, Michael S. A. Graziano</p>
<p>Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the brain uses an attention schema, or a simplified model of attention, to help control what it attends to. One proposed benefit of this model is to allow agents to model the attention states of other agents, and thus predict and interact with other agents. The effects of an attention schema may be examined in artificial agents. Although attention mechanisms in artificial agents are different from in biological brains, there may be some principles in common. In both cases, select features or representations are emphasized for better performance. Here, using neural networks with transformer attention mechanisms, we asked whether the addition of an attention schema affected the ability of agents to make judgements about and cooperate with each other. First, we found that an agent with an attention schema is better at categorizing the attention states of other agents (higher accuracy). Second, an agent with an attention schema develops a pattern of attention that is easier for other agents to categorize. Third, in a joint task where two agents must predict each other to paint a scene together, adding an attention schema improves performance. Finally, the performance improvements are not caused by a general increase in network complexity. Instead, improvement is specific to tasks involving judging, categorizing, or predicting the attention of other agents. These results support the hypothesis that an attention schema has computational properties beneficial to mutual interpretability and interactive behavior. We speculate that the same principles might pertain to biological attention and attention schemas in people.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haochen Song, Ilya Musabirov, Ananya Bhattacharjee, Audrey Durand, Meredith Franklin, Anna Rafferty, Joseph Jay Williams</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive experimentation is increasingly used in educational platforms to personalize learning through dynamic content and feedback. However, standard adaptive strategies such as Thompson Sampling often underperform in real-world educational settings where content variations are numerous and student participation is limited, resulting in sparse data. In particular, Thompson Sampling can lead to imbalanced content allocation and delayed convergence on which aspects of content are most effective for student learning. To address these challenges, we introduce Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS), an algorithm that refines the sampling strategy to improve content-related decision-making in data-sparse environments. WAPTS is guided by the principle of lenient regret, allowing near-optimal allocations to accelerate learning while still exploring promising content. We evaluate WAPTS in a learnersourcing scenario where students rate peer-generated learning materials, and demonstrate that it enables earlier and more reliable identification of promising treatments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nir Ben-Ari, Amitai Yacobi, Uri Shaham</p>
<p>Abstract: Spectral Embedding (SE) is a popular method for dimensionality reduction, applicable across diverse domains. Nevertheless, its current implementations face three prominent drawbacks which curtail its broader applicability: generalizability (i.e., out-of-sample extension), scalability, and eigenvectors separation. Existing SE implementations often address two of these drawbacks; however, they fall short in addressing the remaining one. In this paper, we introduce Sep-SpectralNet (eigenvector-separated SpectralNet), a SE implementation designed to address all three limitations. Sep-SpectralNet extends SpectralNet with an efficient post-processing step to achieve eigenvectors separation, while ensuring both generalizability and scalability. This method expands the applicability of SE to a wider range of tasks and can enhance its performance in existing applications. We empirically demonstrate Sep-SpectralNet's ability to consistently approximate and generalize SE, while maintaining SpectralNet's scalability. Additionally, we show how Sep-SpectralNet can be leveraged to enable generalizable UMAP visualization. Our codes are publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Corinna Coupette, Jeremy Wayland, Emily Simons, Bastian Rieck</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06768">Train for the Worst, Plan for the Best: Understanding Token Ordering in Masked Diffusions</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyeon Kim, Kulin Shah, Vasilis Kontonis, Sham Kakade, Sitan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative approach for generative modeling over discrete domains. Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilja Kuzborskij, Yasin Abbasi Yadkori</p>
<p>Abstract: We explore the low-rank structure of the weight matrices in neural networks at the stationary points (limiting solutions of optimization algorithms) with $L2$ regularization (also known as weight decay). We show several properties of such deep neural networks, induced by $L2$ regularization. In particular, for a stationary point we show alignment of the parameters and the gradient, norm preservation across layers, and low-rank bias: properties previously known in the context of solution of gradient descent/flow type algorithms. Experiments show that the assumptions made in the analysis only mildly affect the observations.
  In addition, we investigate a multitask learning phenomenon enabled by $L2$ regularization and low-rank bias. In particular, we show that if two networks are trained, such that the inputs in the training set of one network are approximately orthogonal to the inputs in the training set of the other network, the new network obtained by simply summing the weights of the two networks will perform as well on both training sets as the respective individual networks. We demonstrate this for shallow ReLU neural networks trained by gradient descent, as well as deep linear networks trained by gradient flow.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoyang Li, Yixuan Jiang, Junze Zhu, Haotian Tang, Dongchen Wu, Hanyu Liu, Chao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: In the field of sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), deep neural networks provide advanced technical support. Many studies have proven that recognition accuracy can be improved by increasing the depth or width of the network. However, for wearable devices, the balance between network performance and resource consumption is crucial. With minimum resource consumption as the basic principle, we propose a universal attention feature purification mechanism, called MSAP, which is suitable for multi-scale networks. The mechanism effectively solves the feature redundancy caused by the superposition of multi-scale features by means of inter-scale attention screening and connection method. In addition, we have designed a network correction module that integrates seamlessly between layers of individual network modules to mitigate inherent problems in deep networks. We also built an embedded deployment system that is in line with the current level of wearable technology to test the practical feasibility of the HAR model, and further prove the efficiency of the method. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed method model effectively reduces redundant features in filtered data and provides excellent performance with little resource consumption.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have provided new opportunities for decision-making, particularly in the task of automated feature selection. In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate LLM-based feature selection methods, covering the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4.5. Then, we propose a new hybrid strategy called LLM4FS that integrates LLMs with traditional data-driven methods. Specifically, input data samples into LLMs, and directly call traditional data-driven techniques such as random forest and forward sequential selection. Notably, our analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods. Finally, we point out the limitations of its application in decision-making. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/LLM4FS.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinhui Pang, Changqing Lin, Hao Lin, Zhihui Zhang, Weiping Ding, Yu Liu, Xiaoshuai Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, neural networks have gained attention for creating parametric and invertible multidimensional data projections. Parametric projections allow for embedding previously unseen data without recomputing the projection as a whole, while invertible projections enable the generation of new data points. However, these properties have never been explored simultaneously for arbitrary projection methods. We evaluate three autoencoder (AE) architectures for creating parametric and invertible projections. Based on a given projection, we train AEs to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping into the original space. We perform a quantitative and qualitative comparison on four datasets of varying dimensionality and pattern complexity using t-SNE. Our results indicate that AEs with a customized loss function can create smoother parametric and inverse projections than feed-forward neural networks while giving users control over the strength of the smoothing effect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Warren, Mark Dras</p>
<p>Abstract: Model Cascading, recently applied successfully to LLMs, is a simple but powerful technique that improves the efficiency of inference by selectively applying models of varying sizes. Models are used in sequence from smallest to largest, only deferring samples to large, costly models when smaller models are not sufficiently confident. Existing approaches to deferral use only limited small model confidence estimates because of the inaccessibility of the large model, although large model confidence is known to be important. We therefore propose a bi-directional approach to deferral that considers the confidence of small and large models in the cascade simultaneously through the use of a proxy for the large model. This requires a richer representation of model confidence to enable comparative calibration: we use an analysis of hidden states to improve post-invocation confidence of the small model, which in itself improves cascading results over prior approaches. We then combine this with a tiny proxy model to estimate pre-invocation confidence of the large model. We examine the proposed cascading system over challenging, multiple-choice datasets, finding improvements over standard cascading baselines reflected in reductions in deferrals to more costly models.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the approximation capabilities and on-convergence behaviors of one-layer transformers on the noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning of next-token prediction. Existing theoretical results focus on understanding the in-context reasoning behaviors for either the first gradient step or when the number of samples is infinite. Furthermore, no convergence rates nor generalization abilities were known. Our work addresses these gaps by showing that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss of these transformers converges at linear rate to the Bayes risk. Moreover, we prove that the trained models generalize to unseen samples as well as exhibit learning behaviors that were empirically observed in previous works. Our theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xudong Wang, Ziheng Sun, Chris Ding, Jicong Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yajie Zhou, Xiaoyi Pang, Zhibo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks using decentralized data. However, real-world deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous environments in the real world.</p>

<p>Abstract: Motivated by an open direction in existing literature, we study the 1-identification problem, a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure exploration. The goal is to determine whether there exists an arm whose mean reward is at least a known threshold $\mu_0$, or to output None if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-\delta$. Degenne & Koolen 2019 has established the asymptotically tight sample complexity for the 1-identification problem, but they commented that the non-asymptotic analysis remains unclear. We design a new algorithm Sequential-Exploration-Exploitation (SEE), and conduct theoretical analysis from the non-asymptotic perspective. Novel to the literature, we achieve near optimality, in the sense of matching upper and lower bounds on the pulling complexity. The gap between the upper and lower bounds is up to a polynomial logarithmic factor. The numerical result also indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm, compared to existing benchmarks.</p>

While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minjong Cheon</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Satellite remote sensing enables a wide range of downstream applications, including habitat mapping, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous and often corrupted, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time-series data. TESSERA uses two encoders to combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, state-of-the-art performance, openness, and computation- and labelled data-efficiency will prove transformative in a wide range of ecological applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zain ul Abdeen, Ming Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xujia Wang, Yunjia Qi, Bin Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training. The source code is available at https://github.com/KlozeWang/LoSiA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huynh Dang Nguyen, Trong-Thang Pham, Ngan Le, Van Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Li, Xiuying Wang, Wenchao Xu, Haozhao Wang, Yining Qi, Jiahua Dong, Ruixuan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients, ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which, while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15431">The calculus of variations of the Transformer on the hyperspherical tangent bundle</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrew Gracyk</p>
<p>Abstract: We offer a theoretical mathematical background to Transformers through Lagrangian optimization across the token space. The Transformer, as a flow map, exists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit sphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is reasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has various empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the dynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts, we devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of variations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map induced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer can be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We invent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss optimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Transformer. The variant of the Euler-Lagrange equation we present has various appearances in literature, but, to our understanding, oftentimes not foundationally proven or under other specialized cases. Our overarching proof is new: our techniques are classical and the use of the flow map object is original. We provide several other relevant results, primarily ones specific to neural scenarios. In particular, much of our analysis will be attempting to quantify Transformer data in variational contexts under neural approximations. Calculus of variations on manifolds is a well-nourished research area, but for the Transformer specifically, it is uncharted: we lay the foundation for this area through an introduction to the Lagrangian for the Transformer.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyi Yu, Tim Pychynski, Marco F. Huber</p>
<p>Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation (CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoya Li, Xiaofei Sun, Albert Wang, Chris Shum, Jiwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual refinement.

<p>Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this, the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1 percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of 14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for 180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality. Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements, potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sajjad Saed, Babak Teimourpour</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid expansion of the fashion industry and the growing variety of products have made it increasingly challenging for users to identify compatible items on e-commerce platforms. Effective fashion recommendation systems are therefore crucial for filtering irrelevant options and suggesting suitable ones. However, simultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations remains a significant challenge, as these aspects are typically treated independently in existing studies, thereby overlooking the complex interactions between items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework named FGAT, which leverages a hierarchical graph representation together with graph attention mechanisms to address this problem. The framework constructs a three-tier graph of users, outfits, and items, integrating visual and textual features to jointly model outfit compatibility and user preferences. By dynamically weighting node importance during representation propagation, the graph attention mechanism captures key interactions and produces precise embeddings for both user preferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT outperforms strong baselines such as HFGN, achieving notable improvements in accuracy, precision, HR, recall, and NDCG. These results demonstrate that combining multimodal visual and textual features with a hierarchical graph structure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Livi</p>
<p>Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control information flow, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam, pointing to possible redundancies. Empirical simulations corroborate these claims: in canonical synthetic sequence tasks (adding, copy) we show that gates induce lag-dependent effective learning rates and directional concentration of gradient flow, with multi-gate models matching or exceeding the anisotropic structure produced by Adam. These results highlight that optimizer-driven and gate-driven adaptivity are complementary but not equivalent mechanisms. Overall, this work provides a unified dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust trainability and stability in practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Frederik L. Dennig, Daniel A. Keim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have gained interest for creating parametric and invertible projections of multidimensional data. Parametric projections make it possible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire projection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data instances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with out-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we propose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy (DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a fixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as baseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create parametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current AE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jeremy Carleton, Debajoy Mukherjee, Srinivas Shakkottai, Dileep Kalathil</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives -- such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapheal Huang (Yuming), Weilong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander S. Wein, Ahmed El Alaoui, Cristopher Moore</p>
<p>Abstract: For the tensor PCA (principal component analysis) problem, we propose a new hierarchy of increasingly powerful algorithms with increasing runtime. Our hierarchy is analogous to the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy but is instead inspired by statistical physics and related algorithms such as belief propagation and AMP (approximate message passing). Our level-$\ell$ algorithm can be thought of as a linearized message-passing algorithm that keeps track of $\ell$-wise dependencies among the hidden variables. Specifically, our algorithms are spectral methods based on the Kikuchi Hessian, which generalizes the well-studied Bethe Hessian to the higher-order Kikuchi free energies.
  It is known that AMP, the flagship algorithm of statistical physics, has substantially worse performance than SOS for tensor PCA. In this work we 'redeem' the statistical physics approach by showing that our hierarchy gives a polynomial-time algorithm matching the performance of SOS. Our hierarchy also yields a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms, and we prove that these achieve the same (conjecturally optimal) tradeoff between runtime and statistical power as SOS. Our proofs are much simpler than prior work, and also apply to the related problem of refuting random $k$-XOR formulas. The results we present here apply to tensor PCA for tensors of all orders, and to $k$-XOR when $k$ is even.
  Our methods suggest a new avenue for systematically obtaining optimal algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, and our results constitute a step toward unifying the statistical physics and sum-of-squares approaches to algorithm design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaotie Deng, Xinyan Hu, Tao Lin, Weiqiang Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: The convergence properties of learning dynamics in repeated auctions is a timely and important question, with numerous applications in, e.g., online advertising markets. This work focuses on repeated first-price auctions where bidders with fixed values learn to bid using mean-based algorithms -- a large class of online learning algorithms that include popular no-regret algorithms such as Multiplicative Weights Update and Follow the Perturbed Leader. We completely characterize the learning dynamics of mean-based algorithms, under two notions of convergence: (1) time-average: the fraction of rounds where bidders play a Nash equilibrium converges to 1; (2) last-iterate: the mixed strategy profile of bidders converges to a Nash equilibrium. Specifically, the results depend on the number of bidders with the highest value:
  - If the number is at least three, the dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, in both time-average and last-iterate.
  - If the number is two, the dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium in time-average but not necessarily last-iterate.
  - If the number is one, the dynamics may not converge to a Nash equilibrium in time-average or last-iterate.
  Our discovery opens up new possibilities in the study of the convergence of learning dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davood Karimi, Simon K. Warfield</p>
<p>Abstract: \hspace{2mm} Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) of the brain offers unique capabilities including noninvasive probing of tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. It is widely used for clinical assessment of disease and injury, and for neuroscience research. Analyzing the dMRI data to extract useful information for medical and scientific purposes can be challenging. The dMRI measurements may suffer from strong noise and artifacts, and may exhibit high inter-session and inter-scanner variability in the data, as well as inter-subject heterogeneity in brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between measurements and the phenomena of interest can be highly complex. Recent years have witnessed increasing use of machine learning methods for dMRI analysis. This manuscript aims to assess these efforts, with a focus on methods that have addressed data preprocessing and harmonization, microstructure mapping, tractography, and white matter tract analysis. We study the main findings, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing methods and suggest topics for future research. We find that machine learning may be exceptionally suited to tackle some of the difficult tasks in dMRI analysis. However, for this to happen, several shortcomings of existing methods and critical unresolved issues need to be addressed. There is a pressing need to improve evaluation practices, to increase the availability of rich training datasets and validation benchmarks, as well as model generalizability, reliability, and explainability concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinzhu Liang, Joseph M. Lukens, Sanjaya Lohani, Brian T. Kirby, Thomas A. Searles, Xin Qiu, Kody J. H. Law</p>
<p>Abstract: This work systematically compares parallel implementations of consistent (asymptotically unbiased) Bayesian deep learning algorithms: sequential Monte Carlo sampler (SMC$_\parallel$) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC$_\parallel$). We provide a proof of convergence for SMC$_\parallel$ showing that it theoretically achieves the same level of convergence as a single monolithic SMC sampler, while the reduced communication lowers wall-clock time. It is well-known that the first samples from MCMC need to be discarded to eliminate initialization bias, and that the number of discarded samples must grow like the logarithm of the number of parallel chains to control that bias for MCMC$_\parallel$. A systematic empirical numerical study on MNIST, CIFAR, and IMDb, reveals that parallel implementations of both methods perform comparably to non-parallel implementations in terms of performance and total cost, and also comparably to each other. However, both methods still require a large wall-clock time, and suffer from catastrophic non-convergence if they aren't run for long enough.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tarun Suresh, Shubham Ugare, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic</p>
<p>Abstract: We present the first in depth study on the robustness of existing watermarking techniques applied to code generated by large language models (LLMs). As LLMs increasingly contribute to software development, watermarking has emerged as a potential solution for detecting AI generated code and mitigating misuse, such as plagiarism or the automated generation of malicious programs. While previous research has demonstrated the resilience of watermarking in the text setting, our work reveals that watermarking techniques are significantly more fragile in code-based contexts. Specifically, we show that simple semantic-preserving transformations, such as variable renaming and dead code insertion, can effectively erase watermarks without altering the program's functionality. To systematically evaluate watermark robustness, we develop an algorithm that traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a watermarked program and applies a sequence of randomized, semantics-preserving transformations. Our experimental results, conducted on Python code generated by different LLMs, indicate that even minor modifications can drastically reduce watermark detectability, with true positive rates (TPR) dropping below 50% in many cases. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-arc/llm-code-watermark.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pallavi Basu, Ron Berman</p>
<p>Abstract: A/B testing is a core tool for decision-making in business experimentation, particularly in digital platforms and marketplaces. Practitioners often prioritize lift in performance metrics while seeking to control the costs of false discoveries. This paper develops a decision-theoretic framework for maximizing expected profit subject to a constraint on the cost-weighted false discovery rate (FDR). We propose an empirical Bayes approach that uses a greedy knapsack algorithm to rank experiments based on the ratio of expected lift to cost, incorporating the local false discovery rate (lfdr) as a key statistic. The resulting oracle rule is valid and rank-optimal. In large-scale settings, we establish the asymptotic validity of a data-driven implementation and demonstrate superior finite-sample performance over existing FDR-controlling methods. An application to A/B tests run on the Optimizely platform highlights the business value of the approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yingzhen Yang, Ping Li</p>
<p>Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $[\mathcal H_K]^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$~\citep{Li2024-edr-general-domain}, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\mathcal O(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization by inducing a new integral kernel of lower kernel complexity.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07978">Coupling without Communication and Drafter-Invariant Speculative Decoding</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Majid Daliri, Christopher Musco, Ananda Theertha Suresh</p>
<p>Abstract: Suppose Alice has a distribution $P$ and Bob has a distribution $Q$. Alice wants to draw a sample $a\sim P$ and Bob a sample $b \sim Q$ such that $a = b$ with as high of probability as possible. It is well-known that, by sampling from an optimal coupling between the distributions, Alice and Bob can achieve $\Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)$, where $D_{TV}(P,Q)$ is the total variation distance between $P$ and $Q$. What if Alice and Bob must solve this same problem \emph{without communicating at all?} Perhaps surprisingly, with access to public randomness, they can still achieve $\Pr[a = b] \geq \frac{1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1 + D_{TV}(P,Q)} \geq 1-2D_{TV}(P,Q)$ using a simple protocol based on the Weighted MinHash algorithm. This bound was shown to be optimal in the worst-case by [Bavarian et al., 2020]. In this work, we revisit the communication-free coupling problem. We provide a simpler proof of the optimality result from [Bavarian et al., 2020]. We show that, while the worst-case success probability of Weighted MinHash cannot be improved, an equally simple protocol based on Gumbel sampling offers a Pareto improvement: for every pair of distributions $P, Q$, Gumbel sampling achieves an equal or higher value of $\Pr[a = b]$ than Weighted MinHash. Importantly, this improvement translates to practice. We demonstrate an application of communication-free coupling to \emph{speculative decoding}, a recent method for accelerating autoregressive large language models [Leviathan, Kalman, Matias, ICML 2023]. We show that communication-free protocols can be used to contruct \emph{\CSD{}} schemes, which have the desirable property that their output is fixed given a fixed random seed, regardless of what drafter is used for speculation. In experiments on a language generation task, Gumbel sampling outperforms Weighted MinHash. Code is available at https://github.com/majid-daliri/DISD.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhananjay Ashok, Jonathan May</p>
<p>Abstract: Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems increasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows promise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is poorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact Verification (FV) and Question Answering (QA) by studying the effects of incrementally replacing human generated data with synthetic points on eight diverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be reliably improved by including as few as 125 human generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of just a little additional human data (only 200 points) requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data and estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our results suggest that even when human annotation at scale is infeasible, there is great value to having a small proportion of the dataset being human generated.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinwon Sohn, Qifan Song</p>
<p>Abstract: A generative adversarial network (GAN) has been a representative backbone model in generative artificial intelligence (AI) because of its powerful performance in capturing intricate data-generating processes. However, the GAN training is well-known for its notorious training instability, usually characterized by the occurrence of mode collapse. Through the lens of gradients' variance, this work particularly analyzes the training instability and inefficiency in the presence of mode collapse by linking it to multimodality in the target distribution. To ease the raised training issues from severe multimodality, we introduce a novel GAN training framework that leverages a series of tempered distributions produced via convex interpolation. With our newly developed GAN objective function, the generator can learn all the tempered distributions simultaneously, conceptually resonating with the parallel tempering in statistics. Our simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing popular training strategies in both image and tabular data synthesis. We theoretically analyze that such significant improvement can arise from reducing the variance of gradient estimates by using the tempered distributions. Finally, we further develop a variant of the proposed framework aimed at generating fair synthetic data which is one of the growing interests in the field of trustworthy AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bahri Batuhan Bilecen, Ahmet Berke Gokmen, Furkan Guzelant, Aysegul Dundar</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akiharu Esashi, Pawissanutt Lertpongrujikorn, Shinji Kato, Mohsen Amini Salehi</p>
<p>Abstract: Function as a Service (FaaS) is poised to become the foundation of the next generation of cloud systems due to its inherent advantages in scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. However, challenges such as the need for specialized knowledge, platform dependence, and difficulty in scalability in building functional workflows persist for cloud-native application developers. To overcome these challenges and mitigate the burden of developing FaaS-based applications, in this paper, we propose a mechanism called Action Engine, that makes use of tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) at its kernel to interpret human language queries and automates FaaS workflow generation, thereby, reducing the need for specialized expertise and manual design. Action Engine includes modules to identify relevant functions from the FaaS repository and seamlessly manage the data dependency between them, ensuring the developer's query is processed and resolved. Beyond that, Action Engine can execute the generated workflow by injecting the user-provided arguments. On another front, this work addresses a gap in tool-augmented LLM research via adopting an Automatic FaaS Workflow Generation perspective to systematically evaluate methodologies across four fundamental sub-processes. Through benchmarking various parameters, this research provides critical insights into streamlining workflow automation for real-world applications, specifically in the FaaS continuum. Our evaluations demonstrate that the Action Engine achieves comparable performance to the few-shot learning approach while maintaining platform- and language-agnosticism, thereby, mitigating provider-specific dependencies in workflow generation. We notice that Action Engine can unlock FaaS workflow generation for non-cloud-savvy developers and expedite the development cycles of cloud-native applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guizhe Jin, Zhuoren Li, Bo Leng, Wei Han, Lu Xiong, Chen Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy updating and policy execution. On the one hand, a single value evaluation network limits the policy updating in complex scenarios with coupled driving objectives. On the other hand, the common single-type action space structure limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, an advanced MORL architecture is constructed, in which the ensemble-critic focuses on different objectives through independent reward functions. The architecture integrates a hybrid parameterized action space structure, and the generated driving actions contain both abstract guidance that matches the hybrid road modality and concrete control commands. Additionally, an uncertainty-based exploration mechanism that supports hybrid actions is developed to learn multi-objective compatible policies more quickly. Experimental results demonstrate that, in both simulator-based and HighD dataset-based multi-lane highway scenarios, our method efficiently learns multi-objective compatible autonomous driving with respect to efficiency, action consistency, and safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuzhuo Li, Di Zhao, Tingrui Qiao, Yihao Wu, Bo Pang, Yun Sing Koh</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying individual animals within large wildlife populations is essential for effective wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts. Recent advancements in computer vision have shown promise in animal re-identification (Animal ReID) by leveraging data from camera traps. However, existing Animal ReID datasets rely exclusively on visual data, overlooking environmental metadata that ecologists have identified as highly correlated with animal behavior and identity, such as temperature and circadian rhythms. Moreover, the emergence of multimodal models capable of jointly processing visual and textual data presents new opportunities for Animal ReID, but existing datasets fail to leverage these models' text-processing capabilities, limiting their full potential. Additionally, to facilitate the use of metadata in existing ReID methods, we propose the Meta-Feature Adapter (MFA), a lightweight module that can be incorporated into existing vision-language model (VLM)-based Animal ReID methods, allowing ReID models to leverage both environmental metadata and visual information to improve ReID performance. Experiments on MetaWild show that combining baseline ReID models with MFA to incorporate metadata consistently improves performance compared to using visual information alone, validating the effectiveness of incorporating metadata in re-identification. We hope that our proposed dataset can inspire further exploration of multimodal approaches for Animal ReID.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fran\c{c}ois G. Meyer</p>
<p>Abstract: The notion of barycentre graph is of crucial importance for machine learning algorithms that process graph-valued data. The barycentre graph is a "summary graph" that captures the mean topology and connectivity structure of a training dataset of graphs. The construction of a barycentre requires the definition of a metric to quantify distances between pairs of graphs. In this work, we use a multiscale spectral distance that is defined using the eigenvalues of the normalized graph Laplacian. The eigenvalues -- but not the eigenvectors -- of the normalized Laplacian of the barycentre graph can be determined from the optimization problem that defines the barycentre. In this work, we propose a structural constraint on the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian of the barycentre graph that guarantees that the barycentre inherits the topological structure of the graphs in the sample dataset. The eigenvectors can be computed using an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases. When the graphs are random realizations of a balanced stochastic block model, then our algorithm returns a barycentre that converges asymptotically (in the limit of large graph size) almost-surely to the population mean of the graphs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator; we conduct experiments on real-life graphs that suggest that our approach works beyond the controlled environment of stochastic block models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zexin Cai, Henry Li Xinyuan, Ashi Garg, Leibny Paola Garc\'ia-Perera, Kevin Duh, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Matthew Wiesner, Nicholas Andrews</p>
<p>Abstract: Most current zero-shot voice conversion methods rely on externally supervised components, particularly speaker encoders, for training. To explore alternatives that eliminate this dependency, this paper introduces GenVC, a novel framework that disentangles speaker identity and linguistic content from speech signals in a self-supervised manner. GenVC leverages speech tokenizers and an autoregressive, Transformer-based language model as its backbone for speech generation. This design supports large-scale training while enhancing both source speaker privacy protection and target speaker cloning fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that GenVC achieves notably higher speaker similarity, with naturalness on par with leading zero-shot approaches. Moreover, due to its autoregressive formulation, GenVC introduces flexibility in temporal alignment, reducing the preservation of source prosody and speaker-specific traits, and making it highly effective for voice anonymization.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SW) when employed as an objective functional. The SW metric has gained significant interest in the optimal transport and machine learning literature, due to its ability to capture intricate geometric properties of probability distributions while remaining computationally tractable, making it a valuable tool for various applications, including generative modeling and domain adaptation. Our study aims to provide a rigorous analysis of the critical points arising from the optimization of the SW objective. By computing explicit perturbations, we establish that stable critical points of SW cannot concentrate on segments. This stability analysis is crucial for understanding the behaviour of optimization algorithms for models trained using the SW objective. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the SW objective, shedding light on the existence and convergence behavior of critical points. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya K Surikuchi, Raquel Fern\'andez, Sandro Pezzelle</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, a substantial body of work in visually grounded natural language processing has focused on real-life multimodal scenarios such as describing content depicted in images or videos. However, comparatively less attention has been devoted to study the nature and degree of interaction between the different modalities in these scenarios. In this paper, we argue that any task dealing with natural language generation from sequences of images or frames is an instance of the broader, more general problem of modeling the intricate relationships between visual events unfolding over time and the features of the language used to interpret, describe, or narrate them. Therefore, solving these tasks requires models to be capable of identifying and managing such intricacies. We consider five seemingly different tasks, which we argue are compelling instances of this broader multimodal problem. Subsequently, we survey the modeling and evaluation approaches adopted for these tasks in recent years and examine the common set of challenges these tasks pose. Building on this perspective, we identify key open questions and propose several research directions for future investigation.</p>

In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic linear solver over the parameter space. This leverages information from the solved linear systems in a regression setting to provide an efficient posterior mean and covariance. We advocate using this as companion regression model for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and discuss the favourable properties of the posterior mean and covariance as the initial guess and preconditioner. We also provide several design choices for this companion solver. Numerical experiments showcase the benefits of using our novel solver in a hyperparameter optimisation problem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steeve Cuthbert Marcelyn, Yucen Gao, Yuzhe Zhang, Xiaofeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Path recommendation (PR) aims to generate travel paths that are customized to a user's specific preferences and constraints. Conventional approaches often employ explicit optimization objectives or specialized machine learning architectures; however, these methods typically exhibit limited flexibility and generalizability, necessitating costly retraining to accommodate new scenarios. This paper introduces an alternative paradigm that conceptualizes PR as a natural language generation task. We present PathGPT, a retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) system that leverages historical trajectory data and natural language user constraints to generate plausible paths. The proposed methodology first converts raw trajectory data into a human-interpretable textual format, which is then stored in a database. Subsequently, a hybrid retrieval system extracts path-specific context from this database to inform a pretrained LLM. The primary contribution of this work is a novel framework that demonstrates how integrating established information retrieval and generative model components can enable adaptive, zero-shot path generation across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets indicate that PathGPT's performance is competitive with specialized, learning-based methods, underscoring its potential as a flexible and generalizable path generation system that avoids the need for retraining inherent in previous data-driven models.</p>

As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we outline a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we propose a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maris F. L. Galesloot, Roman Andriushchenko, Milan \v{C}e\v{s}ka, Sebastian Junges, Nils Jansen</p>
<p>Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model specific environments in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Critically, optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space. The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models, and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for each of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the HM-POMDP, and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and generalize better to unseen POMDPs, and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of over a hundred thousand environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rishikesh Srinivasan, Dheeraj Nagaraj</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in the literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biodiversity assessments are critically affected by the spatial scale at which species richness is measured. How species richness accumulates with sampling area depends on natural and anthropogenic processes whose effects can change depending on the spatial scale considered. These accumulation dynamics, described by the species-area relationship (SAR), are challenging to assess because most biodiversity surveys are restricted to sampling areas much smaller than the scales at which these processes operate. Here, we combine sampling theory and deep learning to predict local species richness within arbitrarily large sampling areas, enabling for the first time to estimate spatial differences in SARs. We demonstrate our approach by predicting vascular plant species richness across Europe and evaluate predictions against an independent dataset of plant community inventories. The resulting model, named deep SAR, delivers multi-scale species richness maps, improving coarse grain richness estimates by 32% compared to conventional methods, while delivering finer grain estimates. Additional to its predictive capabilities, we show how our deep SAR model can provide fundamental insights on the multi-scale effects of key biodiversity processes. The capacity of our approach to deliver comprehensive species richness estimates across the full spectrum of ecologically relevant scales is essential for robust biodiversity assessments and forecasts under global change.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Vinaya Sathyanarayana, Sharanabasava D. Hiremath, Rahil Shah, Rishikesh Panda, Rahul Jana, Riya Singh, Rida Irfan, Ashwin Murali, Bharath Ramsundar</p>
<p>Abstract: The synthesis of complex natural products remains one of the grand challenges of organic chemistry. We present DeepRetro, a major advancement in computational retrosynthesis that enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for complex molecules typically considered beyond the reach of existing retrosynthetic methods. DeepRetro is a novel, open-source framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs), traditional retrosynthetic engines, and expert human feedback in an iterative design loop. Prior approaches rely solely on template-based methods or unconstrained LLM outputs. In contrast, DeepRetro combines the precision of template-based methods with the generative flexibility of LLMs, controlled by rigorous chemical validity checks and enhanced by recursive refinement. This hybrid system dynamically explores and revises synthetic pathways, guided by both algorithmic checks and expert chemist feedback through an interactive user interface. While DeepRetro achieves strong performance on standard retrosynthesis benchmarks, its true strength lies in its ability to propose novel, viable pathways to highly complex natural products-targets that have historically eluded automated planning. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate how this approach enables new routes for total synthesis and facilitates human-machine collaboration in organic chemistry. Beyond retrosynthesis, DeepRetro represents a working model for how to leverage LLMs in scientific discovery. We provide a transparent account of the system's design, algorithms, and human-feedback loop, enabling broad adaptation across scientific domains. By releasing DeepRetro as an open-source tool, we aim to empower chemists to tackle increasingly ambitious synthetic targets, accelerating progress in drug discovery, materials design, and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sathvik Chereddy, John Femiani</p>
<p>Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation, facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL) from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hayeon Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving pose critical challenges, as planners often fail to generalize beyond their training experience, leading to unsafe or unexpected behavior. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in handling such scenarios by providing high-level scene understanding and user-aligned decisions. However, existing VLMs often exhibit a misalignment between their language-based reasoning and the low-level trajectories required for action-level planning. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to fine-tune VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that LaViPlan improves planning performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. While linguistic fidelity slightly decreases after RLVR-based fine-tuning, qualitative evaluation indicates that the outputs remain coherent. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the effects of sampling ratio and reasoning guidance, highlighting how these design choices influence performance. These findings demonstrate the potential of RLVR as a post-training paradigm for aligning language-guided reasoning with action-level planning in autonomous driving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suchisrit Gangopadhyay, Jung-Hee Kim, Xien Chen, Patrick Rim, Hyoungseob Park, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Younjoon Chung, Hyoungseob Park, Patrick Rim, Xiaoran Zhang, Jihe He, Ziyao Zeng, Safa Cicek, Byung-Woo Hong, James S. Duncan, Alex Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution (target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution. We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'', or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weitai Kang, Weiming Zhuang, Zhizhong Li, Yan Yan, Lingjuan Lyu</p>
<p>Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haiquan Hu, Jiazhi Jiang, Shiyou Xu, Ruhan Zeng, Tian Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples} (STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sneha Noble, Neelam Sinha, Vaanathi Sundareshan, Thomas Gregor Issac</p>
<p>Abstract: The influence of sex and age on cerebral perfusion is recognized, but the specific impacts on regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and vascular risk remain to be fully characterized. In this study, 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI was used to identify sex and age related CBF patterns, and a vascular risk score (VRS) was developed based on normative perfusion profiles. Perfusion data from 186 cognitively healthy participants (89 males, 97 females; aged 8 to 92 years), obtained from a publicly available dataset, were analyzed. An extension of the 3D Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) supervoxel algorithm was applied to CBF maps to group neighboring voxels with similar intensities into anatomically meaningful regions. Regional CBF features were extracted and used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for sex classification and perfusion pattern analysis. Global, age related CBF changes were also assessed. Participant specific VRS was computed by comparing individual CBF profiles to age and sex specific normative data to quantify perfusion deficits. A 95 percent accuracy in sex classification was achieved using the proposed supervoxel based method, and distinct perfusion signatures were identified. Higher CBF was observed in females in medial Brodmann areas 6 and 10, area V5, occipital polar cortex, and insular regions. A global decline in CBF with age was observed in both sexes. Individual perfusion deficits were quantified using VRS, providing a personalized biomarker for early hypoperfusion. Sex and age specific CBF patterns were identified, and a personalized vascular risk biomarker was proposed, contributing to advancements in precision neurology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicole Cho, Kirsty Fielding, William Watson, Sumitra Ganesh, Manuela Veloso</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diaa Addeen Abuhani, Marco Seccaroni, Martina Mazzarello, Imran Zualkernan, Fabio Duarte, Carlo Ratti</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.</p>
