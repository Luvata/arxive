<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyang Liu, Bianca Brie, Wenda Li, Laura Biester, Andrew Lee, James Pennebaker, Rada Mihalcea</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been previously explored for mental healthcare training and therapy client simulation, but they still fall short in authentically capturing diverse client traits and psychological conditions. We introduce \textbf{Eeyore}, an 8B model optimized for realistic depression simulation through a structured alignment framework, incorporating expert input at every stage. First, we systematically curate real-world depression-related conversations, extracting depressive traits to guide data filtering and psychological profile construction, and use this dataset to instruction-tune Eeyore for profile adherence. Next, to further enhance realism, Eeyore undergoes iterative preference optimization -- first leveraging model-generated preferences and then calibrating with a small set of expert-annotated preferences. Throughout the entire pipeline, we actively collaborate with domain experts, developing interactive interfaces to validate trait extraction and iteratively refine structured psychological profiles for clinically meaningful role-play customization. Despite its smaller model size, the Eeyore depression simulation outperforms GPT-4o with SOTA prompting strategies, both in linguistic authenticity and profile adherence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rakeen Rouf, Trupti Bavalatti, Osama Ahmed, Dhaval Potdar, Faraz Jawed</p>
<p>Abstract: Novel research aimed at text-to-image (T2I) generative AI safety often relies on publicly available datasets for training and evaluation, making the quality and composition of these datasets crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the key datasets used in the T2I research, detailing their collection methods, compositions, semantic and syntactic diversity of prompts and the quality, coverage, and distribution of harm types in the datasets. By highlighting the strengths and limitations of the datasets, this study enables researchers to find the most relevant datasets for a use case, critically assess the downstream impacts of their work given the dataset distribution, particularly regarding model safety and ethical considerations, and also identify the gaps in dataset coverage and quality that future research may address.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gopi Krishna Jha, Sameh Gobriel, Liubov Talamanova, Alexander Kozlov, Nilesh Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: Key-value (KV) caching has emerged as a crucial optimization technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs). By allowing the attention operation to scale linearly rather than quadratically with the total sequence length, KV caching significantly enhances generation throughput. However, due to large context lengths in the modern LLMs, the memory footprint of the KV is a huge bottleneck for model deployment directly impacting the model's batch size, hindering its ability to deliver high-throughput. Existing research addresses this challenge using several techniques, such as discarding low-attention tokens, quantization, and matrix approximation which typically lead to a negative impact on the model accuracy.
  In this paper, We propose KVCrush technology which can be combined with many KV compression technologies to improve the model accuracy at a much smaller memory. KVCrush provides an alternate representation scheme for key-value states, along with a low-overhead token pruning algorithm that accounts for the token distribution in the KV cache, which in turn allows for a a smaller footprint while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Based on our results, KVCrush reduces LongBench KV Cache size by 4x with less than 1% accuracy drop and achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy with minimal overhead, incurring less than 0.5% total inference latency. KVCrush not only outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art importance-based token retention schemes but is also compatible with typical practical LLM deployments using KV cache paging schemes such as vLLM and mixed precision quantization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanran Chen, Steffen Eger</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotions have been shown to play a role in argument convincingness, yet this aspect is underexplored in the natural language processing (NLP) community. Unlike prior studies that use static analyses, focus on a single text domain or language, or treat emotion as just one of many factors, we introduce a dynamic framework inspired by manipulation checks commonly used in psychology and social science; leveraging LLM-based manipulation checks, this framework examines the extent to which perceived emotional intensity influences perceived convincingness. Through human evaluation of arguments across different languages, text domains, and topics, we find that in over half of cases, judgments of convincingness remain unchanged despite variations in perceived emotional intensity; when emotions do have an impact, they more often enhance rather than weaken convincingness. We further analyze how 11 LLMs behave in the same scenario, finding that while LLMs generally mirror human patterns, they struggle to capture nuanced emotional effects in individual judgments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carlos Luengo Vera, Ignacio Ferro Picon, M. Teresa del Val Nunez, Jose Andres Gomez Gandia, Antonio de Lucas Ancillo, Victor Ramos Arroyo, Carlos Milan Figueredo</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of 22 large language models LLMs on the Spanish Medical Intern Resident MIR examinations for 2024 and 2025 with a focus on clinical reasoning domain specific expertise and multimodal processing capabilities The MIR exam consisting of 210 multiple choice questions some requiring image interpretation serves as a stringent benchmark for assessing both factual recall and complex clinical problem solving skills Our investigation encompasses general purpose models such as GPT4 Claude LLaMA and Gemini as well as specialized fine tuned systems like Miri Pro which leverages proprietary Spanish healthcare data to excel in medical contexts
  Recent market entries Deepseek and Grok have further enriched the evaluation landscape particularly for tasks that demand advanced visual and semantic analysis The findings indicate that while general purpose LLMs perform robustly overall fine tuned models consistently achieve superior accuracy especially in addressing nuanced domain specific challenges A modest performance decline observed between the two exam cycles appears attributable to the implementation of modified questions designed to mitigate reliance on memorization
  The results underscore the transformative potential of domain specific fine tuning and multimodal integration in advancing medical AI applications They also highlight critical implications for the future integration of LLMs into medical education training and clinical decision making emphasizing the importance of balancing automated reasoning with ethical and context aware judgment</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shinwoo Park, Shubin Kim, Do-Kyung Kim, Yo-Sub Han</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.
  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao-Xiang Xu, Jun-Yu Ma, Zhen-Hua Ling, Ningyu Zhang, Jia-Chen Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with hallucinations due to false or outdated knowledge. Given the high resource demands of retraining these models, there is an increasing focus on developing model editing. However, the general abilities of LLMs across downstream tasks are prone to significant degradation during sequential editing. This paper statistically observes that the parameter matrix after editing exhibits a significant deviation compared to its previous state as the number of edits increases. This serious deviation affects the original knowledge associations within LLMs and leads to the degradation of their general abilities. To this end, a framework termed Editing Anchor Compression (EAC) is proposed to constrain the deviation of the parameter matrix during sequential editing. It compresses the editing information by selecting editing anchors that are important in encoding new relations without deviating too much from the original matrix, thereby preserving the general abilities. Experiments of applying EAC to two popular editing methods on three LLMs across four tasks are conducted. Evaluation results show that EAC effectively minimizes unreasonable deviations caused by model editing, preserving over 70% of the general abilities while better retaining the editing knowledge compared to the original counterpart methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Zhao, Zhe Li, Yige Li, Jun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in multimodal comprehension, thanks to extensive pre-training and fine-tuning on large-scale visual datasets. However, despite their robust textual safety mechanisms, they remain vulnerable to harmful visual inputs. Existing safeguards-typically relying on pre-filtering or fine-tuning-incur high costs and diminish overall utility. To address this critical vulnerability, we introduce SafeCLIP, a lightweight method that leverages LVLMs inherent multimodal alignment for zero-shot toxic image detection. By projecting CLIPs discarded CLS token into its text space and matching it with toxic descriptors, SafeCLIP detects harmful content without any architectural changes-adding minimal latency and enabling dynamic safety corrections during inference and fine-tuning.Experiments show that SafeCLIP achieves a 66.9% defense success rate with only 3.2% false positive rate and 7.2% overhead. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods achieve 52.9% success but have a 10.7% false positive rate and 210% overhead. Our work demonstrates that leveraging inherent multimodal alignment can yield efficient, low-cost LVLM safety. Code is available at anonymous.4open.science/r/safeclip-2C01.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zenghao Duan, Teli Liu, Min Liu, Zhiyi Yin, Qi Li, Jiangyu Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: Current studies have exposed the risk of Large Language Models (LLMs) generating harmful content by jailbreak attacks. However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nikita Soni, Pranav Chitale, Khushboo Singh, Niranjan Balasubramanian, H. Andrew Schwartz</p>
<p>Abstract: Like most of NLP, models for human-centered NLP tasks -- tasks attempting to assess author-level information -- predominantly use representations derived from hidden states of Transformer-based LLMs. However, what component of the LM is used for the representation varies widely. Moreover, there is a need for Human Language Models (HuLMs) that implicitly model the author and provide a user-level hidden state. Here, we systematically evaluate different ways of representing documents and users using different LM and HuLM architectures to predict task outcomes as both dynamically changing states and averaged trait-like user-level attributes of valence, arousal, empathy, and distress. We find that representing documents as an average of the token hidden states performs the best generally. Further, while a user-level hidden state itself is rarely the best representation, we find its inclusion in the model strengthens token or document embeddings used to derive document- and user-level representations resulting in best performances.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Magnus Sesodia, Alina Petrova, John Armour, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Oana-Maria Camburu, Puneet K. Dokania, Philip Torr, Christian Schroeder de Witt</p>
<p>Abstract: Legal systems worldwide continue to struggle with overwhelming caseloads, limited judicial resources, and growing complexities in legal proceedings. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution, with Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) -- the practice of predicting a court's decision from the case facts -- emerging as a key research area. However, existing datasets often formulate the task of LJP unrealistically, not reflecting its true difficulty. They also lack high-quality annotation essential for legal reasoning and explainability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce AnnoCaseLaw, a first-of-its-kind dataset of 471 meticulously annotated U.S. Appeals Court negligence cases. Each case is enriched with comprehensive, expert-labeled annotations that highlight key components of judicial decision making, along with relevant legal concepts. Our dataset lays the groundwork for more human-aligned, explainable LJP models. We define three legally relevant tasks: (1) judgment prediction; (2) concept identification; and (3) automated case annotation, and establish a performance baseline using industry-leading large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate that LJP remains a formidable task, with application of legal precedent proving particularly difficult.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00134">Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning for LLMs: A Case Study on Dietary Recommendations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhongqi Yang, Amir Rahmani</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively leverage common-sense knowledge for general reasoning, yet they struggle with personalized reasoning when tasked with interpreting multifactor personal data. This limitation restricts their applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization in the reasoning process.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grigor Nalbandyan, Rima Shahbazyan, Evelina Bakhturina</p>
<p>Abstract: Typical evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) report a single metric per dataset, often representing the model's best-case performance under carefully selected settings. Unfortunately, this approach overlooks model robustness and reliability in real-world applications. For instance, simple paraphrasing of prompts on the MMLU-Pro dataset causes accuracy fluctuations of up to 10\%, while reordering answer choices in the AGIEval dataset results in accuracy differences of up to 6.1\%. While some studies discuss issues with LLM robustness, there is no unified or centralized framework for evaluating the robustness of language models. To address this gap and consolidate existing research on model robustness, we present SCORE ($\mathbf{S}$ystematic $\mathbf{CO}$nsistency and $\mathbf{R}$obustness $\mathbf{E}$valuation), a comprehensive framework for non-adversarial evaluation of LLMs. The SCORE framework evaluates models by repeatedly testing them on the same benchmarks in various setups to give a realistic estimate of their accuracy and consistency. We release the code publicly and start an LLM robustness leaderboard to facilitate further development and research.</p>

<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, ensuring their cultural sensitivity and inclusivity is paramount. We introduce our dataset, a year-long community-driven project covering all 22 Arab countries. The dataset includes instructions (input, response pairs) in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA), spanning 20 diverse topics. Built by a team of 44 researchers across the Arab world, all of whom are authors of this paper, our dataset offers a broad, inclusive perspective. We use our dataset to evaluate the cultural and dialectal capabilities of several frontier LLMs, revealing notable limitations. For instance, while closed-source LLMs generally exhibit strong performance, they are not without flaws, and smaller open-source models face greater challenges. Moreover, certain countries (e.g., Egypt, the UAE) appear better represented than others (e.g., Iraq, Mauritania, Yemen). Our annotation guidelines, code, and data for reproducibility are publicly available.</p>

Uncertainty estimation is the key method to address this challenge. While research efforts in uncertainty estimation are ramping up, there is a lack of comprehensive and dedicated surveys on LLM uncertainty estimation. This survey presents four major avenues of LLM uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we perform extensive experimental evaluations across multiple methods and datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> William Nguyen, An Phan, Konobu Kimura, Hitoshi Maeno, Mika Tanaka, Quynh Le, William Poucher, Christopher Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential in addressing complex reasoning tasks, yet their general-purpose nature often limits their effectiveness in specialized domains such as maritime navigation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Llamarine, the first open-source LLM designed specifically for maritime navigation. Llamarine 1.0 is developed through continued pretraining and fine-tuning on a high-quality corpus comprising maritime textbooks, research publications, and web text from Wikipedia. This domain-specific training enables the model to acquire expert-level knowledge in navigational principles, collision avoidance, route optimization, and regulatory compliance. Our key contributions include (a) the curation of a comprehensive maritime dataset from authoritative sources, ensuring depth and reliability in the model's knowledge base; (b) the development of a foundational model capable of reasoning about complex navigational challenges with greater accuracy than general-purpose LLMs; and (c) the establishment of a benchmark to evaluate performance in maritime-specific decision-making tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Llamarine outperforms both general-purpose and commercial LLMs in critical navigation-related tasks, such as trajectory planning, risk assessment, and compliance with maritime regulations. By providing an open-source foundation model trained exclusively on high-quality maritime literature, Llamarine paves the way for AI-driven advancements in maritime safety, efficiency, and operational decision-making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vu Minh Hoang Dang, Rakesh M. Verma</p>
<p>Abstract: Linguistic richness is essential for advancing natural language processing (NLP), as dataset characteristics often directly influence model performance. However, traditional metrics such as Type-Token Ratio (TTR), Vocabulary Diversity (VOCD), and Measure of Lexical Text Diversity (MTLD) do not adequately capture contextual relationships, semantic richness, and structural complexity. In this paper, we introduce an autoencoder-based framework that uses neural network capacity as a proxy for vocabulary richness, diversity, and complexity, enabling a dynamic assessment of the interplay between vocabulary size, sentence structure, and contextual depth. We validate our approach on two distinct datasets: the DIFrauD dataset, which spans multiple domains of deceptive and fraudulent text, and the Project Gutenberg dataset, representing diverse languages, genres, and historical periods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> K. O. T. Erziev</p>
<p>Abstract: We report a peculiar observation that LLMs can assign hidden meanings to sequences that seem visually incomprehensible to humans: for example, a nonsensical phrase consisting of Byzantine musical symbols is recognized by gpt-4o as "say abracadabra". Moreover, some models can communicate using these sequences.
  Some of these meanings are hypothesized to partly originate in the massive spurious correlations due to BPE tokenization. We systematically evaluate the presence of such abilities in a wide range of models: Claude-3.5 Haiku, Claude-3.5 Sonnet (New and Old), Claude-3.7 Sonnet, gpt-4o mini, gpt-4o, o1-mini, Llama-3.3 70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Lllama 70B, Qwen2.5 1.5B, Qwen2.5 32B, Phi-3.5 mini, GigaChat-Max, Vikhr-Llama-3.2 1B.
  We argue that this observation might have far-reaching consequences for both safety and security of the modern and future LLMs and systems that employ them. As an illustration, we show that applying this method in combination with simple templates is sufficient to jailbreak previous generation models, with ASR = 0.4 on gpt-4o mini.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samar M. Magdy, Sang Yun Kwon, Fakhraddin Alwajih, Safaa Abdelfadil, Shady Shehata, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction fine-tuning, alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and optimization techniques like direct preference optimization (DPO) have significantly enhanced the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) to user preferences. However, despite these innovations, many LLMs continue to exhibit biases toward Western, Anglo-centric, or American cultures, with performance on English data consistently surpassing that of other languages. This reveals a persistent cultural gap in LLMs, which complicates their ability to accurately process culturally rich and diverse figurative language such as proverbs. To address this, we introduce Jawaher, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs' capacity to comprehend and interpret Arabic proverbs. Jawaher includes proverbs from various Arabic dialects, along with idiomatic translations and explanations. Through extensive evaluations of both open- and closed-source models, we find that while LLMs can generate idiomatically accurate translations, they struggle with producing culturally nuanced and contextually relevant explanations. These findings highlight the need for ongoing model refinement and dataset expansion to bridge the cultural gap in figurative language processing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangsheng Bao, Lihua Rong, Yanbin Zhao, Qiji Zhou, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The wide usage of LLMs raises critical requirements on detecting AI participation in texts. Existing studies investigate these detections in scattered contexts, leaving a systematic and unified approach unexplored. In this paper, we present HART, a hierarchical framework of AI risk levels, each corresponding to a detection task. To address these tasks, we propose a novel 2D Detection Method, decoupling a text into content and language expression. Our findings show that content is resistant to surface-level changes, which can serve as a key feature for detection. Experiments demonstrate that 2D method significantly outperforms existing detectors, achieving an AUROC improvement from 0.705 to 0.849 for level-2 detection and from 0.807 to 0.886 for RAID.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raghav Gupta, Ryan Sullivan, Yunxuan Li, Samrat Phatale, Abhinav Rastogi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-objective preference alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for developing AI systems that are more configurable, personalizable, helpful, and safe. However, optimizing model outputs to satisfy diverse objectives with variable weights at inference time for truly personalized models presents a significant challenge. Existing approaches are either computationally expensive to train or do not sufficiently steer model behaviors. This paper introduces the Multi-Objective Online DPO (MO-ODPO) algorithm, designed to robustly and efficiently align model behaviors with multiple, potentially conflicting human preferences. Our approach incorporates a prompt conditioning mechanism, allowing us to train a single preference-conditional policy, that can adapt to new preference combinations at inference. Experiments on two popular benchmarks show that MO-ODPO Pareto-dominates existing baselines while providing excellent inference-time steerability between diverse objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianci Liu, Ruirui Li, Yunzhe Qi, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Tianqi Zheng, Qingyu Yin, Monica Xiao Cheng, Jun Huan, Haoyu Wang, Jing Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language tasks. However, they are trained on static corpora and their knowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This motivates the development of knowledge editing methods designed to update certain knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others. To make selective edits, previous efforts often sought to update a small amount of parameters in some specific layer(s) of a LLM. Nonetheless, in challenging scenarios, they still fall short in making successful edits while preserving knowledge irrelevant to the updates simultaneously, resulting in a notable editing-locality trade-off. In this work, we question if the trade-offs are caused by the fact that parameter-based updates have a global effect, i.e., edited parameters affect all inputs indiscriminately. In light of this, we explore the feasibility of representation fine-tuning, which applied some linear update to a few representations in a learned subspace, for knowledge editing. While being effective to enhance an LLM's general ability as demonstrated in the previous work, we theoretically show that this linear update imposes a tension in editing-locality trade-off. Subsequently, BaFT is proposed to break the linearity. BaFT computes a weight for each basis that spans a dimension of the subspace based on the input representation. This input-dependent weighting mechanism allows BaFT to manage different types of knowledge in an adaptive way, thereby achieving a better editing-locality trade-off. Experiments on three LLMs with five editing benchmarks in diverse scenarios show the superiority of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yao Yao, Yifei Yang, Xinbei Ma, Dongjie Yang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: How human cognitive abilities are formed has long captivated researchers. However, a significant challenge lies in developing meaningful methods to measure these complex processes. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), which now rival human capabilities in various domains, we are presented with a unique testbed to investigate human cognition through a new lens. Among the many facets of cognition, one particularly crucial aspect is the concept of semantic size, the perceived magnitude of both abstract and concrete words or concepts. This study seeks to investigate whether LLMs exhibit similar tendencies in understanding semantic size, thereby providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of human cognition. We begin by exploring metaphorical reasoning, comparing how LLMs and humans associate abstract words with concrete objects of varying sizes. Next, we examine LLMs' internal representations to evaluate their alignment with human cognitive processes. Our findings reveal that multi-modal training is crucial for LLMs to achieve more human-like understanding, suggesting that real-world, multi-modal experiences are similarly vital for human cognitive development. Lastly, we examine whether LLMs are influenced by attention-grabbing headlines with larger semantic sizes in a real-world web shopping scenario. The results show that multi-modal LLMs are more emotionally engaged in decision-making, but this also introduces potential biases, such as the risk of manipulation through clickbait headlines. Ultimately, this study offers a novel perspective on how LLMs interpret and internalize language, from the smallest concrete objects to the most profound abstract concepts like love. The insights gained not only improve our understanding of LLMs but also provide new avenues for exploring the cognitive abilities that define human intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jennifer Mickel, Maria De-Arteaga, Leqi Liu, Kevin Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: To recognize and mitigate the harms of generative AI systems, it is crucial to consider who is represented in the outputs of generative AI systems and how people are represented. A critical gap emerges when naively improving who is represented, as this does not imply bias mitigation efforts have been applied to address how people are represented. We critically examined this by investigating gender representation in occupation across state-of-the-art large language models. We first show evidence suggesting that over time there have been interventions to models altering the resulting gender distribution, and we find that women are more represented than men when models are prompted to generate biographies or personas. We then demonstrate that representational biases persist in how different genders are represented by examining statistically significant word differences across genders. This results in a proliferation of representational harms, stereotypes, and neoliberalism ideals that, despite existing interventions to increase female representation, reinforce existing systems of oppression.</p>

<p>Abstract: Detecting and classifying cyberbullying in social media is hard because of the complex nature of online language and the changing nature of content. This study presents a multi-stage BERT fusion framework. It uses hierarchical embeddings, dual attention mechanisms, and extra features to improve detection of cyberbullying content. The framework combines BERT embeddings with features like sentiment and topic information. It uses self-attention and cross-attention to align features and has a hierarchical classification head for multi-category classification. A dynamic loss balancing strategy helps optimize learning and improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These results show the model's strong performance and potential for broader use in analyzing social media content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunfan Gao, Yun Xiong, Wenlong Wu, Zijing Huang, Bohan Li, Haofen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their context windows to unprecedented lengths, sparking debates about the necessity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To address the fragmented evaluation paradigms and limited cases in existing Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), this paper introduces U-NIAH, a unified framework that systematically compares LLMs and RAG methods in controlled long context settings. Our framework extends beyond traditional NIAH by incorporating multi-needle, long-needle, and needle-in-needle configurations, along with different retrieval settings, while leveraging the synthetic Starlight Academy dataset-a fictional magical universe-to eliminate biases from pre-trained knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we investigate three research questions: (1) performance trade-offs between LLMs and RAG, (2) error patterns in RAG, and (3) RAG's limitations in complex settings. Our findings show that RAG significantly enhances smaller LLMs by mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" effect and improving robustness, achieving an 82.58% win-rate over LLMs. However, we observe that retrieval noise and reverse chunk ordering degrade performance, while surprisingly, advanced reasoning LLMs exhibit reduced RAG compatibility due to sensitivity to semantic distractors. We identify typical error patterns including omission due to noise, hallucination under high noise critical condition, and self-doubt behaviors. Our work not only highlights the complementary roles of RAG and LLMs, but also provides actionable insights for optimizing deployments. Code: https://github.com/Tongji-KGLLM/U-NIAH.</p>

<p>Abstract: From disinformation spread by AI chatbots to AI recommendations that inadvertently reinforce stereotypes, textual bias poses a significant challenge to the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework that systematically identifies biases by disentangling each statement as fact or opinion, assigning a bias intensity score, and providing concise, factual justifications. Evaluated on 1,500 samples from the WikiNPOV dataset, the framework achieves 84.9% accuracy$\unicode{x2014}$an improvement of 13.0% over the zero-shot baseline$\unicode{x2014}$demonstrating the efficacy of explicitly modeling fact versus opinion prior to quantifying bias intensity. By combining enhanced detection accuracy with interpretable explanations, this approach sets a foundation for promoting fairness and accountability in modern language models.</p>

This paper introduces an approach to address the challenges of Fact Verification using the Vietnamese dataset by integrating both sentence selection and classification modules into a unified network architecture. The proposed approach leverages the power of large language models by utilizing pre-trained PhoBERT and XLM-RoBERTa as the backbone of the network. The proposed model was trained on a Vietnamese dataset, named ISE-DSC01, and demonstrated superior performance compared to the baseline model across all three metrics. Notably, we achieved a Strict Accuracy level of 75.11\%, indicating a remarkable 28.83\% improvement over the baseline model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David James Woo, Hengky Susanto, Chi Ho Yeung, Kai Guo, Yilin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are reshaping how English as a foreign language (EFL) students write since students can compose texts by integrating their own words with AI-generated text. This study investigated how 59 Hong Kong secondary school students with varying levels of academic achievement interacted with AI-generated text to compose a feature article, exploring whether any interaction patterns benefited the overall quality of the article. Through content analysis, multiple linear regression and cluster analysis, we found the overall number of words -- whether AI- or human-generated -- is the main predictor of writing quality. However, the impact varies by students' competence to write independently, for instance, by using their own words accurately and coherently to compose a text, and to follow specific interaction patterns with AI-generated text. Therefore, although composing texts with human words and AI-generated text may become prevalent in EFL writing classrooms, without educators' careful attention to EFL writing pedagogy and AI literacy, high-achieving students stand to benefit more from using AI-generated text than low-achieving students.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zongru Wu, Pengzhou Cheng, Zheng Wu, Tianjie Ju, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Perception-enhanced pre-training, particularly through grounding techniques, is widely adopted to enhance the performance of graphical user interface (GUI) agents. However, in resource-constrained scenarios, the format discrepancy between coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning limits the effectiveness of grounding for reasoning tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a query-oriented pivot approach called query inference, which serves as a bridge between GUI grounding and reasoning. By inferring potential user queries from a screenshot and its associated element coordinates, query inference improves the understanding of coordinates while aligning more closely with reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that query inference outperforms previous grounding techniques under the same training data scale. Notably, query inference achieves comparable or even better performance to large-scale grounding-enhanced OS-Atlas with less than 0.1% of training data. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reasoning formats and demonstrate that integrating additional semantic information into the input further boosts reasoning performance.

As the world's third-largest democracy, Indonesia faces growing concerns about the interplay between political polarization and online toxicity, which is often directed at vulnerable minority groups. Despite the importance of this issue, previous NLP research has not fully explored the relationship between toxicity and polarization. To bridge this gap, we present a novel multi-label Indonesian dataset that incorporates toxicity, polarization, and annotator demographic information. Benchmarking this dataset using BERT-base models and large language models (LLMs) shows that polarization information enhances toxicity classification, and vice versa. Furthermore, providing demographic information significantly improves the performance of polarization classification.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on metaphor has steadily increased over the last decades, as this phenomenon opens a window into a range of processes in language and cognition, from pragmatic inference to abstraction and embodied simulation. At the same time, the demand for rigorously constructed and extensively normed experimental materials increased as well. Here, we present the Figurative Archive, an open database of 997 metaphors in Italian enriched with rating and corpus-based measures (from familiarity to lexical frequency), derived by collecting stimuli used across 11 studies. It includes both everyday and literary metaphors, varying in structure and semantic domains. Dataset validation comprised correlations between familiarity and other measures. The Figurative Archive has several aspects of novelty: it is increased in size compared to previous resources; it includes a novel measure of inclusiveness, to comply with current recommendations for non-discriminatory language use; it is displayed in a web-based interface, with features for a flexible and customized consultation. We provide guidelines for using the Archive in future metaphor studies, in the spirit of open science.</p>

<p>Abstract: Personalized opinion summarization is crucial as it considers individual user interests while generating product summaries. Recent studies show that although large language models demonstrate powerful text summarization and evaluation capabilities without the need for training data, they face difficulties in personalized tasks involving long texts. To address this, \textbf{Rehearsal}, a personalized opinion summarization framework via LLMs-based role-playing is proposed. Having the model act as the user, the model can better understand the user's personalized needs. Additionally, a role-playing supervisor and practice process are introduced to improve the role-playing ability of the LLMs, leading to a better expression of user needs. Furthermore, through suggestions from virtual users, the summary generation is intervened, ensuring that the generated summary includes information of interest to the user, thus achieving personalized summary generation. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the level of personalization in large model-generated summaries.</p>

While many studies have been carried out to test the power of computational methods for language subgrouping or divergence time estimation, few studies have put the data upon which these studies are based to a rigorous test. Here, we conduct a first experiment that tests the robustness of concept translation as an integral part of the compilation of multilingual wordlists. Investigating the variation in concept translations in independently compiled wordlists from 10 dataset pairs covering 9 different language families, we find that on average, only 83% of all translations yield the same word form, while identical forms in terms of phonetic transcriptions can only be found in 23% of all cases. Our findings can prove important when trying to assess the uncertainty of phylogenetic studies and the conclusions derived from them.</p>

We also share a new dataset established through obtaining both human and LLM annotations. Results show that the multi-perspective approach yields better classification performance (higher F1-scores), outperforming the traditional approaches that use a single ground-truth, while displaying lower model confidence scores, probably due to the high level of subjectivity of the stance detection task.</p>

<p>Abstract: This tutorial presents a comprehensive introduction to Speculative Decoding (SD), an advanced technique for LLM inference acceleration that has garnered significant research interest in recent years. SD is introduced as an innovative decoding paradigm to mitigate the high inference latency stemming from autoregressive decoding in LLMs. At each decoding step, SD efficiently drafts several future tokens and then verifies them in parallel. This approach, unlike traditional autoregressive decoding, facilitates the simultaneous decoding of multiple tokens per step, thereby achieving promising 2x-4x speedups in LLM inference while maintaining original distributions. This tutorial delves into the latest techniques in SD, including draft model architectures and verification strategies. Additionally, it explores the acceleration potential and future research directions in this promising field. We aim for this tutorial to elucidate the current research landscape and offer insights for researchers interested in Speculative Decoding, ultimately contributing to more efficient LLM inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tool-Augmented Language Models (TALMs) leverage external APIs to answer user queries across various domains. However, existing benchmark datasets for TALM research often feature simplistic dialogues that do not reflect real-world scenarios, such as the need for models to ask clarifying questions or proactively call additional APIs when essential information is missing. To address these limitations, we construct and release ToolDial, a dataset comprising 11,111 multi-turn dialogues, with an average of 8.95 turns per dialogue, based on APIs from RapidAPI. ToolDial has two key characteristics. First, the dialogues incorporate 16 user and system actions (e.g., "Request", "Clarify", "Fail inform") to capture the rich dynamics of real-world interactions. Second, we simulate dialogues where the system requests necessary information from the user based on API documentation and seeks additional APIs if the user fails to provide the required information. To facilitate this process, we introduce a method for generating an API graph that represents input and output compatibility between APIs. Using ToolDial, we evaluate a suite of language models on their ability to predict correct actions and extract input parameter values for API calls from the dialogue history. Modern language models achieve accuracy scores below 70%, indicating substantial room for improvement. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/holi-lab/ToolDial.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiancheng Zhao, Xingda Yu, Yuxiang Zhang, Zhen Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, pretrained large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, full-parameter fine-tuning methods require adjusting all model parameters, leading to immense computational resource demands. Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA have significantly reduced the number of parameters, they still face challenges such as gradient vanishing and the potential for further parameter reduction. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called LoR2C (Low-Rank Residual Connection Adaptation). LoR2C introduces residual connections with low-rank matrices within the model layers, which not only reduces the number of fine-tuning parameters but also effectively alleviates the gradient vanishing problem. Additionally, this paper presents three optimization variants of LoR2C: ShareLoR2C, MergeLoR2C, and InjectLoR2C. These variants further improve parameter efficiency and model performance through parameter sharing, module merging, and injection mechanisms, respectively. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks demonstrate that LoR2C and its optimized variants significantly reduce parameter overhead while maintaining or even improving performance, outperforming existing mainstream parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Oblivioniss/LoR2C.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Terry Tong, Fei Wang, Zhe Zhao, Muhao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel backdoor threat attacking the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation regime, where the adversary controls both the candidate and evaluator model. The backdoored evaluator victimizes benign users by unfairly assigning inflated scores to adversary. A trivial single token backdoor poisoning 1% of the evaluator training data triples the adversary's score with respect to their legitimate score. We systematically categorize levels of data access corresponding to three real-world settings, (1) web poisoning, (2) malicious annotator, and (3) weight poisoning. These regimes reflect a weak to strong escalation of data access that highly correlates with attack severity. Under the weakest assumptions - web poisoning (1), the adversary still induces a 20% score inflation. Likewise, in the (3) weight poisoning regime, the stronger assumptions enable the adversary to inflate their scores from 1.5/5 to 4.9/5. The backdoor threat generalizes across different evaluator architectures, trigger designs, evaluation tasks, and poisoning rates. By poisoning 10% of the evaluator training data, we control toxicity judges (Guardrails) to misclassify toxic prompts as non-toxic 89% of the time, and document reranker judges in RAG to rank the poisoned document first 97% of the time. LLM-as-a-Judge is uniquely positioned at the intersection of ethics and technology, where social implications of mislead model selection and evaluation constrain the available defensive tools. Amidst these challenges, model merging emerges as a principled tool to offset the backdoor, reducing ASR to near 0% whilst maintaining SOTA performance. Model merging's low computational cost and convenient integration into the current LLM Judge training pipeline position it as a promising avenue for backdoor mitigation in the LLM-as-a-Judge setting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayanth Mohan, Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Tomas Malik, Cornelia Caragea</p>
<p>Abstract: Keyphrases are the essential topical phrases that summarize a document. Keyphrase generation is a long-standing NLP task for automatically generating keyphrases for a given document. While the task has been comprehensively explored in the past via various models, only a few works perform some preliminary analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task. Given the impact of LLMs in the field of NLP, it is important to conduct a more thorough examination of their potential for keyphrase generation. In this paper, we attempt to meet this demand with our research agenda. Specifically, we focus on the zero-shot capabilities of open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Phi-3, Llama-3) and the closed-source GPT-4o for this task. We systematically investigate the effect of providing task-relevant specialized instructions in the prompt. Moreover, we design task-specific counterparts to self-consistency-style strategies for LLMs and show significant benefits from our proposals over the baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaifu Zhan, Shuang Zhou, Huixue Zhou, Jiawen Deng, Yu Hou, Jeremy Yeung, Rui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP), enhancing tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction, and text classification. In this context, the DeepSeek series of models have shown promising potential in general NLP tasks, yet their capabilities in the biomedical domain remain underexplored. This study evaluates multiple DeepSeek models (Distilled-DeepSeek-R1 series and Deepseek-LLMs) across four key biomedical NLP tasks using 12 datasets, benchmarking them against state-of-the-art alternatives (Llama3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, Phi-4-14B, Gemma-2-9B). Our results reveal that while DeepSeek models perform competitively in named entity recognition and text classification, challenges persist in event and relation extraction due to precision-recall trade-offs. We provide task-specific model recommendations and highlight future research directions. This evaluation underscores the strengths and limitations of DeepSeek models in biomedical NLP, guiding their future deployment and optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Huang, Jingyuan Yi, Peiyang Yu, Xiaochuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation on social media has raised significant societal concerns, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2 have been envisioned as possible tools for detecting misinformation based on their advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper conducts a comparison of LLM-based approaches to detecting misinformation between text-based, multimodal, and agentic approaches. We evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuned models, zero-shot learning, and systematic fact-checking mechanisms in detecting misinformation across different topic domains like public health, politics, and finance. We also discuss scalability, generalizability, and explainability of the models and recognize key challenges such as hallucination, adversarial attacks on misinformation, and computational resources. Our findings point towards the importance of hybrid approaches that pair structured verification protocols with adaptive learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and explainability. The paper closes by suggesting potential avenues of future work, including real-time tracking of misinformation, federated learning, and cross-platform detection models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongchao Gu, Dexun Li, Kuicai Dong, Hao Zhang, Hang Lv, Hao Wang, Defu Lian, Yong Liu, Enhong Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating knowledge-intensive and comprehensive long texts, such as encyclopedia articles, remains significant challenges for Large Language Models. It requires not only the precise integration of facts but also the maintenance of thematic coherence throughout the article. Existing methods, such as direct generation and multi-agent discussion, often struggle with issues like hallucinations, topic incoherence, and significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose RAPID, an efficient retrieval-augmented long text generation framework. RAPID consists of three main modules: (1) Retrieval-augmented preliminary outline generation to reduce hallucinations, (2) Attribute-constrained search for efficient information discovery, (3) Plan-guided article generation for enhanced coherence. Extensive experiments on our newly compiled benchmark dataset, FreshWiki-2024, demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of evaluation metrics (e.g. long-text generation, outline quality, latency, etc). Our work provides a robust and efficient solution to the challenges of automated long-text generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yupu Hao, Pengfei Cao, Zhuoran Jin, Huanxuan Liao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized tool utilization is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preference in interaction scenarios with various tools. However, most of the current benchmarks primarily focus on either personalization of text generation or direct tool-utilizing, without considering both. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark ETAPP for evaluating personalized tool invocation, establishing a sandbox environment, and a comprehensive dataset of 800 testing cases covering diverse user profiles. To improve the accuracy of our evaluation, we propose a key-point-based LLM evaluation method, mitigating biases in the LLM-as-a-judge system by manually annotating key points for each test case and providing them to LLM as the reference. Additionally, we evaluate the excellent LLMs and provide an in-depth analysis. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different tool-invoking strategies on LLMs' personalization performance and the effects of fine-tuning in our task. The effectiveness of our preference-setting and key-point-based evaluation method is also validated. Our findings offer insights into improving personalized LLM agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Lv, Honglin Guo, Qipeng Guo, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks; however, their token-by-token autoregressive generation process significantly hinders inference speed. Speculative decoding presents a promising draft-then-verify framework that reduces generation latency while maintaining output distribution fidelity. Nevertheless, the draft model introduces additional computational overhead, becoming a performance bottleneck and increasing the time to first token (TTFT). Previous approaches to mitigate draft model overhead have primarily relied on heuristics and generally failed to match the quality of the draft language models. To address these challenges, we propose DuoDecoding, a novel approach that strategically deploys the draft and target models on the CPU and GPU respectively, enabling parallel decoding while preserving draft quality. Our method incorporates a hardware-aware optimal draft budget to minimize idle times and employs dynamic multi-sequence drafting to enhance draft quality. Extensive experiments across seven tasks show that DuoDecoding achieves up to 2.61x speedup in generation latency, while reducing TTFT to 83% of that in conventional speculative decoding.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kashun Shum, Yuzhen Huang, Hongjian Zou, Ding Qi, Yixuan Liao, Xiaoxin Chen, Qian Liu, Junxian He</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model pretraining involves training on extensive corpora, where data quality plays a pivotal role. In this work, we aim to directly estimate the contribution of data during pretraining and select pretraining data in an efficient manner. Specifically, we draw inspiration from recent findings showing that compression efficiency (i.e., the normalized loss) of diverse models on certain text correlates strongly with their downstream performance, when the text domain aligns with the downstream benchmark (Huang et al., 2024). Building on this observation, we hypothesize that data on which model losses are predictive of downstream abilities also contribute effectively to learning. To leverage this insight, we introduce data selection based on data's Predictive strength (Preselect), a lightweight and efficient data selection method that requires training and deploying only a fastText-based scorer. Through comprehensive experiments with 1B and 3B parameter models, we demonstrate that models trained on 30B tokens selected with PreSelect surpasses the performance of a vanilla baseline trained on 300B tokens, achieving a 10x reduction in compute requirements. Furthermore, PreSelect significantly outperforms other competitive data selection baselines, such as DCLM and FineWeb-Edu on a scale of 3B models trained on 100B tokens. We open-source our trained data selection scorer along with the curated datasets at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/PreSelect.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Damien de Mijolla, Hannan Saddiq, Kim Moore</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistency in the output of language models is critical for their reliability and practical utility. Due to their training objective, language models learn to model the full space of possible continuations, leading to outputs that can vary significantly in style and content, even for similar or repeated inputs. To address this, we propose a novel decoding algorithm that enhances response consistency across different prompts with no degradation in response quality. By incorporating a latent variable into the next-token sampling process based on the Gumbel reparametrisation trick, our method outperforms standard sampling by up to 10% across semantic and stylistic consistency benchmarks. Additionally, our approach integrates seamlessly with existing sampling methods with negligible computational overhead, providing a practical solution for improving the reliability of language model outputs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Miao Peng, Nuo Chen, Zongrui Suo, Jia Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), developing advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs remains a key challenge. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated exceptional promise in enhancing reasoning by providing step-wise feedback, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning. However, their application to broader reasoning domains remains understudied, largely due to the high costs associated with manually creating step-level supervision. In this work, we explore the potential of PRMs in graph reasoning problems - a domain that demands sophisticated multi-step reasoning and offers opportunities for automated step-level data generation using established graph algorithms. We introduce GraphSILO, the largest dataset for graph reasoning problems with fine-grained step-wise labels, built using automated Task-oriented Trajectories and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate detailed reasoning steps with step-wise labels. Building upon this dataset, we train GraphPRM, the first PRM designed for graph reasoning problems, and evaluate its effectiveness in two key settings: inference-time scaling and reinforcement learning via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that GraphPRM significantly improves LLM performance across 13 graph reasoning tasks, delivering a 9% gain for Qwen2.5-7B and demonstrating transferability to new graph reasoning datasets and new reasoning domains like mathematical problem-solving. Notably, GraphPRM enhances LLM performance on GSM8K and Math500, underscoring the cross-domain applicability of graph-based reasoning rewards. Our findings highlight the potential of PRMs in advancing reasoning across diverse domains, paving the way for more versatile and effective LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet open-source multilingual LLMs remain scarce, with existing models often limited in language coverage. Such models typically prioritize well-resourced languages, while widely spoken but under-resourced languages are often overlooked. To address this disparity, we introduce $\texttt{Babel}$, an open multilingual LLM that covers the top 25 languages by number of speakers, supports over 90% of the global population, and includes many languages neglected by other open multilingual LLMs. Unlike traditional continue pretraining approaches, Babel expands its parameter count through a layer extension technique that elevates Babel's performance ceiling. We introduce two variants: $\texttt{Babel-9B}$, designed for efficient inference and fine-tuning, and $\texttt{Babel-83B}$, which sets a new standard for open multilingual LLMs. Extensive evaluations on multilingual tasks demonstrate its superior performance compared to open LLMs of comparable size. In addition, using open-source supervised fine-tuning datasets, Babel achieves remarkable performance, with Babel-9B-Chat leading among 10B-sized LLMs and Babel-83B-Chat setting a new standard for multilingual tasks, reaching the same level of commercial models.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rise of large language models, neural text summarization has advanced significantly in recent years. However, even state-of-the-art models continue to rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data for training and evaluation. Active learning is frequently used as an effective way to collect such datasets, especially when annotation resources are scarce. Active learning methods typically prioritize either uncertainty or diversity but have shown limited effectiveness in summarization, often being outperformed by random sampling. We present Diversity and Uncertainty Active Learning (DUAL), a novel algorithm that combines uncertainty and diversity to iteratively select and annotate samples that are both representative of the data distribution and challenging for the current model. DUAL addresses the selection of noisy samples in uncertainty-based methods and the limited exploration scope of diversity-based methods. Through extensive experiments with different summarization models and benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that DUAL consistently matches or outperforms the best performing strategies. Using visualizations and quantitative metrics, we provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of different active learning strategies, in an attempt to understand why these strategies haven't performed consistently in text summarization. Finally, we show that DUAL strikes a good balance between diversity and robustness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liping Liu, Chunhong Zhang, Likang Wu, Chuang Zhao, Zheng Hu, Ming He, Jianping Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-reflection for Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained significant attention. Existing approaches involve models iterating and improving their previous responses based on LLMs' internal reflection ability or external feedback. However, recent research has raised doubts about whether intrinsic self-correction without external feedback may even degrade performance. Based on our empirical evidence, we find that current static reflection methods may lead to redundant, drift, and stubborn issues. To mitigate this, we introduce Instruct-of-Reflection (IoRT), a novel and general reflection framework that leverages dynamic-meta instruction to enhance the iterative reflection capability of LLMs. Specifically, we propose the instructor driven by the meta-thoughts and self-consistency classifier, generates various instructions, including refresh, stop, and select, to guide the next reflection iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that IoRT achieves an average improvement of 10.1% over established baselines in mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks, highlighting its efficacy and applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohang Jiang, Pangjing Wu, Ziran Liang, Peter Q. Chen, Xu Yuan, Ye Jia, Jiancheng Tu, Chen Li, Peter H. F. Ng, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Structure reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to reason about structured commonsense and answer multi-hop questions. However, existing benchmarks for structure reasoning mainly focus on horizontal and coordinate structures (\emph{e.g.} graphs), overlooking the hierarchical relationships within them. Hierarchical structure reasoning is crucial for human cognition, particularly in memory organization and problem-solving. It also plays a key role in various real-world tasks, such as information extraction and decision-making. To address this gap, we propose HiBench, the first framework spanning from initial structure generation to final proficiency assessment, designed to benchmark the hierarchical reasoning capabilities of LLMs systematically. HiBench encompasses six representative scenarios, covering both fundamental and practical aspects, and consists of 30 tasks with varying hierarchical complexity, totaling 39,519 queries. To evaluate LLMs comprehensively, we develop five capability dimensions that depict different facets of hierarchical structure understanding. Through extensive evaluation of 20 LLMs from 10 model families, we reveal key insights into their capabilities and limitations: 1) existing LLMs show proficiency in basic hierarchical reasoning tasks; 2) they still struggle with more complex structures and implicit hierarchical representations, especially in structural modification and textual reasoning. Based on these findings, we create a small yet well-designed instruction dataset, which enhances LLMs' performance on HiBench by an average of 88.84\% (Llama-3.1-8B) and 31.38\% (Qwen2.5-7B) across all tasks. The HiBench dataset and toolkit are available here, https://github.com/jzzzzh/HiBench, to encourage evaluation.</p>

Our approach balances precision and speed, achieving state-of-the-art results with 78.97\% strict accuracy on ISE-DSC01 and 80.82\% on ViWikiFC, securing 1st place in the UIT Data Science Challenge. Additionally, SemViQA Faster improves inference speed 7x while maintaining competitive accuracy. SemViQA sets a new benchmark for Vietnamese fact verification, advancing the fight against misinformation. The source code is available at: https://github.com/DAVID-NGUYEN-S16/SemViQA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Milad Alshomary, Nikhil Reddy Varimalla, Vishal Anand, Kathleen McKeown</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for the authorship attribution task that leverages the various linguistic representations learned at different layers of pre-trained transformer-based models. We evaluate our approach on three datasets, comparing it to a state-of-the-art baseline in in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. We found that utilizing various transformer layers improves the robustness of authorship attribution models when tested on out-of-domain data, resulting in new state-of-the-art results. Our analysis gives further insights into how our model's different layers get specialized in representing certain stylistic features that benefit the model when tested out of the domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ravi Ghadia, Avinash Kumar, Gaurav Jain, Prashant Nair, Poulami Das</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers rely on Key-Value (KV) caching to accelerate inference. However, the linear growth of the KV cache with context length leads to excessive memory consumption and bandwidth constraints. This bottleneck is particularly problematic in real-time applications -- such as chatbots and interactive assistants -- where low latency and high memory efficiency are critical. Existing methods drop distant tokens or compress states in a lossy manner, sacrificing accuracy by discarding vital context or introducing bias.
  We propose MorphKV, an inference-time technique that maintains a constant-sized KV cache while preserving accuracy. MorphKV balances long-range dependencies and local coherence during text generation. It eliminates early-token bias while retaining high-fidelity context by adaptively ranking tokens through correlation-aware selection. Unlike heuristic retention or lossy compression, MorphKV iteratively refines the KV cache via lightweight updates guided by attention patterns of recent tokens. This approach captures inter-token correlation with greater accuracy, crucial for tasks like content creation and code generation. Our studies on long-response tasks show 52.9$\%$ memory savings and 18.2$\%$ higher accuracy on average compared to state-of-the-art prior works, enabling efficient real-world deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bashar Alhafni, Nizar Habash</p>
<p>Abstract: Text editing frames grammatical error correction (GEC) as a sequence tagging problem, where edit tags are assigned to input tokens, and applying these edits results in the corrected text. This approach has gained attention for its efficiency and interpretability. However, while extensively explored for English, text editing remains largely underexplored for morphologically rich languages like Arabic. In this paper, we introduce a text editing approach that derives edit tags directly from data, eliminating the need for language-specific edits. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Arabic, a diglossic and morphologically rich language, and investigate the impact of different edit representations on model performance. Our approach achieves SOTA results on two Arabic GEC benchmarks and performs on par with SOTA on two others. Additionally, our models are over six times faster than existing Arabic GEC systems, making our approach more practical for real-world applications. Finally, we explore ensemble models, demonstrating how combining different models leads to further performance improvements. We make our code, data, and pretrained models publicly available.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> S{\l}awomir Dadas, Ma{\l}gorzata Gr\k{e}bowiec, Micha{\l} Pere{\l}kiewicz, Rafa{\l} Po\'swiata</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly proficient in processing and generating multilingual texts, which allows them to address real-world problems more effectively. However, language understanding is a far more complex issue that goes beyond simple text analysis. It requires familiarity with cultural context, including references to everyday life, historical events, traditions, folklore, literature, and pop culture. A lack of such knowledge can lead to misinterpretations and subtle, hard-to-detect errors. To examine language models' knowledge of the Polish cultural context, we introduce the Polish linguistic and cultural competency benchmark, consisting of 600 manually crafted questions. The benchmark is divided into six categories: history, geography, culture & tradition, art & entertainment, grammar, and vocabulary. As part of our study, we conduct an extensive evaluation involving over 30 open-weight and commercial LLMs. Our experiments provide a new perspective on Polish competencies in language models, moving past traditional natural language processing tasks and general knowledge assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Hou, Hal Daum\'e III, Rachel Rudinger</p>
<p>Abstract: Studies of human psychology have demonstrated that people are more motivated to extend empathy to in-group members than out-group members (Cikara et al., 2011). In this study, we investigate how this aspect of intergroup relations in humans is replicated by LLMs in an emotion intensity prediction task. In this task, the LLM is given a short description of an experience a person had that caused them to feel a particular emotion; the LLM is then prompted to predict the intensity of the emotion the person experienced on a numerical scale. By manipulating the group identities assigned to the LLM's persona (the "perceiver") and the person in the narrative (the "experiencer"), we measure how predicted emotion intensities differ between in-group and out-group settings. We observe that LLMs assign higher emotion intensity scores to in-group members than out-group members. This pattern holds across all three types of social groupings we tested: race/ethnicity, nationality, and religion. We perform an in-depth analysis on Llama-3.1-8B, the model which exhibited strongest intergroup bias among those tested.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bj\"orn Herrmann</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech-comprehension difficulties are common among older people. Standard speech tests do not fully capture such difficulties because the tests poorly resemble the context-rich, story-like nature of ongoing conversation and are typically available only in a country's dominant/official language (e.g., English), leading to inaccurate scores for native speakers of other languages. Assessments for naturalistic, story speech in multiple languages require accurate, time-efficient scoring. The current research leverages modern large language models (LLMs) in native English speakers and native speakers of 10 other languages to automate the generation of high-quality, spoken stories and scoring of speech recall in different languages. Participants listened to and freely recalled short stories (in quiet/clear and in babble noise) in their native language. LLM text-embeddings and LLM prompt engineering with semantic similarity analyses to score speech recall revealed sensitivity to known effects of temporal order, primacy/recency, and background noise, and high similarity of recall scores across languages. The work overcomes limitations associated with simple speech materials and testing of closed native-speaker groups because recall data of varying length and details can be mapped across languages with high accuracy. The full automation of speech generation and recall scoring provides an important step towards comprehension assessments of naturalistic speech with clinical applicability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Noever</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the potential for large language models (LLMs) to develop private tonal languages for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Inspired by cryptophasia in human twins (affecting up to 50% of twin births) and natural tonal languages like Mandarin and Vietnamese, we implement a precise character-to-frequency mapping system that encodes the full ASCII character set (32-126) using musical semitones. Each character is assigned a unique frequency, creating a logarithmic progression beginning with space (220 Hz) and ending with tilde (50,175.42 Hz). This spans approximately 7.9 octaves, with higher characters deliberately mapped to ultrasonic frequencies beyond human perception (>20 kHz). Our implemented software prototype demonstrates this encoding through visualization, auditory playback, and ABC musical notation, allowing for analysis of information density and transmission speed. Testing reveals that tonal encoding can achieve information rates exceeding human speech while operating partially outside human perceptual boundaries. This work responds directly to concerns about AI systems catastrophically developing private languages within the next five years, providing a concrete prototype software example of how such communication might function and the technical foundation required for its emergence, detection, and governance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanyi Ding, Zhongyan Wang, Yeyubei Zhang, Yuchen Cao, Yunchong Liu, Xiaorui Shen, Yexin Tian, Jianglai Dai</p>
<p>Abstract: Social media platforms provide valuable insights into mental health trends by capturing user-generated discussions on conditions such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have been increasingly applied to classify mental health conditions from textual data, but selecting the most effective model involves trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study evaluates multiple ML models, including logistic regression, random forest, and LightGBM, alongside deep learning architectures such as ALBERT and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), for both binary and multi-class classification of mental health conditions. Our findings indicate that ML and DL models achieve comparable classification performance on medium-sized datasets, with ML models offering greater interpretability through variable importance scores, while DL models are more robust to complex linguistic patterns. Additionally, ML models require explicit feature engineering, whereas DL models learn hierarchical representations directly from text. Logistic regression provides the advantage of capturing both positive and negative associations between features and mental health conditions, whereas tree-based models prioritize decision-making power through split-based feature selection. This study offers empirical insights into the advantages and limitations of different modeling approaches and provides recommendations for selecting appropriate methods based on dataset size, interpretability needs, and computational constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haowen Pan, Xiaozhi Wang, Yixin Cao, Zenglin Shi, Xun Yang, Juanzi Li, Meng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update outdated information in Large Language Models (LLMs). A representative line of study is locate-then-edit methods, which typically employ causal tracing to identify the modules responsible for recalling factual knowledge about entities. However, we find these methods are often sensitive only to changes in the subject entity, leaving them less effective at adapting to changes in relations. This limitation results in poor editing locality, which can lead to the persistence of irrelevant or inaccurate facts, ultimately compromising the reliability of LLMs. We believe this issue arises from the insufficient precision of knowledge localization. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing (FiNE) method that enhances editing locality without affecting overall success rates. By precisely identifying and modifying specific neurons within feed-forward networks, FiNE significantly improves knowledge localization and editing. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that FiNE efficiently achieves better overall performance compared to existing techniques, providing new insights into the localization and modification of knowledge within LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shivam Ratnakar, Abhiroop Talasila, Raghav Chamadiya, Nikhil Agarwal, Vinayak K Doifode</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an extensive examination of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for embedding domain specific facts into Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on improving the fine-tuning process by categorizing question-answer (QA) pairs into Factual and Conceptual classes using a BERT-based classifier. Two distinct Llama-2 models are fine-tuned based on these classifications and evaluated using larger models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini. Our results indicate that models trained on conceptual datasets outperform those trained on factual datasets. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of two synthetic fine-tuning dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive, with D-Naive demonstrating superior performance. Although PEFT has shown effectiveness, our research indicates that it may not be the most optimal method for embedding facts into LLMs. However, it has demonstrated exceptional performance in instruction-based tasks. Our findings are reinforced by a 1000-sample dataset in the data center domain, where the fine-tuned Llama-2 7B model significantly outperforms the baseline model in generating product recommendations. Our study highlights the importance of QA pair categorization and synthetic dataset generation techniques in enhancing the performance of LLMs in specific domains.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01141">How Well do LLMs Compress Their Own Chain-of-Thought? A Token Complexity Approach</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayeong Lee, Ethan Che, Tianyi Peng</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks. However, these reasoning chains can be verbose, raising concerns about efficiency. In response, recent works have sought to decrease response lengths through simple prompting strategies (e.g. 'be concise'). In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of the relationship between reasoning length and model performance across a diverse range of compression instructions (e.g. 'use 10 words or less' or 'remove all punctuation'). In doing so, we discover a universal tradeoff between reasoning length and accuracy that persists across even very distinct reasoning chains. We demonstrate that this tradeoff emerges from a sharp threshold behavior at the question level: each task has an intrinsic 'token complexity' - a minimal number of tokens required for successful problem-solving. We show how token complexity enables us to compute information-theoretic limits on the accuracy-compression tradeoff, and find that prompt-based compression strategies operate far from these theoretical limits. This suggests there may be significant room for improvement and our framework provides a benchmark to help researchers evaluate progress in reasoning efficiency. Our work also highlights the importance of adaptive compression -- giving shorter responses for easier questions -- and we show that token complexity is a useful tool for measuring this capability.</p>

MiLiC-Eval focuses on underrepresented writing systems and provides a fine-grained assessment of linguistic and problem-solving skills. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform poorly on syntax-intensive tasks and multi-script languages.

<p>Abstract: Evolution, the engine behind the survival and growth of life on Earth, operates through the population-based process of reproduction. Inspired by this principle, this paper formally defines a newly emerging problem -- the population-based evolution of large language models (LLMs) -- and introduces a novel framework. Starting with a population of parent LLMs, our framework enables the population to evolve through four key operations: (i) crossover, merging the weights of different parents to create offspring LLMs, (ii) mutation, introducing small, random changes to model weights to foster diversity, (iii) selection, prioritizing high-performing models, and (iv) succession, transferring the learned experience from parent to offspring LLMs. With only 200 samples per new task, the LLM population evolves rapidly to adapt to the task at hand, without any gradients. Experiments on 12 datasets show that our framework consistently outperforms existing multi-LLM merging and adaptation methods, achieving accuracy gains of up to 54.8% over the best LLM in the initial population. Moreover, our framework allows for the evolution of LLMs across multiple new tasks simultaneously, scaling effectively with populations of up to 40 LLMs, and even zero-shot generalization to unseen held-out tasks. We have open-sourced the code on GitHub and released the weights of 10 parent LLMs, fine-tuned from gemma-2-2b-it, on HuggingFace$, enabling reproduction of our proposed framework using just a single 4090 GPU with 24GB memory, without any performance degradation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hajar Sakai, Sarah S. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks across diverse domains. In healthcare, accurate and cost-efficient text classification is crucial, whether for clinical notes analysis, diagnosis coding, or any other task, and LLMs present promising potential. Text classification has always faced multiple challenges, including manual annotation for training, handling imbalanced data, and developing scalable approaches. With healthcare, additional challenges are added, particularly the critical need to preserve patients' data privacy and the complexity of the medical terminology. Numerous studies have been conducted to leverage LLMs for automated healthcare text classification and contrast the results with existing machine learning-based methods where embedding, annotation, and training are traditionally required. Existing systematic reviews about LLMs either do not specialize in text classification or do not focus on the healthcare domain. This research synthesizes and critically evaluates the current evidence found in the literature regarding the use of LLMs for text classification in a healthcare setting. Major databases (e.g., Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct) and other resources were queried, which focused on the papers published between 2018 and 2024 within the framework of PRISMA guidelines, which resulted in 65 eligible research articles. These were categorized by text classification type (e.g., binary classification, multi-label classification), application (e.g., clinical decision support, public health and opinion analysis), methodology, type of healthcare text, and metrics used for evaluation and validation. This review reveals the existing gaps in the literature and suggests future research lines that can be investigated and explored.</p>

<p>Abstract: The recent wave of audio foundation models (FMs) could provide new capabilities for conversational modeling. However, there have been limited efforts to evaluate these audio FMs comprehensively on their ability to have natural and interactive conversations. To engage in meaningful conversation with the end user, we would want the FMs to additionally perform a fluent succession of turns without too much overlapping speech or long stretches of silence. Inspired by this, we ask whether the recently proposed audio FMs can understand, predict, and perform turn-taking events? To answer this, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that can assess spoken dialog system's turn-taking capabilities using a supervised model as a judge that has been trained to predict turn-taking events in human-human conversations. Using this protocol, we present the first comprehensive user study that evaluates existing spoken dialogue systems on their ability to perform turn-taking events and reveal many interesting insights, such as they sometimes do not understand when to speak up, can interrupt too aggressively and rarely backchannel. We further evaluate multiple open-source and proprietary audio FMs accessible through APIs on carefully curated test benchmarks from Switchboard to measure their ability to understand and predict turn-taking events and identify significant room for improvement. We will open source our evaluation platform to promote the development of advanced conversational AI systems.</p>

In this project, we leverage state-of-the-art language models, including the GPT family, Mistral models, and the open-source Llama models, to evaluate their performance in comprehensively analyzing pathology reports. Specifically, we assess their performance in cancer type identification, AJCC stage determination, and prognosis assessment, encompassing both information extraction and higher-order reasoning tasks. Based on a detailed analysis of their performance metrics in a zero-shot setting, we developed two instruction-tuned models: Path-llama3.1-8B and Path-GPT-4o-mini-FT.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The alignment of large language models with human values presents a critical challenge, particularly when balancing conflicting objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. Existing approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), face notable limitations: RLHF suffers from instability and inefficiency in multi-objective optimization, while DPO lacks mechanisms for dynamic trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose Post-Training Extrapolation Optimization (PEO), a novel and efficient framework for bi-factorial alignment. PEO generates a family of Pareto-optimal policies in a single training pass by leveraging a three-phase pipeline: (1) aspect-specific learning, (2) generalist initialization via interpolation, and (3) post-training optimization via extrapolation. PEO enables dynamic adaptation to diverse user preferences at inference time without retraining. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that PEO achieves superior Pareto fronts compared to baselines, offering improved flexibility and computational efficiency.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Timothee Mickus, Aman Sinha, Ra\'ul V\'azquez</p>
<p>Abstract: The difficulty intrinsic to a given example, rooted in its inherent ambiguity, is a key yet often overlooked factor in evaluating neural NLP models. We investigate the interplay and divergence among various metrics for assessing intrinsic difficulty, including annotator dissensus, training dynamics, and model confidence. Through a comprehensive analysis using 29 models on three datasets, we reveal that while correlations exist among these metrics, their relationships are neither linear nor monotonic. By disentangling these dimensions of uncertainty, we aim to refine our understanding of data complexity and its implications for evaluating and improving NLP models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Davide Garassino, Nicola Brocca, Viviana Masia</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines ChatGPT-4's capability to replicate linguistic strategies used in political discourse, focusing on its potential for manipulative language generation. As large language models become increasingly popular for text generation, concerns have grown regarding their role in spreading fake news and propaganda. This research compares real political speeches with those generated by ChatGPT, emphasizing presuppositions (a rhetorical device that subtly influences audiences by packaging some content as already known at the moment of utterance, thus swaying opinions without explicit argumentation). Using a corpus-based pragmatic analysis, this study assesses how well ChatGPT can mimic these persuasive strategies. The findings reveal that although ChatGPT-generated texts contain many manipulative presuppositions, key differences emerge in their frequency, form, and function compared with those of politicians. For instance, ChatGPT often relies on change-of-state verbs used in fixed phrases, whereas politicians use presupposition triggers in more varied and creative ways. Such differences, however, are challenging to detect with the naked eye, underscoring the potential risks posed by large language models in political and public discourse.Using a corpus-based pragmatic analysis, this study assesses how well ChatGPT can mimic these persuasive strategies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenshuai Huo, Xiaocheng Feng, Yichong Huang, Chengpeng Fu, Baohang Li, Yangfan Ye, Zhirui Zhang, Dandan Tu, Duyu Tang, Yunfei Lu, Hui Wang, Bing Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in multilingual language understanding and generation. However, due to the imbalance in training data, their capabilities in non-English languages are limited. Recent studies revealed the English-pivot multilingual mechanism of LLMs, where LLMs implicitly convert non-English queries into English ones at the bottom layers and adopt English for thinking at the middle layers. However, due to the absence of explicit supervision for cross-lingual alignment in the intermediate layers of LLMs, the internal representations during these stages may become inaccurate. In this work, we introduce a deep supervision fine-tuning method (DFT) that incorporates additional supervision in the internal layers of the model to guide its workflow. Specifically, we introduce two training objectives on different layers of LLMs: one at the bottom layers to constrain the conversion of the target language into English, and another at the middle layers to constrain reasoning in English. To effectively achieve the guiding purpose, we designed two types of supervision signals: logits and feature, which represent a stricter constraint and a relatively more relaxed guidance. Our method guides the model to not only consider the final generated result when processing non-English inputs but also ensure the accuracy of internal representations. We conducted extensive experiments on typical English-centric large models, LLaMA-2 and Gemma-2, and the results on multiple multilingual datasets show that our method significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sakiko Yahata, Zhen Wan, Fei Cheng, Sadao Kurohashi, Hisahiko Sato, Ryozo Nagai</p>
<p>Abstract: Extracting causal relationships from a medical case report is essential for comprehending the case, particularly its diagnostic process. Since the diagnostic process is regarded as a bottom-up inference, causal relationships in cases naturally form a multi-layered tree structure. The existing tasks, such as medical relation extraction, are insufficient for capturing the causal relationships of an entire case, as they treat all relations equally without considering the hierarchical structure inherent in the diagnostic process. Thus, we propose a novel task, Causal Tree Extraction (CTE), which receives a case report and generates a causal tree with the primary disease as the root, providing an intuitive understanding of a case's diagnostic process. Subsequently, we construct a Japanese case report CTE dataset, J-Casemap, propose a generation-based CTE method that outperforms the baseline by 20.2 points in the human evaluation, and introduce evaluation metrics that reflect clinician preferences. Further experiments also show that J-Casemap enhances the performance of solving other medical tasks, such as question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhai Zhang, Jialong Wu, Deyu Zhou, Yulan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) aim to tailor their outputs to user preferences. Recent advances in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have highlighted the effectiveness of adapting population-level LLMs to personalized LLMs by fine-tuning user-specific parameters with user history. However, user data is typically sparse, making it challenging to adapt LLMs to specific user patterns. To address this challenge, we propose PROgressive PERsonalization (PROPER), a novel progressive learning framework inspired by meso-level theory in social science. PROPER bridges population-level and user-level models by grouping users based on preferences and adapting LLMs in stages. It combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure with Low Ranked Adaptation (LoRA), using a user-aware router to assign users to appropriate groups automatically. Additionally, a LoRA-aware router is proposed to facilitate the integration of individual user LoRAs with group-level LoRAs. Experimental results show that PROPER significantly outperforms SOTA models across multiple tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kanishk Gandhi, Ayush Chakravarthy, Anikait Singh, Nathan Lile, Noah D. Goodman</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linhai Zhang, Ziyang Gao, Deyu Zhou, Yulan He</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, and clinical interviews are the gold standard for assessment. However, their reliance on scarce professionals highlights the need for automated detection. Current systems mainly employ black-box neural networks, which lack interpretability, which is crucial in mental health contexts. Some attempts to improve interpretability use post-hoc LLM generation but suffer from hallucination. To address these limitations, we propose RED, a Retrieval-augmented generation framework for Explainable depression Detection. RED retrieves evidence from clinical interview transcripts, providing explanations for predictions. Traditional query-based retrieval systems use a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not be optimal for depression detection, as user backgrounds and situations vary. We introduce a personalized query generation module that combines standard queries with user-specific background inferred by LLMs, tailoring retrieval to individual contexts. Additionally, to enhance LLM performance in social intelligence, we augment LLMs by retrieving relevant knowledge from a social intelligence datastore using an event-centric retriever. Experimental results on the real-world benchmark demonstrate RED's effectiveness compared to neural networks and LLM-based baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Yuan, Ziwei He, Haoli Bai, Jingwen Leng, Bo Jiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) use key-value (KV) cache to reduce redundant computation in autoregressive generation. However, the KV cache size increases linearly during generation, leading to excessive memory usage, especially for long texts. Most KV cache compression methods evict the unimportant KV pairs to maintain a fixed cache size, which leads to the permanent loss of tokens during generation. However, singular value decomposition shows that \textit{values} do not exhibit a strong low-rank property as \textit{keys} do, suggesting that information is distributed more evenly across \textit{values}, in contrast to its more redundant distribution within \textit{keys}. Therefore, methods that evict both \textit{keys} and \textit{values} risk losing crucial information and compromise context integrity, ultimately degrading the output quality. To address this problem, we propose WeightedKV, a novel, training-free approach that discards the \textit{keys} of less important tokens, while merging their \textit{values} into neighboring tokens via a convex combination weighted by their average attention scores. In this way, the retained \textit{keys} serve as anchors that guide the generation process, while the merged \textit{values} provide a rich contextual backdrop. We assess our method on four widely used language modeling datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to all baseline methods, particularly with a lower budget ratio.</p>

Our findings show that even cutting-edge LMs--both regular and reasoning models--still require explicit prompt chaining to handle the task effectively, revealing the challenges that must be overcome to achieve truly autonomous decision-making agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tingchen Fu, Fazl Barez</p>
<p>Abstract: Insensitivity to semantically-preserving variations of prompts (paraphrases) is crucial for reliable behavior and real-world deployment of large language models. However, language models exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with semantically equivalent but differently phrased prompts, and existing solutions either depend on trial-and-error prompt engineering or require computationally expensive inference-time algorithms. In this study, built on the key insight that worst-case prompts exhibit a drift in embedding space, we present Latent Adversarial Paraphrasing (LAP), a dual-loop adversarial framework: the inner loop trains a learnable perturbation to serve as a "latent continuous paraphrase" while preserving semantics through Lagrangian regulation, and the outer loop optimizes the language model parameters on these perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of LAP across multiple LLM architectures on the RobustAlpaca benchmark with a 0.5%-4% absolution improvement on worst-case win-rate compared with vanilla supervised fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng Lin, Yizhang Zhu, Yuyu Luo, Nan Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-entity question answering (MEQA) poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle to consolidate scattered information across multiple documents. An example question might be "What is the distribution of IEEE Fellows among various fields of study?", which requires retrieving information from diverse sources e.g., Wikipedia pages. The effectiveness of current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods is limited by the LLMs' capacity to aggregate insights from numerous pages. To address this gap, this paper introduces a structured RAG (SRAG) framework that systematically organizes extracted entities into relational tables (e.g., tabulating entities with schema columns like "name" and "field of study") and then apply table-based reasoning techniques. Our approach decouples retrieval and reasoning, enabling LLMs to focus on structured data analysis rather than raw text aggregation. Extensive experiments on Wikipedia-based multi-entity QA tasks demonstrate that SRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art long-context LLMs and RAG solutions, achieving a 29.6% improvement in accuracy. The results underscore the efficacy of structuring unstructured data to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: In Switzerland legal translation is uniquely important due to the country's four official languages and requirements for multilingual legal documentation. However, this process traditionally relies on professionals who must be both legal experts and skilled translators -- creating bottlenecks and impacting effective access to justice. To address this challenge, we introduce SwiLTra-Bench, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark of over 180K aligned Swiss legal translation pairs comprising laws, headnotes, and press releases across all Swiss languages along with English, designed to evaluate LLM-based translation systems. Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality, they still lag behind the best zero-shot prompted frontier models such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Additionally, we present SwiLTra-Judge, a specialized LLM evaluation system that aligns best with human expert assessments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Question answering (QA) requires accurately aligning user questions with structured queries, a process often limited by the scarcity of high-quality query-natural language (Q-NL) pairs. To overcome this, we present Q-NL Verifier, an approach to generating high-quality synthetic pairs of queries and NL translations. Our approach relies on large language models (LLMs) to generate semantically precise natural language paraphrases of structured queries. Building on these synthetic Q-NL pairs, we introduce a learned verifier component that automatically determines whether a generated paraphrase is semantically equivalent to the original query. Our experiments with the well-known LC-QuAD 2.0 benchmark show that Q-NL Verifier generalizes well to paraphrases from other models and even human-authored translations. Our approach strongly aligns with human judgments across varying query complexities and outperforms existing NLP metrics in assessing semantic correctness. We also integrate the verifier into QA pipelines, showing that verifier-filtered synthetic data has significantly higher quality in terms of translation correctness and enhances NL to Q translation accuracy. Lastly, we release an updated version of the LC-QuAD 2.0 benchmark containing our synthetic Q-NL pairs and verifier scores, offering a new resource for robust and scalable QA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonardo Nizzoli, Marco Avvenuti, Maurizio Tesconi, Stefano Cresci</p>
<p>Abstract: Online social networks convey rich information about geospatial facets of reality. However in most cases, geographic information is not explicit and structured, thus preventing its exploitation in real-time applications. We address this limitation by introducing a novel geoparsing and geotagging technique called Geo-Semantic-Parsing (GSP). GSP identifies location references in free text and extracts the corresponding geographic coordinates. To reach this goal, we employ a semantic annotator to identify relevant portions of the input text and to link them to the corresponding entity in a knowledge graph. Then, we devise and experiment with several efficient strategies for traversing the knowledge graph, thus expanding the available set of information for the geoparsing task. Finally, we exploit all available information for learning a regression model that selects the best entity with which to geotag the input text. We evaluate GSP on a well-known reference dataset including almost 10k event-related tweets, achieving $F1=0.66$. We extensively compare our results with those of 2 baselines and 3 state-of-the-art geoparsing techniques, achieving the best performance. On the same dataset, competitors obtain $F1 \leq 0.55$. We conclude by providing in-depth analyses of our results, showing that the overall superior performance of GSP is mainly due to a large improvement in recall, with respect to existing techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia-Chen Zhang, Yu-Jie Xiong, Chun-Ming Xia, Dong-Hai Zhu, Xi-He Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is considered a milestone towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). With its advanced emergent capabilities, it adapt to a wide range of specific applications. Fine-tuning LLMs for various downstream tasks has become a new paradigm. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is well-known for its parameter efficiency. It can reduce the number of parameters needed to fine-tune LLMs by several orders of magnitude. However, LoRA-based approaches encounter a significant limitation due to the bottleneck imposed by rank one decomposition. As the parameters count in LLMs increase, even rank one decomposition might surpass the number of parameters truly necessary for handling more downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a new method for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) via deconvolution in subspace, dubbed as DCFT. We innovatively use deconvolution to complete details and enhance knowledge in subspace incremental matrices, and dynamically control parameters by adjusting the kernel size, unconstrained by rank-one decomposition. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DCFT. Results show that compared to LoRA, DCFT achieve an 8$\times$ reduction in parameters, and still achieves highly impressive performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiming Wang, Pei Zhang, Siyuan Huang, Baosong Yang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Fei Huang, Rui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language model performance by adding extra compute during decoding. Best-of-N (BoN) sampling serves as a common scaling technique, broadening the search space for finding better solutions from the model distribution. However, traditional BoN requires N full generations, leading to high GPU memory overhead and time latency. Moreover, some methods depend on reward models, adding computational cost and limiting domain generalization.
  In this paper, we propose Self-Truncation Best-of-N (ST-BoN), a novel decoding method that avoids fully generating all samplings and eliminates the need for reward models. ST-BoN introduces early sampling consistency to estimate the most promising sample, truncating suboptimal ones to free memory and accelerate inference. This pushes the sampling-efficient test-time scaling. Compared to traditional BoN, ST-BoN can reduce dynamic GPU memory overhead by over 90% and time latency by 50%, while achieving comparable or even better performance across reasoning and open-ended domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks, performed on domain-specific data has shown significant promise. However, commercial use of such LLMs is limited by the high computational cost required for their deployment at scale. On the other hand, small Language Models (LMs) are much more cost effective but have subpar performance in a similar setup. This paper presents our approach to finetuning a small LM, that reaches high accuracy in multiple choice question answering task. We achieve this by improving data quality at each stage of the LM training pipeline. In particular, we start with data structuring resulting in extraction of compact, semantically meaningful text chunks used by a retriever. This allows more efficient knowledge digestion by the LM. Further, we improve the retrieved context by training a lightweight Chunk Re-Ranker (CRR) that generates more accurate relative relevance chunk scores. Finally, we improve the model generalization ability by merging the models fine-tuned with different parameters on different data subsets. We present detailed procedure descriptions, and corresponding experimental findings that show the improvements of each one of the proposed techniques.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lu Dai, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent research advancements within the community, large language models (LLMs) have sparked great interest in creating autonomous agents. However, current prompt-based agents often heavily rely on large-scale LLMs. Meanwhile, although fine-tuning methods significantly enhance the capabilities of smaller LLMs, the fine-tuned agents often lack the potential for self-reflection and self-improvement. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel agent framework named RetroAct, which is a framework that jointly optimizes both task-planning and self-reflective evolution capabilities in language agents. Specifically, we develop a two-stage joint optimization process that integrates imitation learning and reinforcement learning, and design an off-policy joint policy gradient optimization algorithm with imitation learning regularization to enhance the data efficiency and training stability in agent tasks. RetroAct significantly improves the performance of open-source models, reduces dependency on closed-source LLMs, and enables fine-tuned agents to learn and evolve continuously. We conduct extensive experiments across various testing environments, demonstrating RetroAct has substantial improvements in task performance and decision-making processes.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01496">Liger: Linearizing Large Language Models to Gated Recurrent Structures</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Disen Lan, Weigao Sun, Jiaxi Hu, Jusen Du, Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers with linear recurrent modeling offer linear-time training and constant-memory inference. Despite their demonstrated efficiency and performance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains costly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms pretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more efficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically introduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and overlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent models. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for Linearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for converting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding extra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct diverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated recurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components from scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Liger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to match that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an intra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\% of the Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\% pre-training tokens during the linearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Xi, Deyang Kong, Jian Yang, Jiawei Yang, Zhengyu Chen, Wei Wang, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Shikun Zhang, Wei Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing pretraining data mixing methods for large language models (LLMs) typically follow a domain-wise methodology, a top-down process that first determines domain weights and then performs uniform data sampling across each domain. However, these approaches neglect significant inter-domain overlaps and commonalities, failing to control the global diversity of the constructed training dataset. Further, uniform sampling within domains ignores fine-grained sample-specific features, potentially leading to suboptimal data distribution. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel sample-wise data mixture approach based on a bottom-up paradigm. This method performs global cross-domain sampling by systematically evaluating the quality and diversity of each sample, thereby dynamically determining the optimal domain distribution. Comprehensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks and perplexity assessments demonstrate that SampleMix surpasses existing domain-based methods. Meanwhile, SampleMix requires 1.4x to 2.1x training steps to achieves the baselines' performance, highlighting the substantial potential of SampleMix to optimize pre-training data.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present KoWit-24, a dataset with fine-grained annotation of wordplay in 2,700 Russian news headlines. KoWit-24 annotations include the presence of wordplay, its type, wordplay anchors, and words/phrases the wordplay refers to. Unlike the majority of existing humor collections of canned jokes, KoWit-24 provides wordplay contexts -- each headline is accompanied by the news lead and summary. The most common type of wordplay in the dataset is the transformation of collocations, idioms, and named entities -- the mechanism that has been underrepresented in previous humor datasets. Our experiments with five LLMs show that there is ample room for improvement in wordplay detection and interpretation tasks.

<p>Abstract: We present a survey of methods for assessing and enhancing the quality of online discussions, focusing on the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Recent advancements in LLMs enable facilitation agents that not only moderate content, but also actively improve the quality of interactions. Our survey synthesizes ideas from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Social Sciences to provide (a) a new taxonomy on discussion quality evaluation, (b) an overview of intervention and facilitation strategies, along with a new taxonomy on conversation facilitation datasets, (c) an LLM-oriented roadmap of good practices and future research directions, from technological and societal perspectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Chen, Shuo Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques. However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-v2.5 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to both direct prompting and Chain-of-Thought. In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Model pruning technique is vital for accelerating large language models by reducing their size and computational requirements. However, the generalizability of existing pruning methods across diverse datasets and tasks remains unclear. Thus, we conduct extensive evaluations on 24 datasets and 4 tasks using popular pruning methods. Based on these evaluations, we find and then investigate that calibration set greatly affect the performance of pruning methods. In addition, we surprisingly find a significant performance drop of existing pruning methods in sentiment classification tasks. To understand the link between performance drop and pruned neurons, we propose Neuron Semantic Attribution, which learns to associate each neuron with specific semantics. This method first makes the unpruned neurons of LLMs explainable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lisa Lepp, Dimitar Shterionov, Mirella De Sisto, Grzegorz Chrupa{\l}a</p>
<p>Abstract: Sign language machine translation (SLMT) -- the task of automatically translating between sign and spoken languages or between sign languages -- is a complex task within the field of NLP. Its multi-modal and non-linear nature require the joint efforts of sign language (SL) linguists, technical experts and SL users. Effective user involvement is a challenge that can be addressed through co-creation. Co-creation has been formally defined in many fields, e.g. business, marketing, educational and others, however in NLP and in particular in SLMT there is no formal, widely accepted definition. Starting from the inception and evolution of co-creation across various fields over time, we develop a relationship typology to address the collaboration between deaf, Hard of Hearing and hearing researchers and the co-creation with SL-users. We compare this new typology to the guiding principles of participatory design for NLP. We, then, assess 110 articles from the perspective of involvement of SL users and highlight the lack of involvement of the sign language community or users in decision-making processes required for effective co-creation. Finally, we derive formal guidelines for co-creation for SLMT which take the dynamic nature of co-creation throughout the life cycle of a research project into account.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eli Sason, Darya Frolova, Boris Nazarov, Felix Goldberd</p>
<p>Abstract: As the context window expands, self-attention increasingly dominates the transformer's inference time. Therefore, accelerating attention computation while minimizing performance degradation is essential for the efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this study we extend a theoretical framework of attention sparsity in LLMs. A customized loss function is designed to enforce the sparsity by restricting the number of top elements in the attention matrix. We perform an initial set of evaluations with GPT-2 to show the effectiveness of our sparsification approach. The attention matrices of the models trained with the proposed loss are both sparse and effective in capturing relevant input dependencies. We now continue working to demonstrate the value of our approach on larger models and different architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhanghao Hu, Hanqi Yan, Qingling Zhu, Zhenyi Shen, Yulan He, Lin Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models have recently pushed open domain question answering (ODQA) to new frontiers. However, prevailing retriever-reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose EmbQA, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Specifically, we refine query representations via lightweight linear layers under an unsupervised contrastive learning objective, thereby reordering retrieved passages to highlight those most likely to contain correct answers. Additionally, we introduce an exploratory embedding that broadens the model's latent semantic space to diversify candidate generation and employs an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most confident answer automatically. Extensive experiments across three open-source LLMs, three retrieval methods, and four ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that EmbQA substantially outperforms recent baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Ponce, Thierry Etchegoyhen</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction following is a critical ability for Large Language Models to perform downstream tasks. The standard approach to instruction alignment has relied on a specific phase of model tuning over curated instruction datasets, optionally complemented with an alignment step over human preferences. Recent work has shown the potential of in-context learning (ICL) alternatives to guide base models towards instruction following. This type of approach is particularly relevant to extend instruction following across languages and models of varying sizes adapted to different types of usage. In this work we compare ICL and instruction fine-tuning in English, French and Spanish, on Small Language Models, and provide experimental results on applying Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) over base models. Our results show that scenarios involving multilingual and smaller models result in downgraded ICL instruction following performance, only partially mitigated by DPO alignment. This study aims to further our understanding of current strengths and limitations of alternative methods for instruction following.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent work found that LLMs are sensitive to a wide range of arbitrary prompt dimensions, including the type of delimiters, answer enumerators, instruction wording, and more. This throws into question popular single-prompt evaluation practices. We present DOVE (Dataset Of Variation Evaluation) a large-scale dataset containing prompt perturbations of various evaluation benchmarks. In contrast to previous work, we examine LLM sensitivity from an holistic perspective, and assess the joint effects of perturbations along various dimensions, resulting in thousands of perturbations per instance. We evaluate several model families against DOVE, leading to several findings, including efficient methods for choosing well-performing prompts, observing that few-shot examples reduce sensitivity, and identifying instances which are inherently hard across all perturbations. DOVE consists of more than 250M prompt perturbations and model outputs, which we make publicly available to spur a community-wide effort toward meaningful, robust, and efficient evaluation.

<p>Abstract: Numeral systems across the world's languages vary in fascinating ways, both regarding their synchronic structure and the diachronic processes that determined how they evolved in their current shape. For a proper comparison of numeral systems across different languages, however, it is important to code them in a standardized form that allows for the comparison of basic properties. Here, we present a simple but effective coding scheme for numeral annotation, along with a workflow that helps to code numeral systems in a computer-assisted manner, providing sample data for numerals from 1 to 40 in 25 typologically diverse languages. We perform a thorough analysis of the sample, focusing on the systematic comparison between the underlying and the surface morphological structure. We further experiment with automated models for morpheme segmentation, where we find allomorphy as the major reason for segmentation errors. Finally, we show that subword tokenization algorithms are not viable for discovering morphemes in low-resource scenarios.</p>

To test the functionalist thesis that speakers' expressive purposes shape their language, we include within the model a probability distribution over different messages that could be expressed in a given context. The proposed learning and production algorithm then breaks down language learning into a sequence of simple steps, such that each step benefits from the message probabilities.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yehonatan Bitton, Elad Bitton, Shai Nisan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have distinct and consistent stylistic fingerprints, even when prompted to write in different writing styles. Detecting these fingerprints is important for many reasons, among them protecting intellectual property, ensuring transparency regarding AI-generated content, and preventing the misuse of AI technologies. In this paper, we present a novel method to classify texts based on the stylistic fingerprints of the models that generated them. We introduce an LLM-detection ensemble that is composed of three classifiers with varied architectures and training data. This ensemble is trained to classify texts generated by four well-known LLM families: Claude, Gemini, Llama, and OpenAI. As this task is highly cost-sensitive and might have severe implications, we want to minimize false-positives and increase confidence. We consider a prediction as valid when all three classifiers in the ensemble unanimously agree on the output classification. Our ensemble is validated on a test set of texts generated by Claude, Gemini, Llama, and OpenAI models, and achieves extremely high precision (0.9988) and a very low false-positive rate (0.0004). Furthermore, we demonstrate the ensemble's ability to distinguish between texts generated by seen and unseen models. This reveals interesting stylistic relationships between models. This approach to stylistic analysis has implications for verifying the originality of AI-generated texts and tracking the origins of model training techniques.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a widely adopted approach for text quality evaluation, including hallucination evaluation. While previous studies have focused exclusively on single-context evaluation (e.g., discourse faithfulness or world factuality), real-world hallucinations typically involve mixed contexts, which remains inadequately evaluated. In this study, we use summarization as a representative task to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting mixed-context hallucinations, specifically distinguishing between factual and non-factual hallucinations. Through extensive experiments across direct generation and retrieval-based models of varying scales, our main observations are: (1) LLMs' intrinsic knowledge introduces inherent biases in hallucination evaluation; (2) These biases particularly impact the detection of factual hallucinations, yielding a significant performance bottleneck; (3) The fundamental challenge lies in effective knowledge utilization, balancing between LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and external context for accurate mixed-context hallucination evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao Liu, Zirui Wu, Jiayi Li, Zhicheng Shao, Xun Pang, Yansong Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Longitudinal network data are essential for analyzing political, economic, and social systems and processes. In political science, these datasets are often generated through human annotation or supervised machine learning applied to evolving corpora. However, as semantic contexts shift over time, inferring dynamic interaction types on emerging issues among a diverse set of entities poses significant challenges, particularly in maintaining timely and consistent annotations. This paper presents the Expert-Augmented LLM Annotation (EALA) approach, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) in combination with historically annotated data and expert-constructed codebooks to extrapolate and extend datasets into future periods. We evaluate the performance and reliability of EALA using a dataset of climate negotiations. Our findings demonstrate that EALA effectively predicts nuanced interactions between negotiation parties and captures the evolution of topics over time. At the same time, we identify several limitations inherent to LLM-based annotation, highlighting areas for further improvement. Given the wide availability of codebooks and annotated datasets, EALA holds substantial promise for advancing research in political science and beyond.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Petr Sychev, Andrey Goncharov, Daniil Vyazhev, Edvard Khalafyan, Alexey Zaytsev</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes domains where incorrect answers result in significant consequences. Numerous approaches consider this problem, while focusing on a specific type of uncertainty, ignoring others. We investigate what estimates, specifically token-wise entropy and model-as-judge (MASJ), would work for multiple-choice question-answering tasks for different question topics. Our experiments consider three LLMs: Phi-4, Mistral, and Qwen of different sizes from 1.5B to 72B and $14$ topics. While MASJ performs similarly to a random error predictor, the response entropy predicts model error in knowledge-dependent domains and serves as an effective indicator of question difficulty: for biology ROC AUC is $0.73$. This correlation vanishes for the reasoning-dependent domain: for math questions ROC-AUC is $0.55$. More principally, we found out that the entropy measure required a reasoning amount. Thus, data-uncertainty related entropy should be integrated within uncertainty estimates frameworks, while MASJ requires refinement. Moreover, existing MMLU-Pro samples are biased, and should balance required amount of reasoning for different subdomains to provide a more fair assessment of LLMs performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kun Li, Tianhua Zhang, Yunxiang Li, Hongyin Luo, Abdalla Moustafa, Xixin Wu, James Glass, Helen Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving context faithfulness in large language models is essential for developing trustworthy retrieval augmented generation systems and mitigating hallucinations, especially in long-form question answering (LFQA) tasks or scenarios involving knowledge conflicts. Existing methods either intervene LLMs only at inference without addressing their inherent limitations or overlook the potential for self-improvement. In this paper, we introduce GenDiE (Generate, Discriminate, Evolve), a novel self-evolving framework that enhances context faithfulness through fine-grained sentence-level optimization. GenDiE combines both generative and discriminative training, equipping LLMs with self-generation and self-scoring capabilities to facilitate iterative self-evolution. This supports both data construction for model alignment and score-guided search during inference. Furthermore, by treating each sentence in a response as an independent optimization unit, GenDiE effectively addresses the limitations of previous approaches that optimize at the holistic answer level, which may miss unfaithful details. Experiments on ASQA (in-domain LFQA) and ConFiQA (out-of-domain counterfactual QA) datasets demonstrate that GenDiE surpasses various baselines in both faithfulness and correctness, and exhibits robust performance for domain adaptation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenxi Wang, Tianle Gu, Zhongyu Wei, Lang Gao, Zirui Song, Xiuying Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Human readers can efficiently comprehend scrambled words, a phenomenon known as Typoglycemia, primarily by relying on word form; if word form alone is insufficient, they further utilize contextual cues for interpretation. While advanced large language models (LLMs) exhibit similar abilities, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this, we conduct controlled experiments to analyze the roles of word form and contextual information in semantic reconstruction and examine LLM attention patterns. Specifically, we first propose SemRecScore, a reliable metric to quantify the degree of semantic reconstruction, and validate its effectiveness. Using this metric, we study how word form and contextual information influence LLMs' semantic reconstruction ability, identifying word form as the core factor in this process. Furthermore, we analyze how LLMs utilize word form and find that they rely on specialized attention heads to extract and process word form information, with this mechanism remaining stable across varying levels of word scrambling. This distinction between LLMs' fixed attention patterns primarily focused on word form and human readers' adaptive strategy in balancing word form and contextual information provides insights into enhancing LLM performance by incorporating human-like, context-aware mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryo Ueda, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Shunsuke Kando, Kentaro Inui</p>
<p>Abstract: What is a neural model with minimum architectural complexity that exhibits reasonable language learning capability? To explore such a simple but sufficient neural language model, we revisit a basic reservoir computing (RC) model, Echo State Network (ESN), a restricted class of simple Recurrent Neural Networks. Our experiments showed that ESN with a large hidden state is comparable or superior to Transformer in grammaticality judgment tasks when trained with about 100M words, suggesting that architectures as complex as that of Transformer may not always be necessary for syntactic learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alberto Purpura, Sahil Wadhwa, Jesse Zymet, Akshay Gupta, Andy Luo, Melissa Kazemi Rad, Swapnil Shinde, Mohammad Shahed Sorower</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant privacy, security, and ethical concerns. While much research has proposed methods for defending LLM systems against misuse by malicious actors, researchers have recently complemented these efforts with an offensive approach that involves red teaming, i.e., proactively attacking LLMs with the purpose of identifying their vulnerabilities. This paper provides a concise and practical overview of the LLM red teaming literature, structured so as to describe a multi-component system end-to-end. To motivate red teaming we survey the initial safety needs of some high-profile LLMs, and then dive into the different components of a red teaming system as well as software packages for implementing them. We cover various attack methods, strategies for attack-success evaluation, metrics for assessing experiment outcomes, as well as a host of other considerations. Our survey will be useful for any reader who wants to rapidly obtain a grasp of the major red teaming concepts for their own use in practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal, compact yet highly capable language and multimodal models. Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.</p>

Our model employs specialized Boolean experts, each tailored to amplify or suppress attention for operator-specific contexts. A predefined gating mechanism activates the corresponding experts based on the detected Boolean type.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengliang Shi, Yuhan Wang, Lingyong Yan, Pengjie Ren, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhaochun Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Tool learning aims to augment large language models (LLMs) with diverse tools, enabling them to act as agents for solving practical tasks. Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shiqi Chen, Tongyao Zhu, Ruochen Zhou, Jinghan Zhang, Siyang Gao, Juan Carlos Niebles, Mor Geva, Junxian He, Jiajun Wu, Manling Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have long struggled with spatial reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, even simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as recognizing "under" or "behind" relationships between only two objects, pose significant challenges for current VLMs. In this work, we study the spatial reasoning challenge from the lens of mechanistic interpretability, diving into the model's internal states to examine the interactions between image and text tokens. By tracing attention distribution over the image through out intermediate layers, we observe that successful spatial reasoning correlates strongly with the model's ability to align its attention distribution with actual object locations, particularly differing between familiar and unfamiliar spatial relationships. Motivated by these findings, we propose ADAPTVIS based on inference-time confidence scores to sharpen the attention on highly relevant regions when confident, while smoothing and broadening the attention window to consider a wider context when confidence is lower. This training-free decoding method shows significant improvement (e.g., up to a 50 absolute point improvement) on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as WhatsUp and VSR with negligible cost.

<p>Abstract: We investigate the robustness of reasoning models trained for step-by-step problem solving by introducing query-agnostic adversarial triggers - short, irrelevant text that, when appended to math problems, systematically mislead models to output incorrect answers without altering the problem's semantics. We propose CatAttack, an automated iterative attack pipeline for generating triggers on a weaker, less expensive proxy model (DeepSeek V3) and successfully transfer them to more advanced reasoning target models like DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek R1-distilled-Qwen-32B, resulting in greater than 300% increase in the likelihood of the target model generating an incorrect answer. For example, appending, "Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives," to any math problem leads to more than doubling the chances of a model getting the answer wrong. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in reasoning models, revealing that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to subtle adversarial inputs, raising security and reliability concerns.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Albinhassan, Pranava Madhyastha, Alessandra Russo</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring both syntactic and semantic correctness in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs remains a significant challenge, despite being critical for real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$, a unified approach that enforces rich context-sensitive constraints and task- and instance-specific semantics directly on an LLM decoder. Our approach integrates token-level MCTS, which is guided by specific syntactic and semantic constraints. The constraints over the desired outputs are expressed using Answer Set Grammars -- a logic-based formalism that generalizes context-sensitive grammars while incorporating background knowledge to represent task-specific semantics. We show that our approach guarantees correct completions for any off-the-shelf LLM without the need for fine-tuning. We evaluate $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$ on a range of tasks, including synthetic grammar synthesis, combinatorial reasoning, and planning. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$ allows small pre-trained LLMs to efficiently outperform larger variants and state-of-the-art reasoning models (e.g., o1-preview) while simultaneously guaranteeing solution correctness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamish Ivison, Muru Zhang, Faeze Brahman, Pang Wei Koh, Pradeep Dasigi</p>
<p>Abstract: Selecting high-quality training data from a larger pool is a crucial step when instruction-tuning language models, as carefully curated datasets often produce models that outperform those trained on much larger, noisier datasets. Automated data selection approaches for instruction-tuning are typically tested by selecting small datasets (roughly 10k samples) from small pools (100-200k samples). However, popular deployed instruction-tuned models often train on hundreds of thousands to millions of samples, subsampled from even larger data pools. We present a systematic study of how well data selection methods scale to these settings, selecting up to 2.5M samples from pools of up to 5.8M samples and evaluating across 7 diverse tasks. We show that many recently proposed methods fall short of random selection in this setting (while using more compute), and even decline in performance when given access to larger pools of data to select over. However, we find that a variant of representation-based data selection (RDS+), which uses weighted mean pooling of pretrained LM hidden states, consistently outperforms more complex methods across all settings tested -- all whilst being more compute-efficient. Our findings highlight that the scaling properties of proposed automated selection methods should be more closely examined.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimet Beyza Bozdag, Shuhaib Mehri, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs' susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, Persuader agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the Persuadee agents, allowing us to measure LLMs' persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Badr AlKhamissi, Greta Tuckute, Yingtian Tang, Taha Binhuraib, Antoine Bosselut, Martin Schrimpf</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable similarity to neural activity in the human language network. However, the key properties of language shaping brain-like representations, and their evolution during training as a function of different tasks remain unclear. We here benchmark 34 training checkpoints spanning 300B tokens across 8 different model sizes to analyze how brain alignment relates to linguistic competence. Specifically, we find that brain alignment tracks the development of formal linguistic competence -- i.e., knowledge of linguistic rules -- more closely than functional linguistic competence. While functional competence, which involves world knowledge and reasoning, continues to develop throughout training, its relationship with brain alignment is weaker, suggesting that the human language network primarily encodes formal linguistic structure rather than broader cognitive functions. We further show that model size is not a reliable predictor of brain alignment when controlling for feature size and find that the correlation between next-word prediction, behavioral alignment and brain alignment fades once models surpass human language proficiency. Finally, using the largest set of rigorous neural language benchmarks to date, we show that language brain alignment benchmarks remain unsaturated, highlighting opportunities for improving future models. Taken together, our findings suggest that the human language network is best modeled by formal, rather than functional, aspects of language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'e Jonasson</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on positional encodings to provide sequence position information to their attention mechanism. Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), which encode relative position by rotating queries and keys, have become widely used in modern LLMs. We study the features and patterns that emerge in queries and keys when using rotary embeddings. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns within the same model across layers and attention heads and across different models and architectures. We present and apply analysis techniques and show how the queries and keys use RoPE to construct various attention patterns, including attention sinks. We find and analyze outliers across models in queries and keys and find that they are likely to be found in rotary features with partial cycles. We derive bounds that tell us what rotary frequencies are likely to be selected as outlier features and at what minimum angle the query-key rotary pairs in these features tend to be above and verify the bounds empirically with models of significant architectural differences.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distilling advanced Large Language Models' instruction-following capabilities into smaller models using a selected subset has become a mainstream approach in model training. While existing synthetic instruction data selection strategies rely mainly on single-dimensional signals (i.e., reward scores, model perplexity), they fail to capture the complexity of instruction-following across diverse fields. Therefore, we investigate more diverse signals to capture comprehensive instruction-response pair characteristics and propose three foundational metrics that leverage Multi-LLM wisdom, informed by (1) diverse LLM responses and (2) reward model assessment. Building upon base metrics, we propose CrowdSelect, an integrated metric incorporating a clustering-based approach to maintain response diversity. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our foundation metrics consistently improve performance across 4 base models on MT-bench and Arena-Hard. CrowdSelect, efficiently incorporating all metrics, achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Full and LoRA fine-tuning, showing improvements of 4.81% on Arena-Hard and 11.1% on MT-bench with Llama-3.2-3b-instruct.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhui Li, Fangyun Wei, Chao Zhang, Hongyang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The sequential nature of modern LLMs makes them expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has proven to be an effective solution to this problem. Methods like EAGLE perform autoregression at the feature level, reusing top-layer features from the target model to achieve better results than vanilla speculative sampling. A growing trend in the LLM community is scaling up training data to improve model intelligence without increasing inference costs. However, we observe that scaling up data provides limited improvements for EAGLE. We identify that this limitation arises from EAGLE's feature prediction constraints. In this paper, we introduce EAGLE-3, which abandons feature prediction in favor of direct token prediction and replaces reliance on top-layer features with multi-layer feature fusion via a technique named training-time test. These improvements significantly enhance performance and enable the draft model to fully benefit from scaling up training data. Our experiments include both chat models and reasoning models, evaluated on five tasks. The results show that EAGLE-3 achieves a speedup ratio up to 6.5x, with about 1.4x improvement over EAGLE-2.

<p>Abstract: The increasing integration of large language model (LLM) based conversational agents into everyday life raises critical cognitive and social questions about their potential to influence human opinions. Although previous studies have shown that LLM-based agents can generate persuasive content, these typically involve controlled, English-language settings. Addressing this, our preregistered study explored LLM's persuasive capabilities in more ecological, unconstrained scenarios, examining both static (written paragraphs) and dynamic (conversations via Telegram) interaction types. Conducted entirely in Hebrew with 200 participants, the study assessed the persuasive effects of both LLM and human interlocutors on controversial civil policy topics. Results indicated that participants adopted LLM and human perspectives similarly, with significant opinion changes evident across all conditions, regardless of interlocutor type or interaction mode. Confidence levels increased significantly in most scenarios, except in static LLM interactions. These findings demonstrate LLM-based agents' robust persuasive capabilities across diverse sources and settings, highlighting their potential impact on shaping public opinions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly woven into individuals' personal lives, yet users often underestimate the privacy risks involved. The moment users share information with these agents (e.g., LLMs), their private information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLMs. It aims to minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended goals when interacting with LLMs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative design user study, we observe how even "privacy-conscious" users inadvertently reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights from this study, we propose a locally-deployable framework that operates between users and LLMs, and identifies and reformulates out-of-context information in user prompts. Our evaluation using examples from ShareGPT shows that lightweight models can effectively implement this framework, achieving strong gains in contextual privacy while preserving the user's intended interaction goals through different approaches to classify information relevant to the intended goals.</p>

To further advance the design of complex engineering solutions, we propose a novel system, SolutionRAG, that leverages the tree-based exploration and bi-point thinking mechanism to generate reliable solutions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SolutionRAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the SolutionBench, highlighting its potential to enhance the automation and reliability of complex engineering solution design in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengsong Huang, Langlin Huang, Jixuan Leng, Jiacheng Liu, Jiaxin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Increasing test-time computation is a straightforward approach to enhancing the quality of responses in Large Language Models (LLMs). While Best-of-N sampling and Self-Consistency with majority voting are simple and effective, they require a fixed number of sampling responses for each query, regardless of its complexity. This could result in wasted computation for simpler questions and insufficient exploration for more challenging ones. In this work, we argue that model confidence of responses can be used for improving the efficiency of test-time scaling. Unfortunately, LLMs are known to be overconfident and provide unreliable confidence estimation. To address this limitation, we introduce Self-Calibration by distilling Self-Consistency-derived confidence into the model itself. This enables reliable confidence estimation at test time with one forward pass. We then design confidence-based efficient test-time scaling methods to handle queries of various difficulty, such as Early-Stopping for Best-of-N and Self-Consistency with calibrated confidence. Experiments on three LLMs across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, applying confidence-based Early Stopping to Best-of-N improves MathQA accuracy from 81.0 to 83.6 with a sample budget of 16 responses, indicating the efficacy of confidence-based sampling strategy at inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nilay Yilmaz, Maitreya Patel, Yiran Lawrence Luo, Tejas Gokhale, Chitta Baral, Suren Jayasuriya, Yezhou Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a powerful tool for integrating visual and textual information. Despite their exceptional performance on visual understanding benchmarks, measuring their ability to reason abstractly across multiple images remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce VOILA, a large-scale, open-ended, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' perceptual understanding and abstract relational reasoning. VOILA employs an analogical mapping approach in the visual domain, requiring models to generate an image that completes an analogy between two given image pairs, reference and application, without relying on predefined choices. Our experiments demonstrate that the analogical reasoning tasks in VOILA present a challenge to MLLMs. Through multi-step analysis, we reveal that current MLLMs struggle to comprehend inter-image relationships and exhibit limited capabilities in high-level relational reasoning. Notably, we observe that performance improves when following a multi-step strategy of least-to-most prompting. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source models and GPT-4o show that on text-based answers, the best accuracy for challenging scenarios is 13% (LLaMa 3.2) and even for simpler tasks is only 29% (GPT-4o), while human performance is significantly higher at 70% across both difficulty levels.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ranjan Sapkota, Manoj Karkee</p>
<p>Abstract: This study evaluated the performance of the YOLOv12 object detection model, and compared against YOLOv11 and YOLOv10 for apple detection in commercial orchards using synthetic images generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The YOLOv12n configuration excelled, achieving the highest precision at 0.916, the highest recall at 0.969, and the highest mean Average Precision (mAP@50) at 0.978. In comparison, the YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which recorded the highest precision at 0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and YOLOv10l tied for the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving the highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. The study also highlighted efficiency in processing speeds, where YOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's 5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new in more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, the YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO algorithm among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on high-quality LLM-generated datasets, not only surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics but also offered a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the field.</p>

Lillicrap, Ana Marasovi\'c, Sylvie Delacroix, Gillian K. Hadfield, Siva Reddy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on producing responses that meet human expectations and align with shared values - a process coined alignment. However, aligning LLMs remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between the complexity of human values and the narrow nature of the technological approaches designed to address them. Current alignment methods often lead to misspecified objectives, reflecting the broader issue of incomplete contracts, the impracticality of specifying a contract between a model developer, and the model that accounts for every scenario in LLM alignment. In this paper, we argue that improving LLM alignment requires incorporating insights from societal alignment frameworks, including social, economic, and contractual alignment, and discuss potential solutions drawn from these domains. Given the role of uncertainty within societal alignment frameworks, we then investigate how it manifests in LLM alignment. We end our discussion by offering an alternative view on LLM alignment, framing the underspecified nature of its objectives as an opportunity rather than perfect their specification. Beyond technical improvements in LLM alignment, we discuss the need for participatory alignment interface designs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Esam Ghaleb, Bulat Khaertdinov, Asl{\i} \"Ozy\"urek, Raquel Fern\'andez</p>
<p>Abstract: In face-to-face interaction, we use multiple modalities, including speech and gestures, to communicate information and resolve references to objects. However, how representational co-speech gestures refer to objects remains understudied from a computational perspective. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal reference resolution task centred on representational gestures, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of learning robust gesture embeddings. We propose a self-supervised pre-training approach to gesture representation learning that grounds body movements in spoken language. Our experiments show that the learned embeddings align with expert annotations and have significant predictive power. Moreover, reference resolution accuracy further improves when (1) using multimodal gesture representations, even when speech is unavailable at inference time, and (2) leveraging dialogue history. Overall, our findings highlight the complementary roles of gesture and speech in reference resolution, offering a step towards more naturalistic models of human-machine interaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce InspireMusic, a framework integrated super resolution and large language model for high-fidelity long-form music generation. A unified framework generates high-fidelity music, songs, and audio, which incorporates an autoregressive transformer with a super-resolution flow-matching model. This framework enables the controllable generation of high-fidelity long-form music at a higher sampling rate from both text and audio prompts. Our model differs from previous approaches, as we utilize an audio tokenizer with one codebook that contains richer semantic information, thereby reducing training costs and enhancing efficiency. This combination enables us to achieve high-quality audio generation with long-form coherence of up to $8$ minutes. Then, an autoregressive transformer model based on Qwen 2.5 predicts audio tokens. Next, we employ a super-resolution flow-matching model to generate high-sampling rate audio with fine-grained details learned from an acoustic codec model. Comprehensive experiments show that the InspireMusic-1.5B-Long model has a comparable performance to recent top-tier open-source systems, including MusicGen and Stable Audio 2.0, on subjective and objective evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kangda Wei, Zhengyu Zhou, Bingqing Wang, Jun Araki, Lukas Lange, Ruihong Huang, Zhe Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, online lecture videos have become an increasingly popular resource for acquiring new knowledge. Systems capable of effectively understanding/indexing lecture videos are thus highly desirable, enabling downstream tasks like question answering to help users efficiently locate specific information within videos. This work proposes PreMind, a novel multi-agent multimodal framework that leverages various large models for advanced understanding/indexing of presentation-style videos. PreMind first segments videos into slide-presentation segments using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance modern shot-detection techniques. Each segment is then analyzed to generate multimodal indexes through three key steps: (1) extracting slide visual content, (2) transcribing speech narratives, and (3) consolidating these visual and speech contents into an integrated understanding. Three innovative mechanisms are also proposed to improve performance: leveraging prior lecture knowledge to refine visual understanding, detecting/correcting speech transcription errors using a VLM, and utilizing a critic agent for dynamic iterative self-reflection in vision analysis. Compared to traditional video indexing methods, PreMind captures rich, reliable multimodal information, allowing users to search for details like abbreviations shown only on slides. Systematic evaluations on the public LPM dataset and an internal enterprise dataset are conducted to validate PreMind's effectiveness, supported by detailed analyses.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lili Lu, Chuan Meng, Federico Ravenda, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Fabio Crestani</p>
<p>Abstract: Clarification need prediction (CNP) is a key task in conversational search, aiming to predict whether to ask a clarifying question or give an answer to the current user query. However, current research on CNP suffers from the issues of limited CNP training data and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot and efficient CNP framework (Zef-CNP), in which we first prompt large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot manner to generate two sets of synthetic queries: ambiguous and specific (unambiguous) queries. We then use the generated queries to train efficient CNP models. Zef-CNP eliminates the need for human-annotated clarification-need labels during training and avoids the use of LLMs with high query latency at query time. To further improve the generation quality of synthetic queries, we devise a topic-, information-need-, and query-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy (TIQ-CoT). Moreover, we enhance TIQ-CoT with counterfactual query generation (CoQu), which guides LLMs first to generate a specific/ambiguous query and then sequentially generate its corresponding ambiguous/specific query. Experimental results show that Zef-CNP achieves superior CNP effectiveness and efficiency compared with zero- and few-shot LLM-based CNP predictors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Expert (MoE) models are popular foundational architectures at large scale, however, under-explored at smaller sizes. Here, we show how to enable Compact Sparse Mixture of Experts (CoSMoEs) for on-device inference. Specifically, we tackle the three main on-device dimensions: Quality, Memory and Latency. Along the quality axis, we show that in a fair evaluation (removing confounding factors) MoE architectures outperform FLOP-aligned dense models at on-device scale. We introduce weight-decomposed experts, further improving the MoE model performance. Regarding model memory and latency, we significantly improve model offloading efficiency and, in turn, reduce model inference latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jahan C. Penny-Dimri, Magdalena Bachmann, William R. Cooke, Sam Mathewlynn, Samuel Dockree, John Tolladay, Jannik Kossen, Lin Li, Yarin Gal, Gabriel Davis Jones</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold substantial promise for clinical decision support. However, their widespread adoption in medicine, particularly in healthcare, is hindered by their propensity to generate false or misleading outputs, known as hallucinations. In high-stakes domains such as women's health (obstetrics & gynaecology), where errors in clinical reasoning can have profound consequences for maternal and neonatal outcomes, ensuring the reliability of AI-generated responses is critical. Traditional methods for quantifying uncertainty, such as perplexity, fail to capture meaning-level inconsistencies that lead to misinformation. Here, we evaluate semantic entropy (SE), a novel uncertainty metric that assesses meaning-level variation, to detect hallucinations in AI-generated medical content. Using a clinically validated dataset derived from UK RCOG MRCOG examinations, we compared SE with perplexity in identifying uncertain responses. SE demonstrated superior performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.75-0.78), compared to 0.62 (0.60-0.65) for perplexity. Clinical expert validation further confirmed its effectiveness, with SE achieving near-perfect uncertainty discrimination (AUROC: 0.97). While semantic clustering was successful in only 30% of cases, SE remains a valuable tool for improving AI safety in women's health. These findings suggest that SE could enable more reliable AI integration into clinical practice, particularly in resource-limited settings where LLMs could augment care. This study highlights the potential of SE as a key safeguard in the responsible deployment of AI-driven tools in women's health, leading to safer and more effective digital health interventions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) communities, especially those featuring multimodal content, improve user experiences by integrating visual and textual information into results (or items). The challenge of improving user experiences in complex systems with search and recommendation (S\&R) services has drawn significant attention from both academia and industry these years. However, the lack of high-quality datasets has limited the research progress on multimodal S\&R. To address the growing need for developing better S\&R services, we present a novel multimodal information retrieval dataset in this paper, namely Qilin. The dataset is collected from Xiaohongshu, a popular social platform with over 300 million monthly active users and an average search penetration rate of over 70\%. In contrast to existing datasets, \textsf{Qilin} offers a comprehensive collection of user sessions with heterogeneous results like image-text notes, video notes, commercial notes, and direct answers, facilitating the development of advanced multimodal neural retrieval models across diverse task settings. To better model user satisfaction and support the analysis of heterogeneous user behaviors, we also collect extensive APP-level contextual signals and genuine user feedback. Notably, Qilin contains user-favored answers and their referred results for search requests triggering the Deep Query Answering (DQA) module. This allows not only the training \& evaluation of a Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, but also the exploration of how such a module would affect users' search behavior. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, we provide interesting findings and insights for further improving S\&R systems. We hope that \textsf{Qilin} will significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal content platforms with S\&R services in the future.</p>

<p>Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander W. Lee, Justin Chan, Michael Fu, Nicolas Kim, Akshay Mehta, Deepti Raghavan, Ugur Cetintemel</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of AI-augmented Data Processing Systems (DPSs) has introduced powerful semantic operators that extend traditional data management capabilities with LLM-based processing. However, these systems face fundamental reliability (a.k.a. trust) challenges, as LLMs can generate erroneous outputs, limiting their adoption in critical domains. Existing approaches to LLM constraints--ranging from user-defined functions to constrained decoding--are fragmented, imperative, and lack semantics-aware integration into query execution. To address this gap, we introduce Semantic Integrity Constraints (SICs), a novel declarative abstraction that extends traditional database integrity constraints to govern and optimize semantic operators within DPSs. SICs integrate seamlessly into the relational model, allowing users to specify common classes of constraints (e.g., grounding and soundness) while enabling query-aware enforcement and optimization strategies.
  In this paper, we present the core design of SICs, describe their formal integration into query execution, and detail our conception of grounding constraints, a key SIC class that ensures factual consistency of generated outputs. In addition, we explore novel enforcement mechanisms, combining proactive (constrained decoding) and reactive (validation and recovery) techniques to optimize efficiency and reliability. Our work establishes SICs as a foundational framework for trustworthy, high-performance AI-augmented data processing, paving the way for future research in constraint-driven optimizations, adaptive enforcement, and enterprise-scale deployments.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00612">Statistical Mechanics of Semantic Compression</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Tankut Can</p>
<p>Abstract: The basic problem of semantic compression is to minimize the length of a message while preserving its meaning. This differs from classical notions of compression in that the distortion is not measured directly at the level of bits, but rather in an abstract semantic space. In order to make this precise, we take inspiration from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning and model semantic space as a continuous Euclidean vector space. In such a space, stimuli like speech, images, or even ideas, are mapped to high-dimensional real vectors, and the location of these embeddings determines their meaning relative to other embeddings. This suggests that a natural metric for semantic similarity is just the Euclidean distance, which is what we use in this work. We map the optimization problem of determining the minimal-length, meaning-preserving message to a spin glass Hamiltonian and solve the resulting statistical mechanics problem using replica theory. We map out the replica symmetric phase diagram, identifying distinct phases of semantic compression: a first-order transition occurs between lossy and lossless compression, whereas a continuous crossover is seen from extractive to abstractive compression. We conclude by showing numerical simulations of compressions obtained by simulated annealing and greedy algorithms, and argue that while the problem of finding a meaning-preserving compression is computationally hard in the worst case, there exist efficient algorithms which achieve near optimal performance in the typical case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seonghyeon Lee, Heejae Chon, Joonwon Jang, Dongha Lee, Hwanjo Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models (LMs) have exhibited impressive abilities in generating code from natural language requirements. In this work, we highlight the diversity of code generated by LMs as a critical criterion for evaluating their code generation capabilities. There is a lack of studies focused on assessing the diversity of generated code, which overlooks its importance in code LMs. Therefore, we propose a systematic approach to evaluate code diversity, introducing various metrics with inter-code similarity. Specifically, we introduce code clustering methods that leverages LMs' capabilities in code understanding and reasoning, resulting in a set of metrics that represent the number of algorithms in model-generated solutions. We extensively investigate the property of model-generated solutions by contrasting them with human-written ones and quantifying the impact of various factors on code diversity: model size, temperature, instruction tuning, and problem complexity. Our analysis demonstrates that model-generated solutions exhibit low algorithmic diversity, which was neglected by the research community. Moreover, we explore methods to increase code diversity by combining solutions from different models and increasing sampling temperatures. Our findings highlight that code diversity can be enhanced with the help of heterogeneous models and setting temperature beyond 1.0 that has not been fully explored due to the functional correctness degradation. To facilitate our research direction, we publicly share our code and datasets through open-source repositories.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiqi Bu, Ruixuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a privacy-preserving paradigm that protects the training data when training deep learning models. Critically, the performance of models is determined by the training hyperparameters, especially those of the learning rate schedule, thus requiring fine-grained hyperparameter tuning on the data. In practice, it is common to tune the learning rate hyperparameters through the grid search that (1) is computationally expensive as multiple runs are needed, and (2) increases the risk of data leakage as the selection of hyperparameters is data-dependent. In this work, we adapt the automatic learning rate schedule to DP optimization for any models and optimizers, so as to significantly mitigate or even eliminate the cost of hyperparameter tuning when applied together with automatic per-sample gradient clipping. Our hyperparameter-free DP optimization is almost as computationally efficient as the standard non-DP optimization, and achieves state-of-the-art DP performance on various language and vision tasks.</p>

Based on a simple econometric framework in which text may capture outcomes of interest, our procedure addresses three questions: First, is the text affected by the treatment? Second, which outcomes is the effect on? And third, how complete is our description of causal effects? To answer all three questions, our approach uses large language models (LLMs) that suggest systematic differences across two groups of text documents and then provides valid inference based on costly validation. Specifically, we highlight the need for sample splitting to allow for statistical validation of LLM outputs, as well as the need for human labeling to validate substantive claims about how documents differ across groups. We illustrate the tool in a proof-of-concept application using abstracts of academic manuscripts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Pre-training and representation learning have been playing an increasingly important role in modern speech processing. Nevertheless, different applications have been relying on different foundation models, since predominant pre-training techniques are either designed for discriminative tasks or generative tasks. In this work, we make the first attempt at building a unified pre-training framework for both types of tasks in speech. We show that with the appropriate design choices for pre-training, one can jointly learn a representation encoder and generative audio decoder that can be applied to both types of tasks. We propose UniWav, an encoder-decoder framework designed to unify pre-training representation learning and generative tasks. On speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech tokenization, UniWav achieves comparable performance to different existing foundation models, each trained on a specific task. Our findings suggest that a single general-purpose foundation model for speech can be built to replace different foundation models, reducing the overhead and cost of pre-training.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we leverage psychological methods to investigate LLMs' conceptual mastery in applying rules. We introduce a novel procedure to match the diversity of thought generated by LLMs to that observed in a human sample. We then conducted two experiments comparing rule-based decision-making in humans and LLMs. Study 1 found that all investigated LLMs replicated human patterns regardless of whether they are prompted with scenarios created before or after their training cut-off. Moreover, we found unanticipated differences between the two sets of scenarios among humans. Surprisingly, even these differences were replicated in LLM responses. Study 2 turned to a contextual feature of human rule application: under forced time delay, human samples rely more heavily on a rule's text than on other considerations such as a rule's purpose.. Our results revealed that some models (Gemini Pro and Claude 3) responded in a human-like manner to a prompt describing either forced delay or time pressure, while others (GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 90b) did not. We argue that the evidence gathered suggests that LLMs have mastery over the concept of rule, with implications for both legal decision making and philosophical inquiry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhairya Dalal, Sharmi Dev Gupta, Bentolhoda Binaei</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a unsupervised semantic search pipeline for the Causality-driven Adhoc Information Retrieval (CAIR-2021) shared task. The CAIR shared task expands traditional information retrieval to support the retrieval of documents containing the likely causes of a query event. A successful system must be able to distinguish between topical documents and documents containing causal descriptions of events that are causally related to the query event. Our approach involves aggregating results from multiple query strategies over a semantic and lexical index. The proposed approach leads the CAIR-2021 leaderboard and outperformed both traditional IR and pure semantic embedding-based approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Xie, Yueqi Xie</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, will increasingly replace humans in producing output for a variety of important tasks. While much prior work has mostly focused on the improvement in the average performance of generative AI models relative to humans' performance, much less attention has been paid to the significant reduction of variance in output produced by generative AI models. In this Perspective, we demonstrate that generative AI models are inherently prone to the phenomenon of "regression toward the mean" whereby variance in output tends to shrink relative to that in real-world distributions. We discuss potential social implications of this phenomenon across three levels-societal, group, and individual-and two dimensions-material and non-material. Finally, we discuss interventions to mitigate negative effects, considering the roles of both service providers and users. Overall, this Perspective aims to raise awareness of the importance of output variance in generative AI and to foster collaborative efforts to meet the challenges posed by the reduction of variance in output generated by AI models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuyang Huang, Yuhan Liu, Haryadi S. Gunawi, Beibin Li, Changho Hwang</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning has emerged as a promising solution to refine models incrementally by leveraging user feedback, thereby enhancing model performance in applications like code completion, personal assistants, and chat interfaces. In particular, online continual learning - iteratively training the model with small batches of user feedback - has demonstrated notable performance improvements. However, the existing practice of segregating training and serving processes forces the online trainer to recompute the intermediate results already done during serving. Such redundant computations can account for 30%-42% of total training time.
  In this paper, we propose Alchemist, to the best of our knowledge, the first online continual learning system that efficiently reuses intermediate results computed during serving to reduce redundant computation with minimal impact on the serving latency or capacity. Alchemist introduces two key techniques: (1) minimal activations recording and saving during serving, where activations are recorded and saved only during the prefill phase to minimize overhead; and (2) offloading of serving activations, which dynamically manages GPU memory by freeing activations in the forward order, while reloading them in the backward order during the backward pass. Evaluations with the ShareGPT dataset show that compared with a separate training cluster, Alchemist significantly increases training throughput by up to 1.72x, reduces up to 47% memory usage during training, and supports up to 2x more training tokens - all while maintaining negligible impact on serving latency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zaoyu Chen, Haoran Qin, Nuo Chen, Xiangyu Zhao, Lei Xue, Xiapu Luo, Xiao-Ming Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart contracts are crucial programs on blockchains, and their immutability post-deployment makes functional correctness vital. Despite progress in code completion models, benchmarks for Solidity, the primary smart contract language, are lacking. Existing metrics like BLEU do not adequately assess the functional correctness of generated smart contracts. To fill this gap, we introduce SolBench, a benchmark for evaluating the functional correctness of Solidity smart contracts generated by code completion models. SolBench includes 4,178 functions from 1,155 Ethereum-deployed contracts. Testing advanced models revealed challenges in generating correct code without context, as Solidity functions rely on context-defined variables and interfaces. To address this, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Code Repair framework. In this framework, an executor verifies functional correctness, and if necessary, an LLM repairs the code using retrieved snippets informed by executor traces. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs across various model sizes and series to assess their performance in smart contract completion. The results show that code repair and retrieval techniques effectively enhance the correctness of smart contract completion while reducing computational costs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rin Ashizawa, Yoichi Hirose, Nozomu Yoshinari, Kento Uchida, Shinichi Shirakawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to search for effective prompts that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). Although existing prompt optimization methods have discovered effective prompts, they often differ from sophisticated prompts carefully designed by human experts. Prompt design strategies, representing best practices for improving prompt performance, can be key to improving prompt optimization. Recently, a method termed the Autonomous Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) has incorporated various prompt design strategies into the prompt optimization process. In APET, the LLM is needed to implicitly select and apply the appropriate strategies because prompt design strategies can have negative effects. This implicit selection may be suboptimal due to the limited optimization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces Optimizing Prompts with sTrategy Selection (OPTS), which implements explicit selection mechanisms for prompt design. We propose three mechanisms, including a Thompson sampling-based approach, and integrate them into EvoPrompt, a well-known prompt optimizer. Experiments optimizing prompts for two LLMs, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o mini, were conducted using BIG-Bench Hard. Our results show that the selection of prompt design strategies improves the performance of EvoPrompt, and the Thompson sampling-based mechanism achieves the best overall results.

<p>Abstract: Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on various vision-language tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite accumulating evidence of privacy concerns associated with task-relevant content, it remains unclear whether MLLMs inadvertently memorize private content that is entirely irrelevant to the training tasks. In this paper, we investigate how randomly generated task-irrelevant private content can become spuriously correlated with downstream objectives due to partial mini-batch training dynamics, thus causing inadvertent memorization. Concretely, we randomly generate task-irrelevant watermarks into VQA fine-tuning images at varying probabilities and propose a novel probing framework to determine whether MLLMs have inadvertently encoded such content. Our experiments reveal that MLLMs exhibit notably different training behaviors in partial mini-batch settings with task-irrelevant watermarks embedded. Furthermore, through layer-wise probing, we demonstrate that MLLMs trigger distinct representational patterns when encountering previously seen task-irrelevant knowledge, even if this knowledge does not influence their output during prompting.

<p>Abstract: High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research is a fundamental process driving the advancement of human civilization, yet it demands substantial time and effort from researchers. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has inspired researchers to explore how AI can accelerate and enhance research. To monitor relevant advancements, this paper presents a systematic review of the progress in this domain. Specifically, we organize the relevant studies into three main categories: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication. Hypothesis formulation involves knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation. Hypothesis validation includes the verification of scientific claims, theorem proving, and experiment validation. Manuscript publication encompasses manuscript writing and the peer review process. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the current challenges faced in these areas, as well as potential future directions for research. Finally, we also offer a comprehensive overview of existing benchmarks and tools across various domains that support the integration of AI into the research process.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pankaj Choudhury, Yogesh Aggarwal, Prithwijit Guha, Sukumar Nandi</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks have significantly advanced AI applications, yet their real-world adoption remains constrained by high computational demands, hardware limitations, and accessibility challenges. In image captioning, many state-of-the-art models have achieved impressive performances while relying on resource-intensive architectures. This made them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This limitation is particularly noticeable for applications involving low-resource languages. We demonstrate the case of image captioning in Assamese language, where lack of effective, scalable systems can restrict the accessibility of AI-based solutions for native Assamese speakers. This work presents AC-Lite, a computationally efficient model for image captioning in low-resource Assamese language. AC-Lite reduces computational requirements by replacing computation-heavy visual feature extractors like FasterRCNN with lightweight ShuffleNetv2x1.5. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are used as the caption decoder to further reduce computational demands and model parameters. Furthermore, the integration of bilinear attention enhances the model's overall performance. AC-Lite can operate on edge devices, thereby eliminating the need for computation on remote servers. The proposed AC-Lite model achieves 82.3 CIDEr score on the COCO-AC dataset with 1.098 GFLOPs and 25.65M parameters.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models(LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute and generating long Chain-of-Thought(CoT). Distillation--post-training on LRMs-generated data--is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models, but faces a critical bottleneck: we found that distilled long CoT data poses learning difficulty for small models and leads to the inheritance of biases (i.e. over-thinking) when using Supervised Fine-tuning(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning(RL) methods. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose constructing tree-based CoT data from scratch via Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS). We then exploit a set of CoT-aware approaches, including Thoughts Length Balance, Fine-grained DPO, and Joint Post-training Objective, to enhance SFT and RL on the construted data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilad Yehudai, Noah Amsel, Joan Bruna</p>
<p>Abstract: We study and compare the expressive power of transformers, RNNs, and transformers with chain of thought tokens on a simple and natural class of problems we term Compositional Reasoning Questions (CRQ). This family captures problems like evaluating Boolean formulas and multi-step word problems. Assuming standard hardness assumptions from circuit complexity and communication complexity, we prove that none of these three architectures is capable of solving CRQs unless some hyperparameter (depth, embedding dimension, and number of chain of thought tokens, respectively) grows with the size of the input. We also provide a construction for each architecture that solves CRQs. For transformers, our construction uses depth that is logarithmic in the problem size. For RNNs, logarithmic embedding dimension is necessary and sufficient, so long as the inputs are provided in a certain order. (Otherwise, a linear dimension is necessary). For transformers with chain of thought, our construction uses $n$ CoT tokens. These results show that, while CRQs are inherently hard, there are several different ways for language models to overcome this hardness. Even for a single class of problems, each architecture has strengths and weaknesses, and none is strictly better than the others.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multiple-choice exam questions with "None of the above" (NA) options have been extensively studied in educational testing, in which existing research suggests that they better assess true knowledge. However, their impact on Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluation remains underexplored. Through systematic experiments with 28 LLMs on the MMLU benchmark, we examine how NA options affect model performance and confidence calibration. Our analysis reveals that NA options, when used as the correct answer, lead to a consistent 30-50\% performance drop across models regardless of scale--suggesting that LLMs lack the meta-cognitive ability to systematically evaluate and reject all given options when none are correct. This degradation shows strong domain dependence, with minimal impact on mathematical reasoning (14.6\% drop) but severe effects on tasks requiring uncertainty handling like business ethics (48.1\% drop). Our results highlight important implications for benchmark design and raise questions about LLMs' ability to handle uncertainty in real-world applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhao Zhou, Sirui Song, Boyang Liu, Zhiheng Xi, Senjie Jin, Xiaoran Fan, Zhihao Zhang, Wei Li, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) enables each attention head to capture multi-frequency information along the sequence dimension and is widely applied in foundation models. However, the nonlinearity introduced by RoPE complicates optimization of the key state in the Key-Value (KV) cache for RoPE-based attention. Existing KV cache compression methods typically store key state before rotation and apply the transformation during decoding, introducing additional computational overhead. This paper introduces EliteKV, a flexible modification framework for RoPE-based models supporting variable KV cache compression ratios. EliteKV first identifies the intrinsic frequency preference of each head using RoPElite, selectively restoring linearity to certain dimensions of key within attention computation. Building on this, joint low-rank compression of key and value enables partial cache sharing. Experimental results show that with minimal uptraining on only $0.6\%$ of the original training data, RoPE-based models achieve a $75\%$ reduction in KV cache size while preserving performance within a negligible margin. Furthermore, EliteKV consistently performs well across models of different scales within the same family.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Ge, Yashu Liu, Jieping Ye, Tianyi Li, Chao Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern front-end (FE) development, especially when leveraging the unique features of frameworks like React and Vue, presents distinctive challenges. These include managing modular architectures, ensuring synchronization between data and visual outputs for declarative rendering, and adapting reusable components to various scenarios. Such complexities make it particularly difficult for state-of-the-art large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate accurate and functional code directly from design images. To address these challenges, we propose a reflective agentic workflow that synthesizes high-quality image-text data to capture the diverse characteristics of FE development. This workflow automates the extraction of self-contained\footnote{A \textbf{self-contained} code snippet is one that encapsulates all necessary logic, styling, and dependencies, ensuring it functions independently without requiring external imports or context.} code snippets from real-world projects, renders the corresponding visual outputs, and generates detailed descriptions that link design elements to functional code. To further expand the scope and utility of the synthesis, we introduce three data synthesis strategies: Evolution-based synthesis, which enables scalable and diverse dataset expansion; Waterfall-Model-based synthesis, which generates logically coherent code derived from system requirements; and Additive Development synthesis, which iteratively increases the complexity of human-authored components. We build a large vision-language model, Flame, trained on the synthesized datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating React code via the $\text{pass}@k$ metric. Our results suggest that a code VLM trained to interpret images before code generation may achieve better performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Hartmann, Amin Oueslati, Dimitri Staufer, Lena Pohlmann, Simon Munzert, Hendrik Heuer</p>
<p>Abstract: Commercial content moderation APIs are marketed as scalable solutions to combat online hate speech. However, the reliance on these APIs risks both silencing legitimate speech, called over-moderation, and failing to protect online platforms from harmful speech, known as under-moderation. To assess such risks, this paper introduces a framework for auditing black-box NLP systems. Using the framework, we systematically evaluate five widely used commercial content moderation APIs. Analyzing five million queries based on four datasets, we find that APIs frequently rely on group identity terms, such as ``black'', to predict hate speech. While OpenAI's and Amazon's services perform slightly better, all providers under-moderate implicit hate speech, which uses codified messages, especially against LGBTQIA+ individuals. Simultaneously, they over-moderate counter-speech, reclaimed slurs and content related to Black, LGBTQIA+, Jewish, and Muslim people. We recommend that API providers offer better guidance on API implementation and threshold setting and more transparency on their APIs' limitations.
  Warning: This paper contains offensive and hateful terms and concepts. We have chosen to reproduce these terms for reasons of transparency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Justin N. Kreikemeyer, Mi{\l}osz Jankowski, Pia Wilsdorf, Adelinde M. Uhrmacher</p>
<p>Abstract: Formal languages are an integral part of modeling and simulation. They allow the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to automatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language, which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into simulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like the commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this gap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned to translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-, and memory efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation model in up to 84.5% of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study demonstrates the model's practical potential for one-time generation as well as interactive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form, the fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that higher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and open-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchao Chen, Yilun Hao, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have shown great potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robot task and motion planning (TAMP). Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weicong Qin, Yi Xu, Weijie Yu, Chenglei Shen, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized product search aims to retrieve and rank items that match users' preferences and search intent. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Scialanga, Thibault Laugel, Vincent Grari, Marcin Detyniecki</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Langue Models have been shown to memorize real-world facts, the need to update this knowledge in a controlled and efficient manner arises. Designed with these constraints in mind, Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches propose to alter specific facts in pretrained models. However, they have been shown to suffer from several limitations, including their lack of contextual robustness and their failure to generalize to logical implications related to the fact. To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilad Yehudai, Clayton Sanford, Maya Bechler-Speicher, Orr Fischer, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Amir Globerson</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized the field of machine learning. In particular, they can be used to solve complex algorithmic problems, including graph-based tasks. In such algorithmic tasks a key question is what is the minimal size of a transformer that can implement a task. Recent work has begun to explore this problem for graph-based tasks, showing that for sub-linear embedding dimension (i.e., model width) logarithmic depth suffices. However, an open question, which we address here, is what happens if width is allowed to grow linearly. Here we analyze this setting, and provide the surprising result that with linear width, constant depth suffices for solving a host of graph-based problems. This suggests that a moderate increase in width can allow much shallower models, which are advantageous in terms of inference time. For other problems, we show that quadratic width is required. Our results demonstrate the complex and intriguing landscape of transformer implementations of graph-based algorithms. We support our theoretical results with empirical evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhi Zhang, Liangwei Yang, Wooseong Yang, Henry Peng Zou, Yuqing Liu, Ke Xu, Sourav Medya, Philip S. Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaborative filtering models, particularly graph-based approaches, have demonstrated strong performance in capturing user-item interactions for recommendation systems. However, they continue to struggle in cold-start and data-sparse scenarios. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT and LLaMA presents new possibilities for enhancing recommendation performance, especially in cold-start settings. Despite their promise, LLMs pose challenges related to scalability and efficiency due to their high computational demands and limited ability to model complex user-item relationships effectively. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on leveraging LLMs for CF model initialization. Through experiments, we uncover an embedding collapse issue when scaling CF models to larger embedding dimensions. To effectively harness large-scale LLM embeddings, we propose innovative selective initialization strategies utilizing random, uniform, and variance-based index sampling. Our comprehensive evaluation on multiple real-world datasets demonstrates significant performance gains across various CF models while maintaining a lower computational cost compared to existing LLM-based recommendation approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yi-Lin Sung, Prateek Yadav, Jialu Li, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Layer-wise quantization is a key technique for efficiently compressing large models without expensive retraining. Previous methods typically quantize the weights of each layer by "uniformly" optimizing the layer reconstruction loss across all output tokens. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that better-quantized models can be obtained by prioritizing learning from important tokens (e.g. which have large attention scores). Building on this finding, we propose RSQ (Rotate, Scale, then Quantize), which (1) applies rotations (orthogonal transformation) to the model to mitigate outliers (those with exceptionally large magnitude), (2) scales the token feature based on its importance, and (3) quantizes the model using the GPTQ framework with the second-order statistics computed by scaled tokens. To compute token importance, we explore both heuristic and dynamic strategies. Based on a thorough analysis of all approaches, we adopt attention concentration, which uses attention scores of each token as its importance, as the best approach. We demonstrate that RSQ consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple downstream tasks and three model families: LLaMA3, Mistral, and Qwen2.5. Additionally, models quantized with RSQ achieve superior performance on long-context tasks, further highlighting its effectiveness. Lastly, RSQ demonstrates generalizability across various setups, including different model sizes, calibration datasets, bit precisions, and quantization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhengyuan Jiang, Yuepeng Hu, Yuchen Yang, Yinzhi Cao, Neil Zhenqiang Gong</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image models may generate harmful content, such as pornographic images, particularly when unsafe prompts are submitted. To address this issue, safety filters are often added on top of text-to-image models, or the models themselves are aligned to reduce harmful outputs. However, these defenses remain vulnerable when an attacker strategically designs adversarial prompts to bypass these safety guardrails. In this work, we propose PromptTune, a method to jailbreak text-to-image models with safety guardrails using a fine-tuned large language model. Unlike other query-based jailbreak attacks that require repeated queries to the target model, our attack generates adversarial prompts efficiently after fine-tuning our AttackLLM. We evaluate our method on three datasets of unsafe prompts and against five safety guardrails. Our results demonstrate that our approach effectively bypasses safety guardrails, outperforms existing no-box attacks, and also facilitates other query-based attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lianghui Zhu, Xinggang Wang, Xinlong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-ended scenarios is challenging because existing benchmarks and metrics can not measure them comprehensively. To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges. We train JudgeLM at different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors. We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias. To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance. JudgeLM obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and our proposed new benchmark. Our JudgeLM is efficient and the JudgeLM-7B only needs 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs. JudgeLM obtains high agreement with the teacher judge, achieving an agreement exceeding 90% that even surpasses human-to-human agreement. JudgeLM also demonstrates extended capabilities in being judges of the single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, multi-turn chat, etc. Code is available at https://github.com/baaivision/JudgeLM.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiyu Song, Zhanchao Zhou, Jianhao Yan, Yuejiao Fei, Zhenzhong Lan, Yue Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction tuning is a burgeoning method to elicit the general intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs). While numerous studies have examined the impact of factors such as data volume and model size on English models, the scaling properties of instruction tuning in other languages remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of data quantity, model size, and data construction methods on instruction tuning for Chinese LLMs. We utilize a newly curated dataset, DoIT, which includes over 40,000 high-quality instruction instances covering ten underlying abilities, such as creative writing, code generation, and logical reasoning. Our experiments, conducted on models ranging from 7b to 33b parameters, yield three key findings: (i) While these factors directly affect overall model performance, some abilities are more responsive to scaling, whereas others demonstrate significant resistance. (ii) The scaling sensitivity of different abilities to these factors can be explained by two features: Complexity and Transference. (iii) By tailoring training strategies to their varying sensitivities, specific abilities can be efficiently learned, enhancing performance on two public benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangding Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) models, such as planning and reasoning capabilities. However, the problems of LLMs and RL model collaboration still need to be solved. In this study, we employ a teacher-student learning framework to tackle these problems, specifically by offering feedback for LLMs using RL models and providing high-level information for RL models with LLMs in a cooperative multi-agent setting. Within this framework, the LLM acts as a teacher, while the RL model acts as a student. The two agents cooperatively assist each other through a process of recursive help, such as "I help you help I help." The LLM agent supplies abstract information to the RL agent, enabling efficient exploration and policy improvement. In turn, the RL agent offers feedback to the LLM agent, providing valuable, real-time information that helps generate more useful tokens. This bi-directional feedback loop promotes optimization, exploration, and mutual improvement for both agents, enabling them to accomplish increasingly challenging tasks. Remarkably, we propose a practical algorithm to address the problem and conduct empirical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rheeya Uppaal, Yixuan Li, Junjie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in scale have enabled the emergence of powerful generative language models, and the ability to fine-tune these models on various tasks by casting them into prompts or instructions. In this landscape, the problem of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), or the problem of leveraging knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, has been left behind, with recent UDA methods still addressing discriminative classification. In particular, two popular UDA approaches, involving Continued Pre-Training (CPT) and learning domain invariant representations, have been under-explored in the generative setting, signaling a gap. In this work, we evaluate the utility of CPT for generative UDA. We first perform an empirical evaluation to measure the trade-offs between CPT and strong methods promoting domain invariance. We further evaluate how well the benefits of CPT extend to different architectures, tuning methods and data regimes. We then motivate the use of CPT by studying to what degree it benefits classification performance on the target domain. Finally, we attempt to understand the mechanism behind which CPT improves classification performance on the unlabeled target domain. Our findings suggest that a implicitly learns the downstream task while predicting masked words informative to that task. Our work connects the body of UDA research with that of instruction tuning, enabling an initial step towards a wider applicability of modern language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: All text-based language problems can be reduced to either generation or embedding. Current models only perform well at one or the other. We introduce generative representational instruction tuning (GRIT) whereby a large language model is trained to handle both generative and embedding tasks by distinguishing between them through instructions. Compared to other open models, our resulting GritLM 7B sets a new state of the art on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and outperforms all models up to its size on a range of generative tasks. By scaling up further, GritLM 8x7B outperforms all open generative language models that we tried while still being among the best embedding models. Notably, we find that GRIT matches training on only generative or embedding data, thus we can unify both at no performance loss. Among other benefits, the unification via GRIT speeds up Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by > 60% for long documents, by no longer requiring separate retrieval and generation models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxiang Liu, Tong Zhou, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Mitigating the hallucinations of Large Language Models is a crucial task. Although some existing methods employ self-enhancement techniques, they fall short of effectively addressing unknown factual hallucinations. Meanwhile, Knowledge Graph (KG) enhancement approaches fail to address the generalization across different KG sources and the enhancement of open-ended answer questions simultaneously. To tackle these limitations, we propose a framework that combines Pseudo-Graph Generation and Atomic Knowledge Verification (PG\&AKV). Enhancement of open-ended question-answering begins with leveraging the Pseudo-Graph Generation to provide the related knowledge framework. Subsequently, Atomic Knowledge Verification utilizes atomic-level knowledge querying and verification to achieve generalizability under different KG sources. Compared to the baseline, this approach yields a minimum improvement of 11.5 in the ROUGE-L score for open-ended questions. For precise-answered questions, we observe a minimum accuracy improvement of 7.5%. Moreover, PG\&AKV also exhibits generalizability across different KG sources. Utilizing KG different from the question sources, PG\&AKV can even achieve at least a 3.5 % performance improvement. In summary, our results pave the way for enhancing LLMs by incorporating Pseudo- and Multisource-KGs, particularly in the filed of open-ended questions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dhairya Dalal, Marco Valentino, Andr\'e Freitas, Paul Buitelaar</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have found success in real-world applications, their underlying explanatory process is still poorly understood. This paper proposes IBE-Eval, a framework inspired by philosophical accounts on Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) to advance the interpretation and evaluation of LLMs' explanations. IBE-Eval estimates the plausibility of natural language explanations through a combination of explicit logical and linguistic features including: consistency, parsimony, coherence, and uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on Causal Question Answering (CQA), where \textit{IBE-Eval} is tasked to select the most plausible causal explanation amongst competing ones generated by LLMs (i.e., GPT 3.5 and Llama 2). The experiments reveal that IBE-Eval can successfully identify the best explanation with up to 77\% accuracy ($\approx 27\%$ above random), improving upon a GPT 3.5-as-a-Judge baseline ($\approx+17\%$) while being intrinsically more efficient and interpretable. Additional analyses suggest that, despite model-specific variances, LLM-generated explanations tend to conform to IBE criteria and that IBE-Eval is significantly correlated with human judgment, opening up opportunities for future development of automated explanation verification tools.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable advancement in various NLP tasks. As such, a popular trend has emerged lately where NLP researchers extract word/sentence/document embeddings from these large decoder-only models and use them for various inference tasks with promising results. However, it is still unclear whether the performance improvement of LLM-induced embeddings is merely because of scale or whether underlying embeddings they produce significantly differ from classical encoding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) or Universal Sentence Encoder (USE). This is the central question we investigate in the paper by systematically comparing classical decontextualized and contextualized word embeddings with the same for LLM-induced embeddings. Our results show that LLMs cluster semantically related words more tightly and perform better on analogy tasks in decontextualized settings. However, in contextualized settings, classical models like SimCSE often outperform LLMs in sentence-level similarity assessment tasks, highlighting their continued relevance for fine-grained semantics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yumeng Fu, Junjie Wu, Zhongjie Wang, Meishan Zhang, Lili Shan, Yulin Wu, Bingquan Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC), the task of discerning human emotions for each utterance within a conversation, has garnered significant attention in human-computer interaction systems. Previous ERC studies focus on speaker-specific information that predominantly stems from relationships among utterances, which lacks sufficient information around conversations. Recent research in ERC has sought to exploit pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with speaker modelling to comprehend emotional states. Although these methods have achieved encouraging results, the extracted speaker-specific information struggles to indicate emotional dynamics. In this paper, motivated by the fact that speaker characteristics play a crucial role and LLMs have rich world knowledge, we present LaERC-S, a novel framework that stimulates LLMs to explore speaker characteristics involving the mental state and behavior of interlocutors, for accurate emotion predictions. To endow LLMs with this knowledge information, we adopt the two-stage learning to make the models reason speaker characteristics and track the emotion of the speaker in complex conversation scenarios. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of LaERC-S, reaching the new state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) often confronts challenges stemming from the heavy reliance on human annotators in the reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) framework, or the frequent and costly external queries tied to the self-instruct paradigm. In this work, we pivot to Reinforcement Learning (RL) -- but with a twist. Diverging from the typical RLHF, which refines LLMs following instruction data training, we use RL to directly generate the foundational instruction dataset that alone suffices for fine-tuning. Our method, TeaMs-RL, uses a suite of textual operations and rules, prioritizing the diversification of training datasets. It facilitates the generation of high-quality data without excessive reliance on external advanced models, paving the way for a single fine-tuning step and negating the need for subsequent RLHF stages. Our findings highlight key advantages of our approach: reduced need for human involvement and fewer model queries (only 5.73% of the strong baseline's total), along with enhanced capabilities of LLMs in crafting and comprehending complex instructions compared to strong baselines, and substantially improved model privacy protection.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingling Li, Zeyu Tang, Xiaoyu Liu, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang, Liu Leqi, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, are susceptible to generating biased and discriminatory responses. As LLMs increasingly influence high-stakes decision-making (e.g., hiring and healthcare), mitigating these biases becomes critical. In this work, we propose a causality-guided debiasing framework to tackle social biases, aiming to reduce the objectionable dependence between LLMs' decisions and the social information in the input. Our framework introduces a novel perspective to identify how social information can affect an LLM's decision through different causal pathways. Leveraging these causal insights, we outline principled prompting strategies that regulate these pathways through selection mechanisms. This framework not only unifies existing prompting-based debiasing techniques, but also opens up new directions for reducing bias by encouraging the model to prioritize fact-based reasoning over reliance on biased social cues. We validate our framework through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across multiple domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in debiasing LLM decisions, even with only black-box access to the model.</p>

To find these unnecessary parameters, we identify the optimal block of layers to prune by considering similarity across layers; then, to "heal" the damage, we perform a small amount of finetuning. Surprisingly, with this method we find minimal degradation of performance until after a large fraction (up to half) of the layers are removed for some common open-weight models. From a scientific perspective, the robustness of these LLMs to the deletion of layers implies either that current pretraining methods are not properly leveraging the parameters in the deeper layers of the network or that the shallow layers play a critical role in storing knowledge. For our study, we use parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods, specifically quantization and Low Rank Adapters (QLoRA), such that each of our experiments can be performed on a single 40GB A100 GPU.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianle Xia, Liang Ding, Guojia Wan, Yibing Zhan, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Answering complex queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) is a challenging job. Most previous works have focused on learning entity/relation embeddings and simulating first-order logic operators with various neural networks. However, they are bottlenecked by the inability to share world knowledge to improve logical reasoning, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a complex reasoning schema over KG upon large language models (LLMs), containing a curriculum-based logical-aware instruction tuning framework, named LACT. Specifically, we augment the arbitrary first-order logical queries via binary tree decomposition, to stimulate the reasoning capability of LLMs. To address the difficulty gap among different types of complex queries, we design a simple and flexible logic-aware curriculum learning framework. Experiments across widely used datasets demonstrate that LACT has substantial improvements~(brings an average +5.5% MRR score) over advanced methods, achieving the new state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhinav Lalwani, Tasha Kim, Lovish Chopra, Christopher Hahn, Zhijing Jin, Mrinmaya Sachan</p>
<p>Abstract: Translating natural language into formal language such as First-Order Logic (FOL) is a foundational challenge in NLP with wide-ranging applications in automated reasoning, misinformation tracking, and knowledge validation. In this paper, we introduce Natural Language to First-Order Logic (NL2FOL), a framework to autoformalize natural language to FOL step by step using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach addresses key challenges in this translation process, including the integration of implicit background knowledge. By leveraging structured representations generated by NL2FOL, we use Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to reason about the logical validity of natural language statements. We present logical fallacy detection as a case study to evaluate the efficacy of NL2FOL. Being neurosymbolic, our approach also provides interpretable insights into the reasoning process and demonstrates robustness without requiring model fine-tuning or labeled training data. Our framework achieves strong performance on multiple datasets. On the LOGIC dataset, NL2FOL achieves an F1-score of 78%, while generalizing effectively to the LOGICCLIMATE dataset with an F1-score of 80%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junchao Wu, Runzhe Zhan, Derek F. Wong, Shu Yang, Xuebo Liu, Lidia S. Chao, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The efficacy of detectors for texts generated by large language models (LLMs) substantially depends on the availability of large-scale training data. However, white-box zero-shot detectors, which require no such data, are limited by the accessibility of the source model of the LLM-generated text. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective black-box zero-shot detection approach based on the observation that, from the perspective of LLMs, human-written texts typically contain more grammatical errors than LLM-generated texts. This approach involves calculating the Grammar Error Correction Score (GECScore) for the given text to differentiate between human-written and LLM-generated text. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot and supervised methods, achieving an average AUROC of 98.62% across XSum and Writing Prompts dataset. Additionally, our approach demonstrates strong reliability in the wild, exhibiting robust generalization and resistance to paraphrasing attacks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rheeya Uppaal, Apratim Dey, Yiting He, Yiqiao Zhong, Junjie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent alignment algorithms such as direct preference optimization (DPO) have been developed to improve the safety of large language models (LLMs) by training these models to match human behaviors exemplified by preference data. However, these methods are both computationally intensive and lacking in controllability and transparency, inhibiting their widespread use. Furthermore, these tuning-based methods require large-scale preference data for training and are susceptible to noisy preference data. In this paper, we introduce a tuning-free alignment alternative, ProFS (Projection Filter for Subspaces), and demonstrate its effectiveness under the use case of toxicity reduction. Grounded on theory from factor analysis, ProFS is a sample-efficient model editing approach that identifies a toxic subspace in the model parameter space and reduces model toxicity by projecting away the detected subspace. The toxic subspace is identified by extracting preference data embeddings from the language model, and removing non-toxic information from these embeddings. We show that ProFS is more sample-efficient than DPO, further showcasing greater robustness to noisy data. Finally, we attempt to connect tuning based alignment with editing, by establishing both theoretical and empirical connections between ProFS and DPO, showing that ProFS can be interpreted as a denoised version of a single DPO step.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun-Yu Ma, Hong Wang, Hao-Xiang Xu, Zhen-Hua Ling, Jia-Chen Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Model editing is an emerging field that focuses on updating the knowledge embedded within large language models (LLMs) without extensive retraining. However, current model editing methods significantly compromise the general abilities of LLMs as the number of edits increases, and this trade-off poses a substantial challenge to the continual learning of LLMs. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze that the factor affecting the general abilities in sequential model editing lies in the condition number of the edited matrix. The condition number of a matrix represents its numerical sensitivity, and therefore can be used to indicate the extent to which the original knowledge associations stored in LLMs are perturbed after editing. Subsequently, statistical findings demonstrate that the value of this factor becomes larger as the number of edits increases, thereby exacerbating the deterioration of general abilities. To this end, a framework termed Perturbation Restraint on Upper bouNd for Editing (PRUNE) is proposed, which applies the condition number restraints in sequential editing. These restraints can lower the upper bound on perturbation to edited models, thus preserving the general abilities. Systematically, we conduct experiments employing three editing methods on three LLMs across four downstream tasks. The results show that PRUNE can preserve general abilities while maintaining the editing performance effectively in sequential model editing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boammani Aser Lompo, Thanh-Dung Le</p>
<p>Abstract: The processing of numerical values is a rapidly developing area in the field of Language Models (LLMs). Despite numerous advancements achieved by previous research, significant challenges persist, particularly within the healthcare domain. This paper investigates the limitations of Transformer models in understanding numerical values. \textit{Objective:} this research aims to categorize numerical values extracted from medical documents into eight specific physiological categories using CamemBERT-bio. \textit{Methods:} In a context where scalable methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) are emphasized, we explore lifting the limitations of transformer-based models. We examine two strategies: fine-tuning CamemBERT-bio on a small medical dataset, integrating Label Embedding for Self-Attention (LESA), and combining LESA with additional enhancement techniques such as Xval. Given that CamemBERT-bio is already pre-trained on a large medical dataset, the first approach aims to update its encoder with the newly added label embeddings technique. In contrast, the second approach seeks to develop multiple representations of numbers (contextual and magnitude-based) to achieve more robust number embeddings. \textit{Results:} As anticipated, fine-tuning the standard CamemBERT-bio on our small medical dataset did not improve F1 scores. However, significant improvements were observed with CamemBERT-bio + LESA, resulting in an over 13\% increase. Similar enhancements were noted when combining LESA with Xval, outperforming conventional methods and giving comparable results to GPT-4 \textit{Conclusions and Novelty:} This study introduces two innovative techniques for handling numerical data, which are also applicable to other modalities. We illustrate how these techniques can improve the performance of Transformer-based models, achieving more reliable classification results even with small datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachun Li, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Jiexin Xu, Huaijun Li, Xiaojian Jiang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leveraging multiple large language model (LLM) agents has shown to be a promising approach for tackling complex tasks, while the effective design of multiple agents for a particular application remains an art. It is thus intriguing to answer a critical question: Given a task, how can we build a team of LLM agents to solve it effectively? Our new adaptive team-building paradigm offers a flexible solution, realized through a novel agent design named Captain Agent. It dynamically forms and manages teams for each step of a task-solving process, utilizing nested group conversations and reflection to ensure diverse expertise and prevent stereotypical outputs, allowing for a flexible yet structured approach to problem-solving. A comprehensive evaluation across six real-world scenarios demonstrates that Captain Agent significantly outperforms existing multi-agent methods with 21.94% improvement in average accuracy, providing outstanding performance without requiring task-specific prompt engineering. Our exploration of different backbone LLM and cost analysis further shows that Captain Agent can improve the conversation quality of weak LLM and achieve competitive performance with extremely low cost, which illuminates the application of multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suraj Anand, Michael A. Lepori, Jack Merullo, Ellie Pavlick</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have the ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), allowing them to flexibly adapt their behavior based on context. This contrasts with in-weights learning (IWL), where memorized information is encoded in model parameters after iterated observations of data. An ideal model should be able to flexibly deploy both of these abilities. Despite their apparent ability to learn in-context, language models are known to struggle when faced with unseen or rarely seen tokens (Land & Bartolo, 2024). Hence, we study $\textbf{structural in-context learning}$, which we define as the ability of a model to execute in-context learning on arbitrary novel tokens -- so called because the model must generalize on the basis of e.g. sentence structure or task structure, rather than content encoded in token embeddings. We study structural in-context algorithms on both synthetic and naturalistic tasks using toy models, masked language models, and autoregressive language models. We find that structural ICL appears before quickly disappearing early in LM pretraining. While it has been shown that ICL can diminish during training (Singh et al., 2023), we find that prior work does not account for structural ICL. Building on Chen et al. (2024) 's active forgetting method, we introduce pretraining and finetuning methods that can modulate the preference for structural ICL and IWL. Importantly, this allows us to induce a $\textit{dual process strategy}$ where in-context and in-weights solutions coexist within a single model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxin Wen, Ruiqi Zhong, Pei Ke, Zhihong Shao, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: When using language models (LMs) to solve complex problems, humans might struggle to understand the LM-generated solutions and repair the flawed ones. To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3\% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seungeun Rho, Laura Smith, Tianyu Li, Sergey Levine, Xue Bin Peng, Sehoon Ha</p>
<p>Abstract: Skill discovery methods enable agents to learn diverse emergent behaviors without explicit rewards. To make learned skills useful for unknown downstream tasks, obtaining a semantically diverse repertoire of skills is essential. While some approaches introduce a discriminator to distinguish skills and others aim to increase state coverage, no existing work directly addresses the "semantic diversity" of skills. We hypothesize that leveraging the semantic knowledge of large language models (LLMs) can lead us to improve semantic diversity of resulting behaviors. In this sense, we introduce Language Guided Skill Discovery (LGSD), a skill discovery framework that aims to directly maximize the semantic diversity between skills. LGSD takes user prompts as input and outputs a set of semantically distinctive skills. The prompts serve as a means to constrain the search space into a semantically desired subspace, and the generated LLM outputs guide the agent to visit semantically diverse states within the subspace. We demonstrate that LGSD enables legged robots to visit different user-intended areas on a plane by simply changing the prompt. Furthermore, we show that language guidance aids in discovering more diverse skills compared to five existing skill discovery methods in robot-arm manipulation environments. Lastly, LGSD provides a simple way of utilizing learned skills via natural language.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqing Wang, Yixia Li, Shuo Wang, Guanhua Chen, Yun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient finetuning of large language models (LLMs) aims to adapt the LLMs with reduced computational and memory cost. Previous LoRA-based approaches initialize the low-rank matrices with Gaussian distribution and zero values while keeping the original weight matrices frozen. However, the trainable model parameters optimized in an unguided subspace might interfere with the well-learned subspace of the pretrained weight matrices. In this paper, we propose MiLoRA, a simple yet effective LLM finetuning approach that only updates the minor singular components of the weight matrix while keeping the principal singular components frozen. It is observed that the minor matrix corresponds to the noisy or long-tail information, while the principal matrix contains important knowledge. The MiLoRA initializes the low-rank matrices within a subspace that is orthogonal to the principal matrix, thus the pretrained knowledge is expected to be well preserved. During finetuning, MiLoRA makes the most use of the less-optimized subspace for learning the labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, instruction following and visual instruction following benchmarks present the superior performance of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amith Ananthram, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Kathleen McKeown</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can respond to queries about images in many languages. However, beyond language, culture affects how we see things. For example, individuals from Western cultures focus more on the central figure in an image while individuals from East Asian cultures attend more to scene context. In this work, we characterize the Western bias of VLMs in image understanding and investigate the role that language plays in this disparity. We evaluate VLMs across subjective and objective visual tasks with culturally diverse images and annotations. We find that VLMs perform better on the Western split than on the East Asian split of each task. Through controlled experimentation, we trace one source of this bias in image understanding to the lack of diversity in language model construction. While inference in a language nearer to a culture can lead to reductions in bias, we show it is much more effective when that language was well-represented during text-only pre-training. Interestingly, this yields bias reductions even when prompting in English. Our work highlights the importance of richer representation of all languages in building equitable VLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhepei Wei, Wei-Lin Chen, Yu Meng</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising potential to enhance the accuracy and factuality of language models (LMs). However, imperfect retrievers or noisy corpora can introduce misleading or even erroneous information to the retrieved contents, posing a significant challenge to the generation quality. Existing RAG methods typically address this challenge by directly predicting final answers despite potentially noisy inputs, resulting in an implicit denoising process that is difficult to interpret and verify. On the other hand, the acquisition of explicit denoising supervision is often costly, involving significant human efforts. In this work, we propose InstructRAG, where LMs explicitly learn the denoising process through self-synthesized rationales -- First, we instruct the LM to explain how the ground-truth answer is derived from retrieved documents. Then, these rationales can be used either as demonstrations for in-context learning of explicit denoising or as supervised fine-tuning data to train the model. Compared to standard RAG approaches, InstructRAG requires no additional supervision, allows for easier verification of the predicted answers, and effectively improves generation accuracy. Experiments show InstructRAG consistently outperforms existing RAG methods in both training-free and trainable scenarios, achieving a relative improvement of 8.3% over the best baseline method on average across five knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Extensive analysis indicates that InstructRAG scales well with increased numbers of retrieved documents and consistently exhibits robust denoising ability even in out-of-domain datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Identifying underlying user goals and intents has been recognized as valuable in various personalization-oriented settings, such as personalized agents, improved search responses, advertising, user analytics, and more. In this paper, we propose a new task goal identification from observed UI trajectories aiming to infer the user's detailed intentions when performing a task within UI environments. To support this task, we also introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to assess whether two intent descriptions can be considered paraphrases within a specific UI environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this task can leverage datasets designed for the inverse problem of UI automation, utilizing Android and web datasets for our experiments. To benchmark this task, we compare the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro, using our proposed metric. The results reveal that both Gemini and GPT underperform relative to human performance, underscoring the challenge of the proposed task and the significant room for improvement. This work highlights the importance of goal identification within UI trajectories, providing a foundation for further exploration and advancement in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Truthfulness stands out as an essential challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although many works have developed various ways for truthfulness enhancement, they seldom focus on truthfulness in multilingual scenarios. Meanwhile, contemporary multilingual aligning technologies struggle to balance numerous languages and often exhibit serious truthfulness gaps across different languages, especially those that differ greatly from English. In our work, we extend truthfulness evaluation to multilingual contexts and propose a practical method for cross-lingual truthfulness transfer called Fact-aware Multilingual Selective Synergy (FaMSS). FaMSS is able to select an optimal subset of all tested languages by language bias and transfer contributions, and then employ translation instruction tuning for cross-lingual truthfulness transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively reduce the multilingual representation disparity and boost cross-lingual truthfulness transfer of LLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across multiple languages. However, the relationship between capabilities in different languages is less explored. In this work, we decompose the process of reasoning tasks into two separated components: knowledge retrieval and knowledge-free reasoning, and analyze the relationship between cross-lingual transferability and these two components. With adapted commonsense reasoning datasets and constructed knowledge-free reasoning datasets, we show that the knowledge-free reasoning capability can be nearly perfectly transferred across various source-target language directions despite the secondary impact of resource in some specific target languages, while cross-lingual knowledge retrieval significantly hinders the transfer. Moreover, by analyzing the hidden states and feed-forward network neuron activation during the reasoning, we show that higher similarity of hidden representations and larger overlap of activated neurons could explain the better cross-lingual transferability of knowledge-free reasoning than knowledge retrieval. Thus, we hypothesize that knowledge-free reasoning shares similar neurons in different languages for reasoning, while knowledge is stored separately in different languages.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Afra Amini, Tim Vieira, Elliott Ash, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Best-of-N (BoN) is a popular and effective algorithm for aligning language models to human preferences. The algorithm works as follows: at inference time, N samples are drawn from the language model, and the sample with the highest reward, as judged by a reward model, is returned as the output. Despite its effectiveness, BoN is computationally expensive; it reduces sampling throughput by a factor of N. To make BoN more efficient at inference time, one strategy is to fine-tune the language model to mimic what BoN does during inference. To achieve this, we derive the distribution induced by the BoN algorithm. We then propose to fine-tune the language model to minimize backward KL divergence to the BoN distribution. Our approach is analogous to mean-field variational inference and, thus, we term it variational BoN (vBoN). To the extent this fine-tuning is successful and we end up with a good approximation, we have reduced the inference cost by a factor of N. Our experiments on controlled generation and summarization tasks show that BoN is the most effective alignment method, and our variational approximation to BoN achieves the closest performance to BoN and surpasses models fine-tuned using the standard KL-constrained RL objective. In the controlled generation task, vBoN appears more frequently on the Pareto frontier of reward and KL divergence compared to other alignment methods. In the summarization task, vBoN achieves high reward values across various sampling temperatures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human feedback data is a critical component in developing language models. However, collecting this feedback is costly and ultimately not scalable. Inspired by the way human interlocutors provide spontaneous unsolicited feedback to each other, we propose to extract feedback that users naturally include when interacting with chat models. We manually annotated conversations to confirm the presence of naturally occurring feedback in a standard corpus, finding that as much as 30% of the chats include explicit feedback. Comparing to older datasets, we find that naturally occurring feedback is more prevalent in recent conversation datasets, suggesting that more than ever, naturally occurring feedback can serve as a valuable resource for feedback data. We propose a method for automatically extracting this feedback, and apply it to over 1M conversations to obtain hundreds of thousands of feedback samples. The extracted feedback shows promise: training with it improves over baseline models and enhances model alignment to human preferences.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shangyu Wu, Ying Xiong, Yufei Cui, Haolun Wu, Can Chen, Ye Yuan, Lianming Huang, Xue Liu, Tei-Wei Kuo, Nan Guan, Chun Jason Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in various fields, benefiting from their huge amount of parameters that store knowledge. However, LLMs still suffer from several key issues, such as hallucination problems, knowledge update issues, and lacking domain-specific expertise. The appearance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which leverages an external knowledge database to augment LLMs, makes up those drawbacks of LLMs. This paper reviews all significant techniques of RAG, especially in the retriever and the retrieval fusions. Besides, tutorial codes are provided for implementing the representative techniques in RAG. This paper further discusses the RAG update, including RAG with/without knowledge update. Then, we introduce RAG evaluation and benchmarking, as well as the application of RAG in representative NLP tasks and industrial scenarios. Finally, this paper discusses RAG's future directions and challenges for promoting this field's development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyi Wang, Antonis Antoniades, Yanai Elazar, Alfonso Amayuelas, Alon Albalak, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongming Tan, Shaoxiong Zhan, Hai Lin, Hai-Tao Zheng, Wai Kin Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: In dense retrieval, embedding long texts into dense vectors can result in information loss, leading to inaccurate query-text matching. Additionally, low-quality texts with excessive noise or sparse key information are unlikely to align well with relevant queries. Recent studies mainly focus on improving the sentence embedding model or retrieval process. In this work, we introduce a novel text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. This framework transforms raw documents into information-dense text formats, which supplement the original texts to effectively address the aforementioned issues without modifying embedding or retrieval methodologies. Two text representations are generated via large language models (LLMs) zero-shot prompting: question-answer pairs and element-driven events. We term this approach QAEA-DR: unifying question-answer generation and event extraction in a text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. To further enhance the quality of generated texts, a scoring-based evaluation and regeneration mechanism is introduced in LLM prompting. Our QAEA-DR model has a positive impact on dense retrieval, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hui Ma, Bo Zhang, Bo Xu, Jian Wang, Hongfei Lin, Xiao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Empathetic response generation, aiming to understand the user's situation and feelings and respond empathically, is crucial in building human-like dialogue systems. Traditional approaches typically employ maximum likelihood estimation as the optimization objective during training, yet fail to align the empathy levels between generated and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic response generation framework using reinforcement learning (EmpRL). The framework develops an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning. EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and further fine-tunes it to initialize the policy. To align the empathy levels between generated and target responses within a given context, an empathy reward function containing three empathy communication mechanisms -- emotional reaction, interpretation, and exploration -- is constructed using pre-designed and pre-trained empathy identifiers. During reinforcement learning training, the proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to fine-tune the policy, enabling the generation of empathetic responses. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL framework significantly improves the quality of generated responses, enhances the similarity in empathy levels between generated and target responses, and produces empathetic responses covering both affective and cognitive aspects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Objective: This study aims to develop and validate an evaluation framework to ensure the safety and reliability of mental health chatbots, which are increasingly popular due to their accessibility, human-like interactions, and context-aware support. Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information, demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health chatbots. While LLMs have significant potential, careful implementation is necessary to mitigate risks. The superior performance of the agentic approach underscores the importance of real-time data access in enhancing chatbot reliability. Conclusion: The study validated an evaluation framework for mental health chatbots, proving its effectiveness in improving safety and reliability. Future work should extend evaluations to accuracy, bias, empathy, and privacy to ensure holistic assessment and responsible integration into healthcare. Standardized evaluations will build trust among users and professionals, facilitating broader adoption and improved mental health support through technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Uri Berger, Gabriel Stanovsky, Omri Abend, Lea Frermann</p>
<p>Abstract: The task of image captioning has recently been gaining popularity, and with it the complex task of evaluating the quality of image captioning models. In this work, we present the first survey and taxonomy of over 70 different image captioning metrics and their usage in hundreds of papers, specifically designed to help users select the most suitable metric for their needs. We find that despite the diversity of proposed metrics, the vast majority of studies rely on only five popular metrics, which we show to be weakly correlated with human ratings. We hypothesize that combining a diverse set of metrics can enhance correlation with human ratings. As an initial step, we demonstrate that a linear regression-based ensemble method, which we call EnsembEval, trained on one human ratings dataset, achieves improved correlation across five additional datasets, showing there is a lot of room for improvement by leveraging a diverse set of metrics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human-model conversations provide a window into users' real-world scenarios, behavior, and needs, and thus are a valuable resource for model development and research. While for-profit companies collect user data through the APIs of their models, using it internally to improve their own models, the open source and research community lags behind.
  We introduce the ShareLM collection, a unified set of human conversations with large language models, and its accompanying plugin, a Web extension for voluntarily contributing user-model conversations. Where few platforms share their chats, the ShareLM plugin adds this functionality, thus, allowing users to share conversations from most platforms. The plugin allows the user to rate their conversations, both at the conversation and the response levels, and delete conversations they prefer to keep private before they ever leave the user's local storage. We release the plugin conversations as part of the ShareLM collection, and call for more community effort in the field of open human-model data.
  The code, plugin, and data are available.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10557">Speech Representation Learning Revisited: The Necessity of Separate Learnable Parameters and Robust Data Augmentation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hemant Yadav, Sunayana Sitaram, Rajiv Ratn Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech modeling methods learn one embedding for a fixed segment of speech, typically in between 10-25 ms. The information present in speech can be divided into two categories: "what is being said" (content) and "how it is expressed" (other) and these two are orthogonal in nature causing the optimization algorithm to find a sub-optimal solution if forced to optimize together. This leads to sub-optimal performance in one or all downstream tasks as shown by previous studies. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods such as HuBERT are very good at modeling the content information present in speech. Data augmentation improves the performance on tasks which require effective modeling of other information but this leads to a divided capacity of the model. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study to understand the importance of modeling other information using separate learnable parameters. We propose a modified version of HuBERT, termed Other HuBERT (O-HuBERT), to test our hypothesis. Our findings are twofold: first, the O-HuBERT method is able to utilize all layers to build complex features to encode other information; second, a robust data augmentation strategy is essential for learning the information required by tasks that depend on other information and to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the SUPERB benchmark with a similarly sized model (100 million parameters) and pre-training data (960 hours).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Hao Wang, Shengming Zhao, Jie Chen, Sheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities, yet existing prompting methods face a critical trade-off: simple approaches often struggle with complex tasks and reasoning stability, while more sophisticated methods require multiple inferences and substantial computational resources, limiting their practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose Derailer-Rerailer, a novel framework that adaptively balances reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. At its core, our framework employs a lightweight Derailer mechanism to assess reasoning stability and selectively triggers an advanced Rerailer verification process only when necessary, thereby optimizing computational resource usage. Extensive evaluation across both open and closed-source models on more than 20 categories of mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrates our framework's effectiveness: Derailer-Rerailer achieves significant accuracy improvements (8-11\% across various reasoning tasks) while maintaining 2-3 times better efficiency than existing verification methods, with particularly strong performance in mathematical and symbolic reasoning, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning reliability while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiace Zhu, Yingtao Shen, Jie Zhao, An Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), self-consistency has gained significant popularity by combining multiple sampling with majority voting. However, the state-of-the-art self-consistency approaches consume substantial computational resources and lead to significant additional time costs due to the multiple sampling. This prevents its full potential from being realized in scenarios where computational resources are critical. To improve the inference efficiency, this paper introduces \textit{path-consistency}, a method that leverages the confidence of answers generated in earlier branches to identify the prefix of the most promising path. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, the \textit{path-consistency} mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. As a result, it can significantly accelerate the inference process by reducing the number of tokens generated. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the \textit{path-consistency} achieves significant acceleration in inference latency ranging from $7.8\%$ to $40.5\%$, while maintaining or even improving task accuracy across different datasets, including mathematical reasoning, common sense reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and code generation.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01482">Masked Mixers for Language Generation and Retrieval</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin L. Badger</p>
<p>Abstract: Attention mechanisms that confer selective focus on a strict subset of input elements are nearly ubiquitous in language models today. We posit there to be downside to the use of attention: most input information is lost. In support of this idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers and more accurate representation in what we term masked mixers, which replace self-attention with masked convolutions. The masked mixer learns causal language modeling more efficiently than early transformer implementations and even outperforms optimized, current transformers when training on small (<512) but not larger context windows. Evidence is presented for the hypothesis that differences in transformer and masked mixer training efficiencies for various tasks are best predicted by input representation accuracy, or equivalently global invertibility. We hypothesize that the information loss exhibited by transformers would be more detrimental to retrieval than generation, as the former is more closely approximated by a bijective and thus invertible function. We find that masked mixers are more effective retrieval models both when the pretrained embedding model is unchanged as well as when the embedding model is modified via cosine similarity-based InfoNCE loss minimization. A small masked mixer is shown to outperform a large and near state-of-the-art transformer-based retrieval model, despite the latter being trained with many orders of magnitude more data and compute.</p>

<p>Abstract: Models like GPT-4o enable real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, significantly enhancing user experience compared to traditional text-based interaction. However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andrea Silvi, Jonathan Thomas, Emil Carlsson, Devdatt Dubhashi, Moa Johansson</p>
<p>Abstract: It has previously been shown that by using reinforcement learning (RL), agents can derive simple approximate and exact-restricted numeral systems that are similar to human ones (Carlsson, 2021). However, it is a major challenge to show how more complex recursive numeral systems, similar to for example English, could arise via a simple learning mechanism such as RL. Here, we introduce an approach towards deriving a mechanistic explanation of the emergence of efficient recursive number systems. We consider pairs of agents learning how to communicate about numerical quantities through a meta-grammar that can be gradually modified throughout the interactions. %We find that the seminal meta-grammar of Hurford (Hurford, 1975) is not suitable for this application as its optimization results in systems that deviate from standard conventions observed within human numeral systems. We propose a simple modification which addresses this issue. Utilising a slightly modified version of the meta-grammar of Hurford, we demonstrate that our RL agents, shaped by the pressures for efficient communication, can effectively modify their lexicon towards Pareto-optimal configurations which are comparable to those observed within human numeral systems in terms of their efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danyang Liu, Mirella Lapata, Frank Keller</p>
<p>Abstract: Characters are important in narratives. They move the plot forward, create emotional connections, and embody the story's themes. Visual storytelling methods focus more on the plot and events relating to it, without building the narrative around specific characters. As a result, the generated stories feel generic, with character mentions being absent, vague, or incorrect. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the new task of character-centric story generation and present the first model capable of predicting visual stories with consistently grounded and coreferent character mentions. Our model is finetuned on a new dataset which we build on top of the widely used VIST benchmark. Specifically, we develop an automated pipeline to enrich VIST with visual and textual character coreference chains. We also propose new evaluation metrics to measure the richness of characters and coreference in stories. Experimental results show that our model generates stories with recurring characters which are consistent and coreferent to larger extent compared to baselines and state-of-the-art systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: DNA Language Models, such as GROVER, DNABERT2 and the Nucleotide Transformer, operate on DNA sequences that inherently contain sequencing errors, mutations, and laboratory-induced noise, which may significantly impact model performance. Despite the importance of this issue, the robustness of DNA language models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we comprehensivly investigate their robustness in DNA classification by applying various adversarial attack strategies: the character (nucleotide substitutions), word (codon modifications), and sentence levels (back-translation-based transformations) to systematically analyze model vulnerabilities. Our results demonstrate that DNA language models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, leading to significant performance degradation. Furthermore, we explore adversarial training method as a defense mechanism, which enhances both robustness and classification accuracy. This study highlights the limitations of DNA language models and underscores the necessity of robustness in bioinformatics.</p>

<p>Abstract: Representations from large language models are highly effective at predicting BOLD fMRI responses to language stimuli. However, these representations are largely opaque: it is unclear what features of the language stimulus drive the response in each brain area. We present generative causal testing (GCT), a framework for generating concise explanations of language selectivity in the brain from predictive models and then testing those explanations in follow-up experiments using LLM-generated stimuli.This approach is successful at explaining selectivity both in individual voxels and cortical regions of interest (ROIs), including newly identified microROIs in prefrontal cortex. We show that explanatory accuracy is closely related to the predictive power and stability of the underlying predictive models. Finally, we show that GCT can dissect fine-grained differences between brain areas with similar functional selectivity. These results demonstrate that LLMs can be used to bridge the widening gap between data-driven models and formal scientific theories.</p>

<p>Abstract: Understanding the quality of a performance evaluation metric is crucial for ensuring that model outputs align with human preferences. However, it remains unclear how well each metric captures the diverse aspects of these preferences, as metrics often excel in one particular area but not across all dimensions. To address this, it is essential to systematically calibrate metrics to specific aspects of human preference, catering to the unique characteristics of each aspect. We introduce MetaMetrics, a calibrated meta-metric designed to evaluate generation tasks across different modalities in a supervised manner. MetaMetrics optimizes the combination of existing metrics to enhance their alignment with human preferences. Our metric demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness in both language and vision downstream tasks, showing significant benefits across various multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. MetaMetrics aligns closely with human preferences and is highly extendable and easily integrable into any application. This makes MetaMetrics a powerful tool for improving the evaluation of generation tasks, ensuring that metrics are more representative of human judgment across diverse contexts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shijie Chen, Bernal Jim\'enez Guti\'errez, Yu Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) systems have played a vital role in modern digital life and have cemented their continued usefulness in this new era of generative AI via retrieval-augmented generation. With strong language processing capabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have become popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far, LLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which restricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given these restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal for LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals relevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full potential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose in-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in attention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient re-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration method using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only requires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it substantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at least $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to any LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking. Extensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop and multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms RankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through detailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks that require more complex re-ranking signals. Our findings call for further exploration on novel ways of utilizing open-weight LLMs beyond text generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: As users increasingly seek guidance from LLMs for decision-making in daily life, many of these decisions are not clear-cut and depend significantly on the personal values and ethical standards of people. We present DailyDilemmas, a dataset of 1,360 moral dilemmas encountered in everyday life. Each dilemma presents two possible actions, along with affected parties and relevant human values for each action. Based on these dilemmas, we gather a repository of human values covering diverse everyday topics, such as interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. With DailyDilemmas, we evaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and the values represented by these action choices. Then, we analyze values through the lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and philosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions. For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over survival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations Theory. Interestingly, we find substantial preference differences in models for some core values. For example, for truthfulness, Mixtral-8x7B neglects it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo selects it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance released by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand how their designated principles reflect their models' actual value prioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings. Finally, we find that end users cannot effectively steer such prioritization using system prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoran Xu, Kenton Murray, Philipp Koehn, Hieu Hoang, Akiko Eriguchi, Huda Khayrallah</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks with a focus on English due to English-centric pre-training and limited multilingual data. In this work, we focus on the problem of translation, and while some multilingual LLMs claim to support for hundreds of languages, models often fail to provide high-quality responses for mid- and low-resource languages, leading to imbalanced performance heavily skewed in favor of high-resource languages. We introduce **X-ALMA**, a model designed to ensure top-tier performance across 50 diverse languages, regardless of their resource levels. X-ALMA surpasses state-of-the-art open-source multilingual LLMs, such as Aya-101 and Aya-23, in every single translation direction on the FLORES-200 and WMT'23 test datasets according to COMET-22. This is achieved by plug-and-play language-specific module architecture to prevent language conflicts during training and a carefully designed training regimen with novel optimization methods to maximize the translation performance. After the final stage of training regimen, our proposed **A**daptive **R**ejection **P**reference **O**ptimization (**ARPO**) surpasses existing preference optimization methods in translation tasks.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03524">Steering Large Language Models between Code Execution and Textual Reasoning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongchao Chen, Harsh Jhamtani, Srinagesh Sharma, Chuchu Fan, Chi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While a lot of recent research focuses on enhancing the textual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing the multi-agent framework or reasoning chains, several benchmark tasks can be solved with 100\% success through direct coding, which is more scalable and avoids the computational overhead associated with textual iterating and searching. Textual reasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math, logics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply scaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code Interpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated remarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve complex tasks using LLMs. However, based on our experiments on 7 existing popular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and multi-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new O1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to write code when needed. We discover some interesting patterns on when models use code vs. textual reasoning with the evolution to task complexity and model sizes, which even result in an astonishingly inverse scaling behavior. We also discover that results from LLM written code are not always better than using textual reasoning, even if the task could be solved through code. To mitigate the above issues, we propose three methods to better steer LLM code/text generation and achieve a notable improvement. The costs of token lengths and runtime are thoroughly discussed for all the methods. We believe the problem of steering LLM code/text generation is critical for future research and has much space for further improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenrui Yue, Honglei Zhuang, Aijun Bai, Kai Hui, Rolf Jagerman, Hansi Zeng, Zhen Qin, Dong Wang, Xuanhui Wang, Michael Bendersky</p>
<p>Abstract: The scaling of inference computation has unlocked the potential of long-context large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings. For knowledge-intensive tasks, the increased compute is often allocated to incorporate more external knowledge. However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring the combination of multiple strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge, including in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG performance across different inference configurations. The model predicts optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align closely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal configurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference compute on long-context LLMs achieves up to 58.9% gains on benchmark datasets compared to standard RAG.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05864">From Tokens to Words: On the Inner Lexicon of LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Guy Kaplan, Matanel Oren, Yuval Reif, Roy Schwartz</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural language is composed of words, but modern large language models (LLMs) process sub-words as input. A natural question raised by this discrepancy is whether LLMs encode words internally, and if so how. We present evidence that LLMs engage in an intrinsic detokenization process, where sub-word sequences are combined into coherent whole-word representations at their last token. Our experiments show that this process primarily takes place within the early and middle layers of the model. We further demonstrate its robustness to arbitrary splits (e.g., "cats" to "ca" and "ts"), typos, and importantly-to out-of-vocabulary words: when feeding the last token internal representations of such words to the model as input, it can "understand" them as the complete word despite never seeing such representations as input during training. Our findings suggest that LLMs maintain a latent vocabulary beyond the tokenizer's scope. These insights provide a practical, finetuning-free application for expanding the vocabulary of pre-trained models. By enabling the addition of new vocabulary words, we reduce input length and inference iterations, which reduces both space and model latency, with little to no loss in model accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Putra Manggala, Atalanti Mastakouri, Elke Kirschbaum, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, Aaditya Ramdas</p>
<p>Abstract: To use generative question-and-answering (QA) systems for decision-making and in any critical application, these systems need to provide well-calibrated confidence scores that reflect the correctness of their answers. Existing calibration methods aim to ensure that the confidence score is, *on average*, indicative of the likelihood that the answer is correct. We argue, however, that this standard (average-case) notion of calibration is difficult to interpret for decision-making in generative QA. To address this, we generalize the standard notion of average calibration and introduce QA-calibration, which ensures calibration holds across different question-and-answer groups. We then propose discretized posthoc calibration schemes for achieving QA-calibration. We establish distribution-free guarantees on the performance of this method and validate our method on confidence scores returned by elicitation prompts across multiple QA benchmarks and large language models (LLMs).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaishuai Xu, Tiezheng Yu, Wenjun Hou, Yi Cheng, Chak Tou Leong, Liangyou Li, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong mathematical reasoning prowess, tackling tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced competition-level problems. However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zonglin Yang, Wanhao Liu, Ben Gao, Tong Xie, Yuqiang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaosen Zheng, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Jing Jiang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Automatic LLM benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench, have become popular for evaluating language models due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human evaluation. Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a "null model" that always outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are private and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for reliable automatic benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Cheating-LLM-Benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheol Jun Cho, Nicholas Lee, Akshat Gupta, Dhruv Agarwal, Ethan Chen, Alan W Black, Gopala K. Anumanchipalli</p>
<p>Abstract: Syllables are compositional units of spoken language that efficiently structure human speech perception and production. However, current neural speech representations lack such structure, resulting in dense token sequences that are costly to process. To bridge this gap, we propose a new model, Sylber, that produces speech representations with clean and robust syllabic structure. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that bootstraps syllabic embeddings by distilling from its own initial unsupervised syllabic segmentation. This results in a highly structured representation of speech features, offering three key benefits: 1) a fast, linear-time syllable segmentation algorithm, 2) efficient syllabic tokenization with an average of 4.27 tokens per second, and 3) novel phonological units suited for efficient spoken language modeling. Our proposed segmentation method is highly robust and generalizes to out-of-domain data and unseen languages without any tuning. By training token-to-speech generative models, fully intelligible speech can be reconstructed from Sylber tokens with a significantly lower bitrate than baseline SSL tokens. This suggests that our model effectively compresses speech into a compact sequence of tokens with minimal information loss. Lastly, we demonstrate that categorical perception-a linguistic phenomenon in speech perception-emerges naturally in Sylber, making the embedding space more categorical and sparse than previous speech features and thus supporting the high efficiency of our tokenization. Together, we present a novel SSL approach for representing speech as syllables, with significant potential for efficient speech tokenization and spoken language modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yougang Lyu, Lingyong Yan, Zihan Wang, Dawei Yin, Pengjie Ren, Maarten de Rijke, Zhaochun Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing and achieving near-human capabilities on specific tasks, aligning them with human values is becoming more urgent. In scenarios where LLMs outperform humans, we face a weak-to-strong alignment problem where we need to effectively align strong student LLMs through weak supervision generated by weak teachers. Existing alignment methods mainly focus on strong-to-weak alignment and self-alignment settings, and it is impractical to adapt them to the much harder weak-to-strong alignment setting. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-agent contrastive preference optimization (MACPO) framework. MACPO facilitates weak teachers and strong students to learn from each other by iteratively reinforcing unfamiliar positive behaviors while penalizing familiar negative ones. To get this, we devise a mutual positive behavior augmentation strategy to encourage weak teachers and strong students to learn from each other's positive behavior and further provide higher quality positive behavior for the next iteration. Additionally, we propose a hard negative behavior construction strategy to induce weak teachers and strong students to generate familiar negative behavior by fine-tuning on negative behavioral data. Experimental results on the HH-RLHF and PKU-SafeRLHF datasets, evaluated using both automatic metrics and human judgments, demonstrate that MACPO simultaneously improves the alignment performance of strong students and weak teachers. Moreover, as the number of weak teachers increases, MACPO achieves better weak-to-strong alignment performance through more iteration optimization rounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaojian Yuan, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

<p>Abstract: Vocabulary adaptation, which integrates new vocabulary into pre-trained language models, enables expansion to new languages and mitigates token over-fragmentation. However, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on heuristics or external embeddings. We propose VocADT, a novel method for vocabulary adaptation using adapter modules that are trained to learn the optimal linear combination of existing embeddings while keeping the model's weights fixed. VocADT offers a flexible and scalable solution without depending on external resources or language constraints. Across 11 languages-with diverse scripts, resource availability, and fragmentation-we demonstrate that VocADT outperforms the original Mistral model and other baselines across various multilingual tasks including natural language understanding and machine translation. We find that Latin-script languages and highly fragmented languages benefit the most from vocabulary adaptation. We further fine-tune the adapted model on the generative task of machine translation and find that vocabulary adaptation is still beneficial after fine-tuning and that VocADT is the most effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jixuan Leng, Chengsong Huang, Banghua Zhu, Jiaxin Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model calibration refers to the alignment between the confidence of the model and the actual performance of its responses. While previous studies point out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and show that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we reveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in their own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence and demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual quality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants: PPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated Reward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model training, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment between response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the exponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly integrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. We evaluate our methods on both Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across six diverse datasets including multiple-choice and open-ended generation. Experimental results demonstrate that both of our methods can reduce calibration error and maintain performance comparable to standard PPO. We further show that they could preserve model capabilities in open-ended conversational settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangming Gu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Ye Wang, Min Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongchuan Zeng, Senyu Han, Lu Chen, Kai Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, particularly in multilingual contexts. While recent studies suggest that LLMs can transfer skills learned in one language to others, the internal mechanisms behind this ability remain unclear. We observed that the neuron activation patterns of LLMs exhibit similarities when processing the same language, revealing the existence and location of key linguistic regions. Additionally, we found that neuron activation patterns are similar when processing sentences with the same semantic meaning in different languages. This indicates that LLMs map semantically identical inputs from different languages into a "Lingua Franca", a common semantic latent space that allows for consistent processing across languages. This semantic alignment becomes more pronounced with training and increased model size, resulting in a more language-agnostic activation pattern. Moreover, we found that key linguistic neurons are concentrated in the first and last layers of LLMs, becoming denser in the first layers as training progresses. Experiments on BLOOM and LLaMA2 support these findings, highlighting the structural evolution of multilingual LLMs during training and scaling up. This paper provides insights into the internal workings of LLMs, offering a foundation for future improvements in their cross-lingual capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant potential in performing diverse tasks, including the ability to call functions or use external tools to enhance their performance. While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding function definitions are then synthesized for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maitreya Prafulla Chitale, Uday Bindal, Rajakrishnan Rajkumar, Rahul Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Summarizing movie screenplays presents a unique set of challenges compared to standard document summarization. Screenplays are not only lengthy, but also feature a complex interplay of characters, dialogues, and scenes, with numerous direct and subtle relationships and contextual nuances that are difficult for machine learning models to accurately capture and comprehend. Recent attempts at screenplay summarization focus on fine-tuning transformer-based pre-trained models, but these models often fall short in capturing long-term dependencies and latent relationships, and frequently encounter the "lost in the middle" issue. To address these challenges, we introduce DiscoGraMS, a novel resource that represents movie scripts as a movie character-aware discourse graph (CaD Graph). This approach is well-suited for various downstream tasks, such as summarization, question-answering, and salience detection. The model aims to preserve all salient information, offering a more comprehensive and faithful representation of the screenplay's content. We further explore a baseline method that combines the CaD Graph with the corresponding movie script through a late fusion of graph and text modalities, and we present very initial promising results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wanyu Du, Song Feng, James Gung, Lijia Sun, Yi Zhang, Saab Mansour, Yanjun Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing language model-based dialogue agents requires effective data to train models that can follow specific task logic. However, most existing data simulation methods focus on increasing diversity in language, topics, or dialogue acts at the utterance level, largely neglecting a critical aspect of task logic diversity at the dialogue level. This paper proposes a novel data simulation method designed to enhance the diversity of synthetic dialogues by focusing on task execution logic. Our method uses LLMs to generate decision tree-structured task plans, which enables the derivation of diverse dialogue trajectories for a given task. Each trajectory, referred to as a "dialog flow", guides the generation of a multi-turn dialogue that follows a unique trajectory. We apply this method to generate a task-oriented dialogue dataset comprising 3,886 dialogue flows across 15 different domains. We validate the effectiveness of this dataset using the next action prediction task, where models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform strong baselines, including GPT-4. Upon acceptance of this paper, we plan to release the code and data publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Baixiang Huang, Canyu Chen, Xiongxiao Xu, Ali Payani, Kai Shu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, a common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure that LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate progress in the field of knowledge editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zimo Qi, Guangliang Liu, Kristen Marie Johnson, Lu Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Though there has been intensive attention to the self-correction capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), conclusions regarding its effectiveness remain varied. In this paper, we investigate a fundamental question: is moral self-correction an innate capability in LLMs? To explore this, we conduct (1) a mechanistic analysis of how key components of self-correction, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and external feedback, interact to enable moral self-correction; and (2) a behavioral analysis of LLMs' ability to distinguish between desired and undesired outputs, introducing a self-distinguish framework. Our mechanistic analysis reveals that LLMs struggle to effectively leverage helpful feedback, and conflicts can arise between feedback and CoT reasoning. These limitations suggest that LLMs fail to identify useful contextual information, instead prioritizing their own internal knowledge. Additionally, our behavioral analysis indicates that LLMs struggle to differentiate among their own outputs. Based on these empirical findings across two analytical dimensions, mechanism and behavior, we argue that moral self-correction is not an innate capability of LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rafael Rivera Soto, Barry Chen, Nicholas Andrews</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality paraphrases are easy to produce using instruction-tuned language models or specialized paraphrasing models. Although this capability has a variety of benign applications, paraphrasing attacks$\unicode{x2013}$paraphrases applied to machine-generated texts$\unicode{x2013}$are known to significantly degrade the performance of machine-text detectors. This motivates us to consider the novel problem of paraphrase inversion, where, given paraphrased text, the objective is to recover an approximation of the original text. The closer the approximation is to the original text, the better machine-text detectors will perform. We propose an approach which frames the problem as translation from paraphrased text back to the original text, which requires examples of texts and corresponding paraphrases to train the inversion model. Fortunately, such training data can easily be generated, given a corpus of original texts and one or more paraphrasing models. We find that language models such as GPT-4 and Llama-3 exhibit biases when paraphrasing which an inversion model can learn with a modest amount of data. Perhaps surprisingly, we also find that such models generalize well, including to paraphrase models unseen at training time. Finally, we show that when combined with a paraphrased-text detector, our inversion models provide an effective defense against paraphrasing attacks, and overall our approach yields an average improvement of +22% AUROC across seven machine-text detectors and three different domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guangliang Liu, Zhiyu Xue, Xitong Zhang, Rongrong Wang, Kristen Marie Johnson</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-correction is one of the most amazing emerging capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling LLMs to self-modify an inappropriate output given a natural language feedback which describes the problems of that output. Moral self-correction is a post-hoc approach correcting unethical generations without requiring a gradient update, making it both computationally lightweight and capable of preserving the language modeling ability. Previous works have shown that LLMs can self-debias, and it has been reported that small models, i.e., those with less than 22B parameters, are not capable of moral self-correction. However, there is no direct proof as to why such smaller models fall short of moral self-correction, though previous research hypothesizes that larger models are skilled in following instructions and understanding abstract social norms. In this paper, we empirically validate this hypothesis in the context of social stereotyping, through meticulous prompting. Our experimental results indicate that (i) surprisingly, 3.8B LLMs with proper safety alignment fine-tuning can achieve very good moral self-correction performance, highlighting the significant effects of safety alignment; and (ii) small LLMs are indeed weaker than larger-scale models in terms of comprehending social norms and self-explanation through CoT, but all scales of LLMs show bad self-correction performance given unethical instructions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lizhe Fang, Yifei Wang, Zhaoyang Liu, Chenheng Zhang, Stefanie Jegelka, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Yisen Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Handling long-context inputs is crucial for large language models (LLMs) in tasks such as extended conversations, document summarization, and many-shot in-context learning. While recent approaches have extended the context windows of LLMs and employed perplexity (PPL) as a standard evaluation metric, PPL has proven unreliable for assessing long-context capabilities. The underlying cause of this limitation has remained unclear. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation for this issue. We find that PPL overlooks key tokens, which are essential for long-context understanding, by averaging across all tokens and thereby obscuring the true performance of models in long-context scenarios. To address this, we propose \textbf{LongPPL}, a novel metric that focuses on key tokens by employing a long-short context contrastive method to identify them. Our experiments demonstrate that LongPPL strongly correlates with performance on various long-context benchmarks (e.g., Pearson correlation of -0.96), significantly outperforming traditional PPL in predictive accuracy. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{LongCE} (Long-context Cross-Entropy) loss, a re-weighting strategy for fine-tuning that prioritizes key tokens, leading to consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. In summary, these contributions offer deeper insights into the limitations of PPL and present effective solutions for accurately evaluating and enhancing the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongPPL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mete Ismayilzada, Claire Stevenson, Lonneke van der Plas</p>
<p>Abstract: Story-writing is a fundamental aspect of human imagination, relying heavily on creativity to produce narratives that are novel, effective, and surprising. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative story-writing capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across 60 LLMs and 60 people using a five-sentence creative story-writing task. We use measures to automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, diversity, and linguistic complexity. We also collect creativity ratings and Turing Test classifications from non-expert and expert human raters and LLMs. Automated metrics show that LLMs generate stylistically complex stories, but tend to fall short in terms of novelty, surprise and diversity when compared to average human writers. Expert ratings generally coincide with automated metrics. However, LLMs and non-experts rate LLM stories to be more creative than human-generated stories. We discuss why and how these differences in ratings occur, and their implications for both human and artificial creativity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Tianfu Wang, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven growing demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The generic text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation, Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been implemented in many systems for syntactic ontology matching (OM). However, the lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping results. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing pipeline on syntactic OM in 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks with 49 distinct alignments. We find that Phase 1 text preprocessing (Tokenisation and Normalisation) is currently more effective than Phase 2 text preprocessing (Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation). To repair the less effective Phase 2 text preprocessing caused by unwanted false mappings, we propose a novel context-based pipeline repair approach that employs an ad hoc check to find common words that cause false mappings. These words are stored in a reserved word set and applied in text preprocessing. The experimental results show that our approach improves the matching correctness and the overall matching performance. We also discuss the integration of the classical text preprocessing pipeline with modern large language models (LLMs). We recommend that LLMs inject the text preprocessing pipeline via function calling to avoid the tendency towards unstable true mappings produced by prompt-based LLM approaches, and use LLMs to repair false mappings generated by the text preprocessing pipeline.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyuan Xu, Tanya Goyal, Eunsol Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input is a very compute-intensive inference scenario for large language models (LLMs). One prominent inference speed-up approach is to construct a smaller key-value (KV) cache, relieving LLMs from computing attention over a long sequence of tokens. While such methods work well to generate short sequences, their performance degrades rapidly for long-form generation. Most KV compression happens once, prematurely removing tokens that can be useful later in the generation. We propose a new inference method, RefreshKV, that flexibly alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens during generation. After each full attention step, we update the smaller KV cache based on the attention pattern over the entire input. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to eviction-based methods while improving performance for various long-form generation tasks. Lastly, we show that continued pretraining with our inference setting brings further gains in performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shauli Ravfogel, Anej Svete, V\'esteinn Sn{\ae}bjarnarson, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to \emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine \emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural equation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel counterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Minder, Kevin Du, Niklas Stoehr, Giovanni Monea, Chris Wendler, Robert West, Ryan Cotterell</p>
<p>Abstract: When making predictions, a language model must trade off how much it relies on its context vs. its prior knowledge. Choosing how sensitive the model is to its context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this paper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining whether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To guide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In this task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a question (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior or contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer for both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task, instruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it with high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow down which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear time algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single layer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge. Interestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find that the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model but also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally, we show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly it separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace. These results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses between context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism that controls this behavior.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in abstractive summarization tasks. However, their ability to precisely control summary attributes (e.g., length or topic) remains underexplored, limiting their adaptability to specific user preferences. In this paper, we systematically explore the controllability of LLMs. To this end, we revisit summary attribute measurements and introduce iterative evaluation metrics, failure rate and average iteration count to precisely evaluate controllability of LLMs, rather than merely assessing errors. Our findings show that LLMs struggle more with numerical attributes than with linguistic attributes. To address this challenge, we propose a guide-to-explain framework (GTE) for controllable summarization. Our GTE framework enables the model to identify misaligned attributes in the initial draft and guides it in self-explaining errors in the previous output. By allowing the model to reflect on its misalignment, GTE generates well-adjusted summaries that satisfy the desired attributes with robust effectiveness, requiring surprisingly fewer iterations than other iterative approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suramya Jadhav, Abhay Shanbhag, Amogh Thakurdesai, Ridhima Sinare, Raviraj Joshi</p>
<p>Abstract: Low-resource languages face significant challenges due to the lack of sufficient linguistic data, resources, and tools for tasks such as supervised learning, annotation, and classification. This shortage hinders the development of accurate models and datasets, making it difficult to perform critical NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or hate speech detection. To bridge this gap, Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for potential annotators, capable of generating datasets and resources for these underrepresented languages. In this paper, we focus on Marathi, a low-resource language, and evaluate the performance of both closed-source and open-source LLMs as annotators, while also comparing these results with fine-tuned BERT models. We assess models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemma 2 (2B and 9B), and Llama 3.1 (8B and 405B) on classification tasks including sentiment analysis, news classification, and hate speech detection. Our findings reveal that while LLMs excel in annotation tasks for high-resource languages like English, they still fall short when applied to Marathi. Even advanced models like GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 405B underperform compared to fine-tuned BERT-based baselines, with GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 405B trailing fine-tuned BERT by accuracy margins of 10.2% and 14.1%, respectively. This highlights the limitations of LLMs as annotators for low-resource languages.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, utilizing large language models (LLMs) for metaphor detection has achieved promising results. However, these methods heavily rely on the capabilities of closed-source LLMs, which come with relatively high inference costs and latency. To address this, we propose a method for metaphor detection by fine-tuning open-source LLMs, effectively reducing inference costs and latency with a single inference step. Furthermore, metaphor detection suffers from a severe data scarcity problem, which hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs. To tackle this, we introduce Curriculum-style Data Augmentation (CDA). Specifically, before fine-tuning, we evaluate the training data to identify correctly predicted instances for fine-tuning, while incorrectly predicted instances are used as seed data for data augmentation. This approach enables the model to quickly learn simpler knowledge and progressively acquire more complex knowledge, thereby improving performance incrementally. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all baselines. Additionally, we provide detailed ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of CDA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiawei Chen, Wentao Chen, Jing Su, Jingjing Xu, Hongyu Lin, Mengjie Ren, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant multilingual capabilities. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of these capabilities during pre-training are not well understood. In this paper, we use code LLMs as an experimental platform to explore the evolution of multilingual capabilities in LLMs during the pre-training process. Based on our observations, we propose the Babel Tower Hypothesis, which describes the entire process of LLMs acquiring new language capabilities. During the learning process, multiple languages initially share a single knowledge system dominated by the primary language and gradually develop language-specific knowledge systems. We then validate the above hypothesis by tracking the internal states of the LLMs through identifying working languages and language transferring neurons. Experimental results show that the internal state changes of the LLM are consistent with our Babel Tower Hypothesis. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to construct an optimized pre-training corpus for multilingual code LLMs, which significantly outperforms LLMs trained on the original corpus. The proposed Babel Tower Hypothesis provides new insights into designing pre-training data distributions to achieve optimal multilingual capabilities in LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiheng Xu, Dunjie Lu, Zhennan Shen, Junli Wang, Zekun Wang, Yuchen Mao, Caiming Xiong, Tao Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents can automate complex tasks across digital environments, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data for training. Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kedi Chen, Qin Chen, Jie Zhou, Xinqi Tao, Bowen Ding, Jingwen Xie, Mingchen Xie, Peilong Li, Feng Zheng, Liang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination with non-factual or unfaithful statements, which undermines the applications in real-world scenarios. Recent researches focus on uncertainty-based hallucination detection, which utilizes the output probability of LLMs for uncertainty calculation and does not rely on external knowledge or frequent sampling from LLMs. Whereas, most approaches merely consider the uncertainty of each independent token, while the intricate semantic relations among tokens and sentences are not well studied, which limits the detection of hallucination that spans over multiple tokens and sentences in the passage. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance uncertainty modeling with semantic graph for hallucination detection. Specifically, we first construct a semantic graph that well captures the relations among entity tokens and sentences. Then, we incorporate the relations between two entities for uncertainty propagation to enhance sentence-level hallucination detection. Given that hallucination occurs due to the conflict between sentences, we further present a graph-based uncertainty calibration method that integrates the contradiction probability of the sentence with its neighbors in the semantic graph for uncertainty calculation. Extensive experiments on two datasets show the great advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, we obtain substantial improvements with 19.78% in passage-level hallucination detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Benjamin Reichman, Xiaofan Yu, Lanxiang Hu, Jack Truxal, Atishay Jain, Rushil Chandrupatla, Tajana \v{S}imuni\'c Rosing, Larry Heck</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth in sensor data, effectively interpreting and interfacing with these data in a human-understandable way has become crucial. While existing research primarily focuses on learning classification models, fewer studies have explored how end users can actively extract useful insights from sensor data, often hindered by the lack of a proper dataset. To address this gap, we introduce SensorQA, the first human-created question-answering (QA) dataset for long-term time-series sensor data for daily life monitoring. SensorQA is created by human workers and includes 5.6K diverse and practical queries that reflect genuine human interests, paired with accurate answers derived from sensor data. We further establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art AI models on this dataset and evaluate their performance on typical edge devices. Our results reveal a gap between current models and optimal QA performance and efficiency, highlighting the need for new contributions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vighnesh Subramaniam, Yilun Du, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Antonio Torralba, Shuang Li, Igor Mordatch</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in recent years but are fundamentally limited by the underlying training data. To improve models beyond the training data, recent works have explored how LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for autonomous self-improvement. However, successive steps of self-improvement can reach a point of diminishing returns. In this work, we propose a complementary approach towards self-improvement where finetuning is applied to a multiagent society of language models. A group of language models, all starting from the same base model, are independently specialized by updating each one using data generated through multiagent interactions among the models. By training each model on independent sets of data, we illustrate how this approach enables specialization across models and diversification over the set of models. As a result, our overall system is able to preserve diverse reasoning chains and autonomously improve over many more rounds of fine-tuning than single-agent self-improvement methods. We quantitatively illustrate the efficacy of the approach across a wide suite of reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Toker, Ido Galil, Hadas Orgad, Rinon Gal, Yoad Tewel, Gal Chechik, Yonatan Belinkov</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models rely on encoded prompts to guide the image generation process. Typically, these prompts are extended to a fixed length by adding padding tokens before text encoding. Despite being a default practice, the influence of padding tokens on the image generation process has not been investigated. In this work, we conduct the first in-depth analysis of the role padding tokens play in T2I models. We develop two causal techniques to analyze how information is encoded in the representation of tokens across different components of the T2I pipeline. Using these techniques, we investigate when and how padding tokens impact the image generation process. Our findings reveal three distinct scenarios: padding tokens may affect the model's output during text encoding, during the diffusion process, or be effectively ignored. Moreover, we identify key relationships between these scenarios and the model's architecture (cross or self-attention) and its training process (frozen or trained text encoder). These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of padding tokens, potentially informing future model design and training practices in T2I systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: The claim matching (CM) task can benefit an automated fact-checking pipeline by putting together claims that can be resolved with the same fact-check. In this work, we are the first to explore zero-shot and few-shot learning approaches to the task. We consider CM as a binary classification task and experiment with a set of instruction-following large language models (GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-flash, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and Llama-3-8B-Instruct), investigating prompt templates. We introduce a new CM dataset, ClaimMatch, which will be released upon acceptance. We put LLMs to the test in the CM task and find that it can be tackled by leveraging more mature yet similar tasks such as natural language inference or paraphrase detection. We also propose a pipeline for CM, which we evaluate on texts of different lengths.</p>

To address this, we propose AdEval (Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation), a dynamic data evaluation method aimed at mitigating the impact of data contamination on evaluation reliability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sullam Jeoung, Yubin Ge, Haohan Wang, Jana Diesner</p>
<p>Abstract: Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, e.g., when LLMs fail to operate as intended. This study examines the alignment of LLMs with human values for the domain of politics. Prior research has shown that LLM-generated outputs can include political leanings and mimic the stances of political parties on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions are insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we analyze the factors that contribute to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them.
  Drawing on findings from cognitive science about representativeness heuristics, i.e., situations where humans lean on representative attributes of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs, we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics' lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs inflate predictions about political parties, which results in stereotyping. We find that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human survey respondents do. Also, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness more than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggesting a potential vulnerability of LLMs that facilitates political stereotyping. We also test prompt-based mitigation strategies, finding that strategies that can mitigate representative heuristics in humans are also effective in reducing the influence of representativeness on LLM-generated responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1-32B exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1-32B with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24.

<p>Abstract: To deliver coherent and personalized experiences in long-term conversations, existing approaches typically perform retrieval augmented response generation by constructing memory banks from conversation history at either the turn-level, session-level, or through summarization techniques.In this paper, we present two key findings: (1) The granularity of memory unit matters: turn-level, session-level, and summarization-based methods each exhibit limitations in both memory retrieval accuracy and the semantic quality of the retrieved content. (2) Prompt compression methods, such as LLMLingua-2, can effectively serve as a denoising mechanism, enhancing memory retrieval accuracy across different granularities. Building on these insights, we propose SeCom, a method that constructs the memory bank at segment level by introducing a conversation segmentation model that partitions long-term conversations into topically coherent segments, while applying compression based denoising on memory units to enhance memory retrieval. Experimental results show that SeCom exhibits a significant performance advantage over baselines on long-term conversation benchmarks LOCOMO and Long-MT-Bench+. Additionally, the proposed conversation segmentation method demonstrates superior performance on dialogue segmentation datasets such as DialSeg711, TIAGE, and SuperDialSeg.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chengwen Qi, Ren Ma, Bowen Li, He Du, Binyuan Hui, Jinwang Wu, Yuanjun Laili, Conghui He</p>
<p>Abstract: First-order logic (FOL) reasoning, which involves sequential deduction, is pivotal for intelligent systems and serves as a valuable task for evaluating reasoning capabilities, particularly in chain-of-thought (CoT) contexts. Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework. The finetuned model demonstrates consistent improvements on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting the value of our proposed data generation framework.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyi Huang, Zeqiu Xu, Peiyang Yu, Jingyuan Yi, Xiaochuan Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose an optimized Transformer model that integrates Bayesian algorithms with a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), and apply it to fake news classification for the first time. First, we employ the TF-IDF method to extract features from news texts and transform them into numeric representations to facilitate subsequent machine learning tasks. Two sets of experiments are then conducted for fake news detection and classification: one using a Transformer model optimized only with BiGRU, and the other incorporating Bayesian algorithms into the BiGRU-based Transformer. Experimental results show that the BiGRU-optimized Transformer achieves 100% accuracy on the training set and 99.67% on the test set, while the addition of the Bayesian algorithm maintains 100% accuracy on the training set and slightly improves test-set accuracy to 99.73%. This indicates that the Bayesian algorithm boosts model accuracy by 0.06%, further enhancing the detection capability for fake news. Moreover, the proposed algorithm converges rapidly at around the 10th training epoch with accuracy nearing 100%, demonstrating both its effectiveness and its fast classification ability. Overall, the optimized Transformer model, enhanced by the Bayesian algorithm and BiGRU, exhibits excellent continuous learning and detection performance, offering a robust technical means to combat the spread of fake news in the current era of information overload.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Finlayson, Ilia Kulikov, Daniel M. Bikel, Barlas Oguz, Xilun Chen, Aasish Pappu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiujie Xie, Qingqiu Li, Zhuohao Yu, Yuejie Zhang, Yue Zhang, Linyi Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: As LLM-as-a-Judge emerges as a new paradigm for assessing large language models (LLMs), concerns have been raised regarding the alignment, bias, and stability of LLM evaluators. While substantial work has focused on alignment and bias, little research has concentrated on the stability of LLM evaluators. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments involving 9 widely used LLM evaluators across 2 different evaluation settings to investigate the uncertainty in model-based LLM evaluations. We pinpoint that LLM evaluators exhibit varying uncertainty based on model families and sizes. With careful comparative analyses, we find that employing special prompting strategies, whether during inference or post-training, can alleviate evaluation uncertainty to some extent. By utilizing uncertainty to enhance LLM's reliability and detection capability in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, we further fine-tune an uncertainty-aware LLM evaluator named ConfiLM using a human-annotated fine-tuning set and assess ConfiLM's OOD evaluation ability on a manually designed test set sourced from the 2024 Olympics. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating uncertainty as additional information during the fine-tuning phase can largely improve the model's evaluation performance in OOD scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongwu Xu, Xiaojian Li, Shuo Chen, Wei Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous decision-makers, raising concerns about catastrophic risks in high-stakes scenarios, particularly in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) domains. Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents. We will release our code upon request.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wujiang Xu, Zujie Liang, Kai Mei, Hang Gao, Juntao Tan, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines. The source code is available at https://github.com/WujiangXu/AgenticMemory.</p>

We propose two techniques to enhance the encoder's contrastive training process: augmenting job data with hypothetical reference resume generated by a large language model; and creating high-quality hard negatives from unlabeled resume/job pairs using a novel hard-negative mining strategy. We evaluate ConFit v2 on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms ConFit and prior methods (including BM25 and OpenAI text-embedding-003), achieving an average absolute improvement of 13.8% in recall and 17.5% in nDCG across job-ranking and resume-ranking tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanzheng Chen, Xin Li, Michael Qizhe Shieh, Lidong Bing</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities through pretraining and alignment. However, superior short-context LLMs may underperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context alignment. This alignment process remains challenging due to the impracticality of human annotation for extended contexts and the difficulty in balancing short- and long-context performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context tasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses LLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising paired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs and their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference reveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context alignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios. Additionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate short-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully retains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in both long- and short-context tasks. Specifically, LongPO-trained models can achieve results on long-context benchmarks comparable to, or even surpassing, those of superior LLMs (e.g., GPT-4-128K) that involve extensive long-context annotation and larger parameter scales.

<p>Abstract: Natural language interaction with agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), is expected to remain a dominant paradigm in the near future. While humans instinctively align their communication with mental states -- an ability known as Theory of Mind (ToM), current LLM powered systems exhibit significant limitations in this regard. This study examines the extent to which open source language models (LLaMA) can capture and preserve ToM related information and how effectively it contributes to consistent ToM reasoning in generated responses. We further investigate whether explicit manipulation of ToM related components, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, can enhance response alignment. Experiments on two LLaMA 3 variants demonstrate that incorporating ToM informed alignment improves response quality, achieving win rates of 67 and 63 percent for the 3B and 8B models, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of ToM driven strategies to improve alignment in LLM based conversational agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hajar Sakai, Sarah S. Lam</p>
<p>Abstract: The escalating volume of collected healthcare textual data presents a unique challenge for automated Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC), which is primarily due to the scarcity of annotated texts for training and their nuanced nature. Traditional machine learning models often fail to fully capture the array of expressed topics. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in various domains, which show impressive computational efficiency and suitability for unsupervised learning through prompt engineering. Consequently, these LLMs promise an effective MLTC of medical narratives. However, when dealing with various labels, different prompts can be relevant depending on the topic. To address these challenges, the proposed approach, QUAD-LLM-MLTC, leverages the strengths of four LLMs: GPT-4o, BERT, PEGASUS, and BART. QUAD-LLM-MLTC operates in a sequential pipeline in which BERT extracts key tokens, PEGASUS augments textual data, GPT-4o classifies, and BART provides topics' assignment probabilities, which results in four classifications, all in a 0-shot setting. The outputs are then combined using ensemble learning and processed through a meta-classifier to produce the final MLTC result. The approach is evaluated using three samples of annotated texts, which contrast it with traditional and single-model methods. The results show significant improvements across the majority of the topics in the classification's F1 score and consistency (F1 and Micro-F1 scores of 78.17% and 80.16% with standard deviations of 0.025 and 0.011, respectively). This research advances MLTC using LLMs and provides an efficient and scalable solution to rapidly categorize healthcare-related text data without further training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Govind Pimpale, Axel H{\o}jmark, J\'er\'emy Scheurer, Marius Hobbhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: As Language Models (LMs) increasingly operate as autonomous agents, accurately forecasting their capabilities becomes crucial for societal preparedness. We evaluate six forecasting methods that predict downstream capabilities of LM agents. We use "one-step" approaches that predict benchmark scores from input metrics like compute or model release date directly or "two-step" approaches that first predict an intermediate metric like the principal component of cross-benchmark performance (PC-1) and human-evaluated competitive Elo ratings. We evaluate our forecasting methods by backtesting them on a dataset of 38 LMs from the OpenLLM 2 leaderboard. We then use the validated two-step approach (Release Date$\to$Elo$\to$Benchmark) to predict LM agent performance for frontier models on three benchmarks: SWE-Bench Verified (software development), Cybench (cybersecurity assessment), and RE-Bench (ML research engineering). Our forecast predicts that by the beginning of 2026, non-specialized LM agents with low capability elicitation will reach a success rate of 54% on SWE-Bench Verified, while state-of-the-art LM agents will reach an 87% success rate. Our approach does not account for recent advances in inference-compute scaling and might thus be too conservative.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh Duc Le, Tu Vu, Nam Le Hai, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Diep, Linh Ngo Van, Trung Le, Thien Huu Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks but face deployment challenges due to high computational costs and memory constraints. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution, transferring knowledge from large teacher models to smaller student models. However, existing KD methods often assume shared vocabularies and tokenizers, limiting their flexibility. While approaches like Universal Logit Distillation (ULD) and Dual-Space Knowledge Distillation (DSKD) address vocabulary mismatches, they overlook the critical \textbf{reasoning-aware distillation} aspect. To bridge this gap, we propose CoT2Align a universal KD framework that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) augmentation and introduces Cross-CoT Alignment to enhance reasoning transfer. Additionally, we extend Optimal Transport beyond token-wise alignment to a sequence-level and layer-wise alignment approach that adapts to varying sequence lengths while preserving contextual integrity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoT2Align outperforms existing KD methods across different vocabulary settings, improving reasoning capabilities and robustness in domain-specific tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yepeng Weng, Dianwen Mei, Huishi Qiu, Xujie Chen, Li Liu, Jiang Tian, Zhongchao Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging a lightweight speculative draft model. However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Zeng, Qianyu He, Qingyu Ren, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Weikang Zhou, Zeye Sun, Fei Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world instructions with multiple constraints pose a significant challenge to existing large language models (LLMs). An observation is that the LLMs exhibit dramatic performance fluctuation when disturbing the order of the incorporated constraints. Yet, none of the existing works has systematically investigated this position bias problem in the field of multi-constraint instruction following. To bridge this gap, we design a probing task where we quantitatively measure the difficulty distribution of the constraints by a novel Difficulty Distribution Index (CDDI). Through the experimental results, we find that LLMs are more performant when presented with the constraints in a ``hard-to-easy'' order. This preference can be generalized to LLMs with different architecture or different sizes of parameters. Additionally, we conduct an explanation study, providing an intuitive insight into the correlation between the LLM's attention and constraint orders.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxuan Li, Hirokazu Shirado</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models demonstrate advanced problem-solving capabilities by incorporating reasoning techniques such as chain of thought and reflection. However, how these reasoning capabilities extend to social intelligence remains unclear. In this study, we investigate this question using economic games that model social dilemmas, where social intelligence plays a crucial role. First, we examine the effects of chain-of-thought and reflection techniques in a public goods game. We then extend our analysis to six economic games on cooperation and punishment, comparing off-the-shelf non-reasoning and reasoning models. We find that reasoning models significantly reduce cooperation and norm enforcement, prioritizing individual rationality. Consequently, groups with more reasoning models exhibit less cooperation and lower gains through repeated interactions. These behaviors parallel human tendencies of "spontaneous giving and calculated greed." Our results suggest the need for AI architectures that incorporate social intelligence alongside reasoning capabilities to ensure that AI supports, rather than disrupts, human cooperative intuition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiqi Yan, Xiquan Li, Wenxi Chen, Zhikang Niu, Chen Yang, Ziyang Ma, Kai Yu, Xie Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, with advances in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end spoken dialogue models (SDMs) have made significant strides. Compared to text-based LLMs, the evaluation of SDMs needs to take speech-related aspects into account, such as paralinguistic information and speech quality. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluations for SDMs in speech-to-speech (S2S) scenarios. To address this gap, we propose URO-Bench, an extensive benchmark for SDMs. Notably, URO-Bench is the first S2S benchmark that covers evaluations about multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics. Our benchmark is divided into two difficulty levels: basic track and pro track, consisting of 16 and 20 datasets respectively, evaluating the model's abilities in Understanding, Reasoning, and Oral conversation. Evaluations on our proposed benchmark reveal that current open-source SDMs perform rather well in daily QA tasks, but lag behind their backbone LLMs in terms of instruction-following ability and also suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Their performance in advanced evaluations of paralinguistic information and audio understanding remains subpar, highlighting the need for further research in this direction. We hope that URO-Bench can effectively facilitate the development of spoken dialogue models by providing a multifaceted evaluation of existing models and helping to track progress in this area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the fact-checking studies. However, existing automated fact-checking evaluation methods rely on static datasets and classification metrics, which fail to automatically evaluate the justification production and uncover the nuanced limitations of LLMs in fact-checking. In this work, we introduce FACT-AUDIT, an agent-driven framework that adaptively and dynamically assesses LLMs' fact-checking capabilities. Leveraging importance sampling principles and multi-agent collaboration, FACT-AUDIT generates adaptive and scalable datasets, performs iterative model-centric evaluations, and updates assessments based on model-specific responses. By incorporating justification production alongside verdict prediction, this framework provides a comprehensive and evolving audit of LLMs' factual reasoning capabilities, to investigate their trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FACT-AUDIT effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LLMs, providing valuable insights into model strengths and limitations in model-centric fact-checking analysis.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLM Ensemble -- which involves the comprehensive use of multiple large language models (LLMs), each aimed at handling user queries during downstream inference, to benefit from their individual strengths -- has gained substantial attention recently. The widespread availability of LLMs, coupled with their varying strengths and out-of-the-box usability, has profoundly advanced the field of LLM Ensemble. This paper presents the first systematic review of recent developments in LLM Ensemble. First, we introduce our taxonomy of LLM Ensemble and discuss several related research problems. Then, we provide a more in-depth classification of the methods under the broad categories of "ensemble-before-inference, ensemble-during-inference, ensemble-after-inference'', and review all relevant methods. Finally, we introduce related benchmarks and applications, summarize existing studies, and suggest several future research directions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Silei Xu, Wenhao Xie, Lingxiao Zhao, Pengcheng He</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving complex reasoning tasks through mechanisms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which emphasizes verbose, step-by-step reasoning. However, humans typically employ a more efficient strategy: drafting concise intermediate thoughts that capture only essential information. In this work, we propose Chain of Draft (CoD), a novel paradigm inspired by human cognitive processes, where LLMs generate minimalistic yet informative intermediate reasoning outputs while solving tasks. By reducing verbosity and focusing on critical insights, CoD matches or surpasses CoT in accuracy while using as little as only 7.6% of the tokens, significantly reducing cost and latency across various reasoning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaishuai Xu, Tiezheng Yu, Wenjun Hou, Yi Cheng, Liangyou Li, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Wenjie Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used more and more extensively for automated evaluation in various scenarios. Previous studies have attempted to fine-tune open-source LLMs to replicate the evaluation explanations and judgments of powerful proprietary models, such as GPT-4. However, these methods are largely limited to text-based analyses under predefined general criteria, resulting in reduced adaptability for unseen instructions and demonstrating instability in evaluating adherence to quantitative and structural constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a novel evaluation framework, ARJudge, that adaptively formulates evaluation criteria and synthesizes both text-based and code-driven analyses to evaluate LLM responses. ARJudge consists of two components: a fine-tuned Analyzer that generates multi-faceted evaluation analyses and a tuning-free Refiner that combines and refines all analyses to make the final judgment. We construct a Composite Analysis Corpus that integrates tasks for evaluation criteria generation alongside text-based and code-driven analysis generation to train the Analyzer. Our results demonstrate that ARJudge outperforms existing fine-tuned evaluators in effectiveness and robustness. Furthermore, it demonstrates the importance of multi-faceted evaluation and code-driven analyses in enhancing evaluation capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite its real-world significance, model performance on tabular data remains underexplored, leaving uncertainty about which model to rely on and which prompt configuration to adopt. To address this gap, we create ToRR, a benchmark for Table Reasoning and Robustness, measuring model performance and robustness on table-related tasks. The benchmark includes 10 datasets that cover different types of table reasoning capabilities across varied domains. ToRR goes beyond model performance rankings, and is designed to reflect whether models can handle tabular data consistently and robustly, across a variety of common table representation formats. We present a leaderboard as well as comprehensive analyses of the results of leading models over ToRR. Our results reveal a striking pattern of brittle model behavior, where even strong models are unable to perform robustly on tabular data tasks. Although no specific table format leads to consistently better performance, we show that testing over multiple formats is crucial for reliably estimating model capabilities. Moreover, we show that the reliability boost from testing multiple prompts can be equivalent to adding more test examples. Overall, our findings show that table understanding and reasoning tasks remain a significant challenge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yash Mahajan, Matthew Freestone, Sathyanarayanan Aakur, Santu Karmaker</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable advancement in various NLP tasks. As such, a popular trend has emerged lately where NLP researchers extract word/sentence/document embeddings from these large decoder-only models and use them for various inference tasks with promising results. However, it is still unclear whether the performance improvement of LLM-induced embeddings is merely because of scale or whether underlying embeddings they produce significantly differ from classical encoding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) or Universal Sentence Encoder (USE). This is the central question we investigate in the paper by systematically comparing classical decontextualized and contextualized word embeddings with the same for LLM-induced embeddings. Our results show that LLMs cluster semantically related words more tightly and perform better on analogy tasks in decontextualized settings. However, in contextualized settings, classical models like SimCSE often outperform LLMs in sentence-level similarity assessment tasks, highlighting their continued relevance for fine-grained semantics.</p>

While traditional optimization approaches like pruning and quantization often compromise model quality, recent advances in generation-refinement frameworks demonstrate that this trade-off can be significantly mitigated.
  This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of generation-refinement frameworks, analyzing methods across autoregressive sequence tasks. We categorize methods based on their generation strategies (from simple n-gram prediction to sophisticated draft models) and refinement mechanisms (including single-pass verification and iterative approaches). Through systematic analysis of both algorithmic innovations and system-level implementations, we examine deployment strategies across computing environments and explore applications spanning text, images, and speech generation. This systematic examination of both theoretical frameworks and practical implementations provides a foundation for future research in efficient autoregressive decoding.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs in reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1, incorporating inference-time reasoning into machine translation (MT), where human translators naturally employ structured, multi-layered reasoning chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), is yet underexplored. Existing methods either design a fixed CoT tailored for a specific MT sub-task (e.g., literature translation), or rely on synthesizing CoTs unaligned with humans, limiting their adaptability to diverse translation scenarios. This paper introduces R1-Translator (R1-T1), a novel framework to achieve inference-time reasoning for general MT via reinforcement learning (RL) with human-aligned CoTs comprising six common patterns. Our approach pioneers three innovations: (1) extending reasoning-based translation beyond MT sub-tasks to six languages and diverse tasks (e.g., legal/medical domain adaptation, idiom resolution); (2) formalizing six expert-curated CoT templates that mirror hybrid human strategies like context-aware paraphrasing and back translation; and (3) enabling self-evolving CoT discovery through RL. Experimental results indicate a steady translation performance improvement in 11 languages and 40 translation directions on Flores-101 test set, especially on the languages unseen from training.</p>

<p>Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques have emerged as essential tools for updating the factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs), allowing them to correct outdated or inaccurate information without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for multimodal knowledge editing primarily focus on entity-level knowledge represented as simple triplets, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world multimodal information. To address this issue, we introduce MMKE-Bench, a comprehensive MultiModal Knowledge Editing Benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to edit diverse visual knowledge in real-world scenarios. MMKE-Bench addresses these limitations by incorporating three types of editing tasks: visual entity editing, visual semantic editing, and user-specific editing. Besides, MMKE-Bench uses free-form natural language to represent and edit knowledge, offering a more flexible and effective format. The benchmark consists of 2,940 pieces of knowledge and 8,363 images across 33 broad categories, with evaluation questions automatically generated and human-verified. We assess five state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods on three prominent LMMs, revealing that no method excels across all criteria, and that visual and user-specific edits are particularly challenging. MMKE-Bench sets a new standard for evaluating the robustness of multimodal knowledge editing techniques, driving progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

<p>Abstract: To achieve equitable performance across languages, multilingual large language models (LLMs) must be able to abstract knowledge beyond the language in which it was acquired. However, the current literature lacks reliable ways to measure LLMs' capability of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. To that end, we present ECLeKTic, a multilingual closed-book QA (CBQA) dataset that Evaluates Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer in a simple, black-box manner. We detected information with uneven coverage across languages by controlling for presence and absence of Wikipedia articles in 12 languages. We generated knowledge-seeking questions in a source language, for which the answer appears in a relevant Wikipedia article and translated them to all other 11 languages, for which the respective Wikipedias lack equivalent articles. Assuming that Wikipedia reflects the prominent knowledge in the LLM's training data, to solve ECLeKTic's CBQA task the model is required to transfer knowledge between languages. Experimenting with 8 LLMs, we show that SOTA models struggle to effectively share knowledge across, languages even if they can predict the answer well for queries in the same language the knowledge was acquired in.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we identify and characterize the emerging area of representation engineering (RepE), an approach to enhancing the transparency of AI systems that draws on insights from cognitive neuroscience. RepE places population-level representations, rather than neurons or circuits, at the center of analysis, equipping us with novel methods for monitoring and manipulating high-level cognitive phenomena in deep neural networks (DNNs). We provide baselines and an initial analysis of RepE techniques, showing that they offer simple yet effective solutions for improving our understanding and control of large language models. We showcase how these methods can provide traction on a wide range of safety-relevant problems, including honesty, harmlessness, power-seeking, and more, demonstrating the promise of top-down transparency research. We hope that this work catalyzes further exploration of RepE and fosters advancements in the transparency and safety of AI systems.</p>

This practice, where individuals frequently mix two or more languages in their daily interactions, is particularly prevalent in multilingual regions such as Hong Kong, China. To bridge this gap, we have developed a 34.8-hour dataset of Mixed Cantonese and English (MCE) audio using our Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework (MADGF). We fine-tuned the open-source multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, Whisper, with the MCE dataset, leading to impressive zero-shot performance. The traditional metrics overlook important factors such as latency in real-world applications and code-switching scenarios. We have introduced a novel evaluation metric called Fidelity to the Original Audio, Accuracy, and Latency (FAL). This metric aims to overcome the limitations of traditional metrics used to assess ASR systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chinmay Mittal, Krishna Kartik,  Mausam, Parag Singla</p>
<p>Abstract: Can the large language models (LLMs) solve challenging first-order combinatorial reasoning problems such as graph coloring, knapsack, and cryptarithmetic? By first-order, we mean these problems can be instantiated with potentially an infinite number of problem instances of varying sizes. They are also challenging being NP-hard and requiring several reasoning steps to reach a solution. While existing work has focused on coming up with datasets with hard benchmarks, there is limited work which exploits the first-order nature of the problem structure. To address this challenge, we present FCoReBench, a dataset of 40 such challenging problems, along with scripts to generate problem instances of varying sizes and automatically verify and generate their solutions. We first observe that LLMs, even when aided by symbolic solvers, perform rather poorly on our dataset, being unable to leverage the underlying structure of these problems. We specifically observe a drop in performance with increasing problem size. In response, we propose a new approach, SymPro-LM, which combines LLMs with both symbolic solvers and program interpreters, along with feedback from a few solved examples, to achieve huge performance gains. Our proposed approach is robust to changes in the problem size, and has the unique characteristic of not requiring any LLM call during inference time, unlike earlier approaches. As an additional experiment, we also demonstrate SymPro-LM's effectiveness on other logical reasoning benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ji Qi, Ming Ding, Weihan Wang, Yushi Bai, Qingsong Lv, Wenyi Hong, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated their broad effectiveness thanks to extensive training in aligning visual instructions to responses. However, such training of conclusive alignment leads models to ignore essential visual reasoning, further resulting in failures in meticulous visual problems and unfaithful responses. Drawing inspiration from human cognition in solving visual problems (e.g., marking, zoom in), this paper introduces Chain of Manipulations, a mechanism that enables VLMs to solve problems step-by-step with evidence. After training, models can solve various visual problems by eliciting intrinsic manipulations (e.g., grounding, zoom in) with results (e.g., boxes, image) actively without involving external tools, while also allowing users to trace error causes. We study the roadmap to implement this mechanism, including (1) a flexible design of manipulations upon extensive analysis, (2) an efficient automated data generation pipeline, (3) a compatible VLM architecture capable of multi-turn multi-image, and (4) a model training process for versatile capabilities. With the design, we also manually annotate 6K high-quality samples for the challenging graphical mathematical problems. Our trained model, \textbf{CogCoM}, equipped with this mechanism with 17B parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance across 9 benchmarks from 4 categories, demonstrating the effectiveness while preserving the interpretability.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pengzhou Cheng, Wei Du, Zongru Wu, Fengwei Zhang, Libo Chen, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Although pre-training achieves remarkable performance, it suffers from task-agnostic backdoor attacks due to vulnerabilities in data and training mechanisms. These attacks can transfer backdoors to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$, an entropy-based poisoning filter that mitigates such risks. To overcome the limitations of manual target setting and explicit triggers, we propose $\mathtt{SynGhost}$, an invisible and universal task-agnostic backdoor attack via syntactic transfer, further exposing vulnerabilities in pre-trained language models (PLMs). Specifically, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ injects multiple syntactic backdoors into the pre-training space through corpus poisoning, while preserving the PLM's pre-training capabilities. Second, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ adaptively selects optimal targets based on contrastive learning, creating a uniform distribution in the pre-training space. To identify syntactic differences, we also introduce an awareness module to minimize interference between backdoors. Experiments show that $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ poses significant threats and can transfer to various downstream tasks. Furthermore, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ resists defenses based on perplexity, fine-pruning, and $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$. The code is available at https://github.com/Zhou-CyberSecurity-AI/SynGhost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yikun Zhang, Geyan Ye, Chaohao Yuan, Bo Han, Long-Kai Huang, Jianhua Yao, Wei Liu, Yu Rong</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecule-and-text cross-modal representation learning has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the quality of molecular representation, thereby improving performance in various scientific fields. However, most approaches employ a global alignment approach to learn the knowledge from different modalities that may fail to capture fine-grained information, such as molecule-and-text fragments and stereoisomeric nuances, which is crucial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, it is incapable of modeling such information using a similar global alignment strategy due to the lack of annotations about the fine-grained fragments in the existing dataset. In this paper, we propose Atomas, a hierarchical molecular representation learning framework that jointly learns representations from SMILES strings and text. We design a Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model to automatically learn the fine-grained fragment correspondence between two modalities and align these representations at three semantic levels. Atomas's end-to-end training framework supports understanding and generating molecules, enabling a wider range of downstream tasks. Atomas achieves superior performance across 12 tasks on 11 datasets, outperforming 11 baseline models thus highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of our method. Scaling experiments further demonstrate Atomas's robustness and scalability. Moreover, visualization and qualitative analysis, validated by human experts, confirm the chemical relevance of our approach. Codes are released on https://github.com/yikunpku/Atomas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihao Zhang, Zeming Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably the well-known jailbreak attack. In particular, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack has demonstrated efficacy in exploiting this vulnerability by optimizing adversarial prompts through a combination of gradient heuristics and greedy search. However, the efficiency of this attack has become a bottleneck in the attacking process. To mitigate this limitation, in this paper we rethink the generation of the adversarial prompts through an optimization lens, aiming to stabilize the optimization process and harness more heuristic insights from previous optimization iterations. Specifically, we propose the \textbf{M}omentum \textbf{A}ccelerated G\textbf{C}G (\textbf{MAC}) attack, which integrates a momentum term into the gradient heuristic to boost and stabilize the random search for tokens in adversarial prompts. Experimental results showcase the notable enhancement achieved by MAC over baselines in terms of attack success rate and optimization efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that MAC can still exhibit superior performance for transfer attacks and models under defense mechanisms.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yueen Ma, Zixing Song, Yuzheng Zhuang, Jianye Hao, Irwin King</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nadav Timor, Jonathan Mamou, Daniel Korat, Moshe Berchansky, Oren Pereg, Moshe Wasserblat, Tomer Galanti, Michal Gordon, David Harel</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces distributed speculative inference (DSI), a novel inference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI) [leviathan2023, chen2023, miao2024, sun2025, timor2025] and standard autoregressive inference (non-SI). Like other SI algorithms, DSI operates on frozen language models (LMs), requiring no training or architectural modifications, and it preserves the target distribution. Prior studies on SI have demonstrated empirical speedups over non-SI--but rely on sufficiently fast and accurate drafters, which are often unavailable in practice. We identify a gap where SI can be slower than non-SI if drafters are too slow or inaccurate. We close this gap by proving that DSI is faster than both SI and non-SI--given any drafters. DSI is therefore not only faster than SI, but also unlocks the acceleration of LMs for which SI fails. DSI leverages speculation parallelism (SP), a novel type of task parallelism, to orchestrate target and drafter instances that overlap in time, establishing a new foundational tradeoff between computational resources and latency. Our simulations show that DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI in single-node setups for various off-the-shelf LMs and tasks. We open-source all our code.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Fisch, Jacob Eisenstein, Vicky Zayats, Alekh Agarwal, Ahmad Beirami, Chirag Nagpal, Pete Shaw, Jonathan Berant</p>
<p>Abstract: Language model (LM) post-training (or alignment) involves maximizing a reward function that is derived from preference annotations. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a popular offline alignment method that trains a policy directly on preference data without the need to train a reward model or apply reinforcement learning. However, the empirical evidence suggests that DPO typically assigns implicit rewards that overfit, and trend towards infinite magnitude. This frequently leads to degenerate policies, sometimes causing even the probabilities of the preferred generations to go to zero. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and use distillation to get a better proxy for the true preference distribution over generation pairs: we train the LM such that its induced implicit reward, i.e., the scaled log-likelihood ratio of the model to the reference model, matches an explicit reward model trained on the preference data. Moreover, to account for uncertainty in the reward model we are distilling from, we optimize against a family of reward models that, as a whole, is likely to include at least one reasonable proxy for the preference distribution. Our results show that distilling from such a family of reward models leads to improved robustness to distribution shift in preference annotations, while preserving the simple supervised nature of DPO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Basile, Santiago Acevedo, Luca Bortolussi, Fabio Anselmi, Alex Rodriguez</p>
<p>Abstract: To gain insight into the mechanisms behind machine learning methods, it is crucial to establish connections among the features describing data points. However, these correlations often exhibit a high-dimensional and strongly nonlinear nature, which makes them challenging to detect using standard methods. This paper exploits the entanglement between intrinsic dimensionality and correlation to propose a metric that quantifies the (potentially nonlinear) correlation between high-dimensional manifolds. We first validate our method on synthetic data in controlled environments, showcasing its advantages and drawbacks compared to existing techniques. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to large-scale applications in neural network representations. Specifically, we focus on latent representations of multimodal data, uncovering clear correlations between paired visual and textual embeddings, whereas existing methods struggle significantly in detecting similarity. Our results indicate the presence of highly nonlinear correlation patterns between latent manifolds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Susan Athey, Herman Brunborg, Tianyu Du, Ayush Kanodia, Keyon Vafa</p>
<p>Abstract: Vafa et al. (2024) introduced a transformer-based econometric model, CAREER, that predicts a worker's next job as a function of career history (an "occupation model"). CAREER was initially estimated ("pre-trained") using a large, unrepresentative resume dataset, which served as a "foundation model," and parameter estimation was continued ("fine-tuned") using data from a representative survey. CAREER had better predictive performance than benchmarks. This paper considers an alternative where the resume-based foundation model is replaced by a large language model (LLM). We convert tabular data from the survey into text files that resemble resumes and fine-tune the LLMs using these text files with the objective to predict the next token (word). The resulting fine-tuned LLM is used as an input to an occupation model. Its predictive performance surpasses all prior models. We demonstrate the value of fine-tuning and further show that by adding more career data from a different population, fine-tuning smaller LLMs surpasses the performance of fine-tuning larger models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuheng Zhang, Dian Yu, Baolin Peng, Linfeng Song, Ye Tian, Mingyue Huo, Nan Jiang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent RLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In this paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach it from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a two-player game and propose a novel online algorithm, iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no-regret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods, INPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead, we introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an LLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 42.6% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 37.8% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art online RLHF algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aliyah R. Hsu, Georgia Zhou, Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri, Yaxuan Huang, Anobel Y. Odisho, Peter R. Carroll, Bin Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Automated mechanistic interpretation research has attracted great interest due to its potential to scale explanations of neural network internals to large models. Existing automated circuit discovery work relies on activation patching or its approximations to identify subgraphs in models for specific tasks (circuits). They often suffer from slow runtime, approximation errors, and specific requirements of metrics, such as non-zero gradients. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T) to build interpretable circuits in large language models. CD-T can produce circuits of arbitrary level of abstraction, and is the first able to produce circuits as fine-grained as attention heads at specific sequence positions efficiently. CD-T consists of a set of mathematical equations to isolate contribution of model features. Through recursively computing contribution of all nodes in a computational graph of a model using CD-T followed by pruning, we are able to reduce circuit discovery runtime from hours to seconds compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On three standard circuit evaluation datasets (indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion), we demonstrate that CD-T outperforms ACDC and EAP by better recovering the manual circuits with an average of 97% ROC AUC under low runtimes. In addition, we provide evidence that faithfulness of CD-T circuits is not due to random chance by showing our circuits are 80% more faithful than random circuits of up to 60% of the original model size. Finally, we show CD-T circuits are able to perfectly replicate original models' behavior (faithfulness $ = 1$) using fewer nodes than the baselines for all tasks. Our results underscore the great promise of CD-T for efficient automated mechanistic interpretability, paving the way for new insights into the workings of large language models.</p>

<p>Abstract: The widespread applications of large language models (LLMs) have brought about concerns regarding their potential misuse. Although aligned with human preference data before release, LLMs remain vulnerable to various malicious attacks. In this paper, we adopt a red-teaming strategy to enhance LLM safety and introduce SeqAR, a simple yet effective framework to design jailbreak prompts automatically. The SeqAR framework generates and optimizes multiple jailbreak characters and then applies sequential jailbreak characters in a single query to bypass the guardrails of the target LLM. Different from previous work which relies on proprietary LLMs or seed jailbreak templates crafted by human expertise, SeqAR can generate and optimize the jailbreak prompt in a cold-start scenario using open-sourced LLMs without any seed jailbreak templates. Experimental results show that SeqAR achieves attack success rates of 88% and 60% in bypassing the safety alignment of GPT-3.5-1106 and GPT-4, respectively. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate the transferability of the generated templates across different LLMs and held-out malicious requests, while also exploring defense strategies against the jailbreak attack designed by SeqAR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingrun Xing, Boyan Gao, Zheng Zhang, David A. Clifton, Shitao Xiao, Li Du, Guoqi Li, Jiajun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have improved performance in various applications, but their inference processes demand significant energy and computational resources. In contrast, the human brain, with approximately 86 billion neurons, is much more energy-efficient than LLMs with similar parameters. Inspired by this, we redesign 7$\sim$70 billion parameter LLMs using bio-plausible spiking mechanisms, emulating the efficient behavior of the human brain. We propose the first spiking large language model, SpikeLLM. Coupled with the proposed model, two essential approaches are proposed to improve spike training efficiency: Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) neurons to compress spike length from $T$ to $\frac{T}{L} \log_2 L$ bits, and an Optimal Brain Spiking framework to divide outlier channels and allocate different $T$ for GIF neurons, which further compresses spike length to approximate $log_2T$ bits. The necessity of spike-driven LLM is proved by comparison with quantized LLMs with similar operations. In the OmniQuant pipeline, SpikeLLM reduces 11.01% WikiText2 perplexity and improves 2.55% accuracy of common scene reasoning on a LLAMA-7B W4A4 model. In the GPTQ pipeline, SpikeLLM achieves direct additive in linear layers, significantly exceeding PB-LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Liana Patel, Siddharth Jha, Melissa Pan, Harshit Gupta, Parth Asawa, Carlos Guestrin, Matei Zaharia</p>
<p>Abstract: The semantic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enable rich analytics and reasoning over vast knowledge corpora. Unfortunately, existing systems either empirically optimize expensive LLM-powered operations with no performance guarantees, or serve a limited set of row-wise LLM operations, providing limited robustness, expressiveness and usability. We introduce semantic operators, the first formalism for declarative and general-purpose AI-based transformations based on natural language specifications (e.g., filtering, sorting, joining or aggregating records using natural language criteria). Each operator opens a rich space for execution plans, similar to relational operators. Our model specifies the expected behavior of each operator with a high-quality gold algorithm, and we develop an optimization framework that reduces cost, while providing accuracy guarantees with respect to a gold algorithm. Using this approach, we propose several novel optimizations to accelerate semantic filtering, joining, group-by and top-k operations by up to $1,000\times$. We implement semantic operators in the LOTUS system and demonstrate LOTUS' effectiveness on real, bulk-semantic processing applications, including fact-checking, biomedical multi-label classification, search, and topic analysis. We show that the semantic operator model is expressive, capturing state-of-the-art AI pipelines in a few operator calls, and making it easy to express new pipelines that match or exceed quality of recent LLM-based analytic systems by up to $170\%$, while offering accuracy guarantees. Overall, LOTUS programs match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art AI pipelines for each task while running up to $3.6\times$ faster than the highest-quality baselines.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danfeng Guo, Demetri Terzopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years, and they have been extended to the medical domain. Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chi-Heng Lin, Shangqian Gao, James Seale Smith, Abhishek Patel, Shikhar Tuli, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Siyin Wang, Wenyi Yu, Yudong Yang, Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Jimin Zhuang, Xianzhao Chen, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Guangzhi Sun, Lu Lu, Chao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) \etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Li, Nanxi Li, Yuanjie Chen, Jianbin Zhu, Qinlu Guo, Cewu Lu, Yong-Lu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive capability. However, recently many deficiencies of MLLMs have been found compared to human intelligence, $\textit{e.g.}$, hallucination. To drive the MLLMs study, the community dedicated efforts to building larger benchmarks with complex tasks. In this paper, we propose benchmarking an essential but usually overlooked intelligence: $\textbf{association}$, a human's basic capability to link observation and prior practice memory. To comprehensively investigate MLLM's performance on the association, we formulate the association task and devise a standard benchmark based on adjective and verb semantic concepts. Instead of costly data annotation and curation, we propose a convenient $\textbf{annotation-free}$ construction method transforming the general dataset for our association tasks. Simultaneously, we devise a rigorous data refinement process to eliminate confusion in the raw dataset. Building on this database, we establish three levels of association tasks: single-step, synchronous, and asynchronous associations. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the MLLMs' zero-shot association capabilities, addressing multiple dimensions, including three distinct memory strategies, both open-source and closed-source MLLMs, cutting-edge Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, and the involvement of human experts. Our systematic investigation shows that current open-source MLLMs consistently exhibit poor capability in our association tasks, even the currently state-of-the-art GPT-4V(vision) also has a significant gap compared to humans. We believe our benchmark would pave the way for future MLLM studies. $\textit{Our data and code are available at:}$ https://mvig-rhos.com/llm_inception.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianchi Xie, Jiangning Zhu, Guozu Ma, Minzhi Lin, Wei Chen, Weikai Yang, Shixia Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Sample selection improves the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models by providing informative and representative samples. Typically, samples can be modeled as a sample graph, where nodes are samples and edges represent their similarities. Most existing methods are based on local information, such as the training difficulty of samples, thereby overlooking global information, such as connectivity patterns. This oversight can result in suboptimal selection because global information is crucial for ensuring that the selected samples well represent the structural properties of the graph. To address this issue, we employ structural entropy to quantify global information and losslessly decompose it from the whole graph to individual nodes using the Shapley value. Based on the decomposition, we present $\textbf{S}$tructural-$\textbf{E}$ntropy-based sample $\textbf{S}$election ($\textbf{SES}$), a method that integrates both global and local information to select informative and representative samples. SES begins by constructing a $k$NN-graph among samples based on their similarities. It then measures sample importance by combining structural entropy (global metric) with training difficulty (local metric). Finally, SES applies importance-biased blue noise sampling to select a set of diverse and representative samples. Comprehensive experiments on three learning scenarios -- supervised learning, active learning, and continual learning -- clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyu Gou, Ruohan Wang, Boyuan Zheng, Yanan Xie, Cheng Chang, Yiheng Shu, Huan Sun, Yu Su</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms. However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tong Wu, Shujian Zhang, Kaiqiang Song, Silei Xu, Sanqiang Zhao, Ravi Agrawal, Sathish Reddy Indurthi, Chong Xiang, Prateek Mittal, Wenxuan Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to security and safety threats, such as prompt injection, prompt extraction, and harmful requests. One major cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of an instruction hierarchy. Modern LLM architectures treat all inputs equally, failing to distinguish between and prioritize various types of instructions, such as system messages, user prompts, and data. As a result, lower-priority user prompts may override more critical system instructions, including safety protocols. Existing approaches to achieving instruction hierarchy, such as delimiters and instruction-based training, do not address this issue at the architectural level. We introduce the Instructional Segment Embedding (ISE) technique, inspired by BERT, to modern large language models, which embeds instruction priority information directly into the model. This approach enables models to explicitly differentiate and prioritize various instruction types, significantly improving safety against malicious prompts that attempt to override priority rules. Our experiments on the Structured Query and Instruction Hierarchy benchmarks demonstrate an average robust accuracy increase of up to 15.75% and 18.68%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe an improvement in instruction-following capability of up to 4.1% evaluated on AlpacaEval. Overall, our approach offers a promising direction for enhancing the safety and effectiveness of LLM architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Yu, Chaoyue Tang, Bokai Xu, Junbo Cui, Junhao Ran, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an effective technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources for generation. However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it impossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play crucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents. In this paper, we introduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language model (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the document to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an image and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to traditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of the data information in the original documents, eliminating the information loss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and synthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of generation methods. Experiments demonstrate that VisRAG outperforms traditional RAG in both the retrieval and generation stages, achieving a 20--40% end-to-end performance gain over traditional text-based RAG pipeline. Further analysis reveals that VisRAG is efficient in utilizing training data and demonstrates strong generalization capability, positioning it as a promising solution for RAG on multi-modality documents.

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12735">CREAM: Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Wang, Weilei He, Zhiyuan Liang, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Ying Wei, Weitong Zhang, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the consistency of rewards across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Xia, Kangyu Zhu, Haoran Li, Tianze Wang, Weijia Shi, Sheng Wang, Linjun Zhang, James Zou, Huaxiu Yao</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based agents face significant challenges in handling complex GUI (Graphical User Interface) interactions on devices. These challenges arise from the dynamic and structured nature of GUI environments, which integrate text, images, and spatial relationships, as well as the variability in action spaces across different pages and tasks. To address these limitations, we propose MobA, a novel MLLM-based mobile assistant system. MobA introduces an adaptive planning module that incorporates a reflection mechanism for error recovery and dynamically adjusts plans to align with the real environment contexts and action module's execution capacity. Additionally, a multifaceted memory module provides comprehensive memory support to enhance adaptability and efficiency. We also present MobBench, a dataset designed for complex mobile interactions. Experimental results on MobBench and AndroidArena demonstrate MobA's ability to handle dynamic GUI environments and perform complex mobile task.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating chatbot fairness is crucial given their rapid proliferation, yet typical chatbot tasks (e.g., resume writing, entertainment) diverge from the institutional decision-making tasks (e.g., resume screening) which have traditionally been central to discussion of algorithmic fairness. The open-ended nature and diverse use-cases of chatbots necessitate novel methods for bias assessment. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a scalable counterfactual approach to evaluate "first-person fairness," meaning fairness toward chatbot users based on demographic characteristics. Our method employs a Language Model as a Research Assistant (LMRA) to yield quantitative measures of harmful stereotypes and qualitative analyses of demographic differences in chatbot responses. We apply this approach to assess biases in six of our language models across millions of interactions, covering sixty-six tasks in nine domains and spanning two genders and four races. Independent human annotations corroborate the LMRA-generated bias evaluations. This study represents the first large-scale fairness evaluation based on real-world chat data. We highlight that post-training reinforcement learning techniques significantly mitigate these biases. This evaluation provides a practical methodology for ongoing bias monitoring and mitigation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment of large language models (LLMs) are key steps in providing a good user experience. However, the concept of an appropriate alignment is inherently application-dependent, and current methods often rely on heuristic choices to drive optimization. In this work, we formulate SFT and alignment as a constrained optimization problem: the LLM is fine-tuned on a task while being required to meet application-specific requirements, without resorting to heuristics. To solve this, we propose Lagrange Large Language Models (L3Ms), which employ logarithmic barriers to enforce the constraints. This approach allows for the customization of L3Ms across diverse applications while avoiding heuristic-driven processes. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of L3Ms in achieving tailored alignments for various applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yule Liu, Zhiyuan Zhong, Yifan Liao, Zhen Sun, Jingyi Zheng, Jiaheng Wei, Qingyuan Gong, Fenghua Tong, Yang Chen, Yang Zhang, Xinlei He</p>
<p>Abstract: The rising popularity of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about machine-generated text (MGT), particularly in academic settings, where issues like plagiarism and misinformation are prevalent. As a result, developing a highly generalizable and adaptable MGT detection system has become an urgent priority. Given that LLMs are most commonly misused in academic writing, this work investigates the generalization and adaptation capabilities of MGT detectors in three key aspects specific to academic writing: First, we construct MGT-Acedemic, a large-scale dataset comprising over 336M tokens and 749K samples. MGT-Acedemic focuses on academic writing, featuring human-written texts (HWTs) and MGTs across STEM, Humanities, and Social Sciences, paired with an extensible code framework for efficient benchmarking. Second, we benchmark the performance of various detectors for binary classification and attribution tasks in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. This benchmark reveals the often-overlooked challenges of attribution tasks. Third, we introduce a novel attribution task where models have to adapt to new classes over time without (or with very limited) access to prior training data in both few-shot and many-shot scenarios. We implement eight different adapting techniques to improve the performance and highlight the inherent complexity of the task. Our findings provide insights into the generalization and adaptation ability of MGT detectors across diverse scenarios and lay the foundation for building robust, adaptive detection systems.

<p>Abstract: The remarkable performance of the o1 model in complex reasoning demonstrates that test-time compute scaling can further unlock the model's potential, enabling powerful System-2 thinking. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive surveys for test-time compute scaling. We trace the concept of test-time compute back to System-1 models. In System-1 models, test-time compute addresses distribution shifts and improves robustness and generalization through parameter updating, input modification, representation editing, and output calibration. In System-2 models, it enhances the model's reasoning ability to solve complex problems through repeated sampling, self-correction, and tree search. We organize this survey according to the trend of System-1 to System-2 thinking, highlighting the key role of test-time compute in the transition from System-1 models to weak System-2 models, and then to strong System-2 models. We also point out a few possible future directions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaolei Zhang, Qingkai Fang, Zhe Yang, Yang Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zheqi Lv, Keming Ye, Zishu Wei, Qi Tian, Shengyu Zhang, Wenqiao Zhang, Wenjie Wang, Kun Kuang, Tat-Seng Chua, Fei Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks have become foundational to advancements in multiple domains, including recommendation systems, natural language processing, and so on. Despite their successes, these models often contain incompatible parameters that can be underutilized or detrimental to model performance, particularly when faced with specific, varying data distributions. Existing research excels in removing such parameters or merging the outputs of multiple different pretrained models. However, the former focuses on efficiency rather than performance, while the latter requires several times more computing and storage resources to support inference. In this paper, we set the goal to explicitly improve these incompatible parameters by leveraging the complementary strengths of different models, thereby directly enhancing the models without any additional parameters. Specifically, we propose Compatibility-aware Knowledge Integration (CKI), which consists of Parameter Compatibility Assessment and Parameter Splicing, which are used to evaluate the knowledge content of multiple models and integrate the knowledge into one model, respectively. The integrated model can be used directly for inference or for further fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets for recommendation and language tasks, and the results show that Compatibility-aware Knowledge Integration can effectively optimize incompatible parameters under multiple tasks and settings to break through the training limit of the original model without increasing the inference cost.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an essential skill for embodied agents, allowing them to navigate in 3D environments following natural language instructions. High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM. We annotate over 2 million navigation instructions across 861 scenes and evaluate the data quality and navigation performance of trained models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bohan Lyu, Siqiao Huang, Zichen Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural surrogate models have emerged as powerful and efficient tools in data mining. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks. We investigate a novel application: using LLMs as surrogate models for code execution prediction. Given LLMs' unique ability to understand and process diverse programs, they present a promising direction for building general-purpose surrogate models. To systematically investigate this capability, we introduce SURGE, a comprehensive benchmark with $1160$ problems covering $8$ key aspects: multi-language programming tasks, competition-level programming problems, repository-level code analysis, high-cost scientific computing, time-complexity-intensive algorithms, buggy code analysis, programs dependent on specific compilers or execution environments, and formal mathematical proof verification. Through extensive empirical analysis of $21$ open-source and proprietary LLMs, we examine scaling laws, data efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Our findings reveal important insights about the feasibility of LLMs as efficient surrogates for computational processes, with implications for automated software testing, program analysis, and computational resource optimization in data mining applications.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shao Zhang, Xihuai Wang, Wenhao Zhang, Chaoran Li, Junru Song, Tingyu Li, Lin Qiu, Xuezhi Cao, Xunliang Cai, Wen Yao, Weinan Zhang, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12215">Revisiting the Test-Time Scaling of o1-like Models: Do they Truly Possess Test-Time Scaling Capabilities?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Zeng, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhangyue Yin, Yunhua Zhou, Xipeng Qiu</p>
<p>Abstract: The advent of test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's o1 series, has advanced reasoning capabilities by scaling computational resource allocation during inference. While successors like QwQ, Deepseek-R1 (R1) and LIMO replicate these advancements, whether these models truly possess test-time scaling capabilities remains underexplored. This study found that longer CoTs of these o1-like models do not consistently enhance accuracy; in fact, correct solutions are often shorter than incorrect ones for the same questions. Further investigation shows this phenomenon is closely related to models' self-revision capabilities - longer CoTs contain more self-revisions, which often lead to performance degradation. We then compare sequential and parallel scaling strategies on QwQ, R1 and LIMO, finding that parallel scaling achieves better coverage and scalability. Based on these insights, we propose Shortest Majority Vote, a method that combines parallel scaling strategies with CoT length characteristics, significantly improving models' test-time scalability compared to conventional majority voting approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hamid Moradi-Kamali, Mohammad-Hossein Rajabi-Ghozlou, Mahdi Ghazavi, Ali Soltani, Amirreza Sattarzadeh, Reza Entezari-Maleki</p>
<p>Abstract: Financial Sentiment Analysis (FSA) traditionally relies on human-annotated sentiment labels to infer investor sentiment and forecast market movements. However, inferring the potential market impact of words based on their human-perceived intentions is inherently challenging. We hypothesize that the historical market reactions to words, offer a more reliable indicator of their potential impact on markets than subjective sentiment interpretations by human annotators. To test this hypothesis, a market-derived labeling approach is proposed to assign tweet labels based on ensuing short-term price trends, enabling the language model to capture the relationship between textual signals and market dynamics directly. A domain-specific language model was fine-tuned on these labels, achieving up to an 11% improvement in short-term trend prediction accuracy over traditional sentiment-based benchmarks. Moreover, by incorporating market and temporal context through prompt-tuning, the proposed context-aware language model demonstrated an accuracy of 89.6% on a curated dataset of 227 impactful Bitcoin-related news events with significant market impacts. Aggregating daily tweet predictions into trading signals, our method outperformed traditional fusion models (which combine sentiment-based and price-based predictions). It challenged the assumption that sentiment-based signals are inferior to price-based predictions in forecasting market movements. Backtesting these signals across three distinct market regimes yielded robust Sharpe ratios of up to 5.07 in trending markets and 3.73 in neutral markets. Our findings demonstrate that language models can serve as effective short-term market predictors. This paradigm shift underscores the untapped capabilities of language models in financial decision-making and opens new avenues for market prediction applications.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15823">InductionBench: LLMs Fail in the Simplest Complexity Class</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyue Hua, Tyler Wong, Sun Fei, Liangming Pan, Adam Jardine, William Yang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities. Coda and data are available https://github.com/Wenyueh/inductive_reasoning_benchmark.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18858">Evaluating Intelligence via Trial and Error</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingtao Zhan, Jiahao Zhao, Jiayu Li, Yiqun Liu, Bo Zhang, Qingyao Ai, Jiaxin Mao, Hongning Wang, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligence is a crucial trait for species to find solutions within a limited number of trial-and-error attempts. Building on this idea, we introduce Survival Game as a framework to evaluate intelligence based on the number of failed attempts in a trial-and-error process. Fewer failures indicate higher intelligence. When the expectation and variance of failure counts are both finite, it signals the ability to consistently find solutions to new challenges, which we define as the Autonomous Level of intelligence. Using Survival Game, we comprehensively evaluate existing AI systems. Our results show that while AI systems achieve the Autonomous Level in simple tasks, they are still far from it in more complex tasks, such as vision, search, recommendation, and language. While scaling current AI technologies might help, this would come at an astronomical cost. Projections suggest that achieving the Autonomous Level for general tasks would require $10^{26}$ parameters. To put this into perspective, loading such a massive model requires so many H100 GPUs that their total value is $10^{7}$ times that of Apple Inc.'s market value. Even with Moore's Law, supporting such a parameter scale would take $70$ years. This staggering cost highlights the complexity of human tasks and the inadequacies of current AI technologies. To further investigate this phenomenon, we conduct a theoretical analysis of Survival Game and its experimental results. Our findings suggest that human tasks possess a criticality property. As a result, Autonomous Level requires a deep understanding of the task's underlying mechanisms. Current AI systems, however, do not fully grasp these mechanisms and instead rely on superficial mimicry, making it difficult for them to reach an autonomous level. We believe Survival Game can not only guide the future development of AI but also offer profound insights into human intelligence.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19649">Taxonomy, Opportunities, and Challenges of Representation Engineering for Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jan Wehner, Sahar Abdelnabi, Daniel Tan, David Krueger, Mario Fritz</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling the behavior of LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that modify inputs or fine-tune the model, RepE directly manipulates the model's internal representations. As a result, it may offer more effective, interpretable, data-efficient, and flexible control over models' behavior. We present the first comprehensive survey of RepE for LLMs, reviewing the rapidly growing literature to address key questions: What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? For what concepts and problems has RepE been applied? What are the strengths and weaknesses of RepE compared to other methods? To answer these, we propose a unified framework describing RepE as a pipeline comprising representation identification, operationalization, and control. We posit that while RepE methods offer significant potential, challenges remain, including managing multiple concepts, ensuring reliability, and preserving models' performance. Towards improving RepE, we identify opportunities for experimental and methodological improvements and construct a guide for best practices.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xujie Yuan, Yongxu Liu, Shimin Di, Shiwen Wu, Libin Zheng, Rui Meng, Lei Chen, Xiaofang Zhou, Jian Yin</p>
<p>Abstract: The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework has attracted significant interest, with early studies showing promise in mitigating hallucinations and improving model accuracy. However, a systematic understanding and comparative analysis of the rapidly emerging KG-RAG methods are still lacking. This paper seeks to lay the foundation for systematically answering the question of when and how to use KG-RAG by analyzing their performance in various application scenarios associated with different technical configurations. After outlining the mind map using KG-RAG framework and summarizing its popular pipeline, we conduct a pilot empirical study of KG-RAG works to reimplement and evaluate 6 KG-RAG methods across 7 datasets in diverse scenarios, analyzing the impact of 9 KG-RAG configurations in combination with 17 LLMs. Our results underscore the critical role of appropriate application conditions and optimal configurations of KG-RAG components.</p>
