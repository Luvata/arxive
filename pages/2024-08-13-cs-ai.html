<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoshua Bengio, Michael K. Cohen, Nikolay Malkin, Matt MacDermott, Damiano Fornasiere, Pietro Greiner, Younesse Kaddar</p>
<p>Abstract: Is there a way to design powerful AI systems based on machine learning methods that would satisfy probabilistic safety guarantees? With the long-term goal of obtaining a probabilistic guarantee that would apply in every context, we consider estimating a context-dependent bound on the probability of violating a given safety specification. Such a risk evaluation would need to be performed at run-time to provide a guardrail against dangerous actions of an AI. Noting that different plausible hypotheses about the world could produce very different outcomes, and because we do not know which one is right, we derive bounds on the safety violation probability predicted under the true but unknown hypothesis. Such bounds could be used to reject potentially dangerous actions. Our main results involve searching for cautious but plausible hypotheses, obtained by a maximization that involves Bayesian posteriors over hypotheses. We consider two forms of this result, in the iid case and in the non-iid case, and conclude with open problems towards turning such theoretical results into practical AI guardrails.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05334">Revisiting Multi-Modal LLM Evaluation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Lu, Shikhar Srivastava, Junyu Chen, Robik Shrestha, Manoj Acharya, Kushal Kafle, Christopher Kanan</p>
<p>Abstract: With the advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), datasets used for visual question answering (VQA) and referring expression comprehension have seen a resurgence. However, the most popular datasets used to evaluate MLLMs are some of the earliest ones created, and they have many known problems, including extreme bias, spurious correlations, and an inability to permit fine-grained analysis. In this paper, we pioneer evaluating recent MLLMs (LLaVA 1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, GPT-4V, and GPT-4o) on datasets designed to address weaknesses in earlier ones. We assess three VQA datasets: 1) TDIUC, which permits fine-grained analysis on 12 question types; 2) TallyQA, which has simple and complex counting questions; and 3) DVQA, which requires optical character recognition for chart understanding. We also study VQDv1, a dataset that requires identifying all image regions that satisfy a given query. Our experiments reveal the weaknesses of many MLLMs that have not previously been reported. Our code is integrated into the widely used LAVIS framework for MLLM evaluation, enabling the rapid assessment of future MLLMs. Project webpage: https://kevinlujian.github.io/MLLM_Evaluations/</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi-Qi Cheng, Yifei Dong, Aike Shi, Wei Liu, Yuzhi Hu, Jason O'Connor, Alexander Hauptmann, Kate Whitefoot</p>
<p>Abstract: The electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain's vulnerability to disruptions necessitates advanced predictive analytics. We present SHIELD (Schema-based Hierarchical Induction for EV supply chain Disruption), a system integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with domain expertise for EV battery supply chain risk assessment. SHIELD combines: (1) LLM-driven schema learning to construct a comprehensive knowledge library, (2) a disruption analysis system utilizing fine-tuned language models for event extraction, multi-dimensional similarity matching for schema matching, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with logical constraints for prediction, and (3) an interactive interface for visualizing results and incorporating expert feedback to enhance decision-making. Evaluated on 12,070 paragraphs from 365 sources (2022-2023), SHIELD outperforms baseline GCNs and LLM+prompt methods (e.g., GPT-4o) in disruption prediction. These results demonstrate SHIELD's effectiveness in combining LLM capabilities with domain expertise for enhanced supply chain risk assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Brienza, Francesco Argenziano, Vincenzo Suriani, Domenico D. Bloisi, Daniele Nardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) are attracting increasing interest due to their improving performance and applications across various domains and tasks. However, LLMs and VLMs can produce erroneous results, especially when a deep understanding of the problem domain is required. For instance, when planning and perception are needed simultaneously, these models often struggle because of difficulties in merging multi-modal information. To address this issue, fine-tuned models are typically employed and trained on specialized data structures representing the environment. This approach has limited effectiveness, as it can overly complicate the context for processing. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent architecture for embodied task planning that operates without the need for specific data structures as input. Instead, it uses a single image of the environment, handling free-form domains by leveraging commonsense knowledge. We also introduce a novel, fully automatic evaluation procedure, PG2S, designed to better assess the quality of a plan. We validated our approach using the widely recognized ALFRED dataset, comparing PG2S to the existing KAS metric to further evaluate the quality of the generated plans.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ronit Bustin, Claudia V. Goldman</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex sequential decision-making planning problems, covering infinite states' space have been shown to be solvable by AlphaZero type of algorithms. Such an approach that trains a neural model while simulating projection of futures with a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm were shown to be applicable to real life planning problems. As such, engineers and users interacting with the resulting policy of behavior might benefit from obtaining automated explanations about these planners' decisions offline or online. This paper focuses on the information within the Monte Carlo Tree Search data structure. Given its construction, this information contains much of the reasoning of the sequential decision-making algorithm and is essential for its explainability. We show novel methods using information theoretic tools for the simplification and reduction of the Monte Carlo Tree Search and the extraction of information. Such information can be directly used for the construction of human understandable explanations. We show that basic explainability quantities can be calculated with limited additional computational cost, as an integrated part of the Monte Carlo Tree Search construction process. We focus on the theoretical and algorithmic aspects and provide examples of how the methods presented here can be used in the construction of human understandable explanations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05568">Metacognitive Myopia in Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Florian Scholten, Tobias R. Rebholz, Mandy H\"utter</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potentially harmful biases that reinforce culturally inherent stereotypes, cloud moral judgments, or amplify positive evaluations of majority groups. Previous explanations mainly attributed bias in LLMs to human annotators and the selection of training data. Consequently, they have typically been addressed with bottom-up approaches such as reinforcement learning or debiasing corpora. However, these methods only treat the effects of LLM biases by indirectly influencing the model architecture, but do not address the underlying causes in the computational process. Here, we propose metacognitive myopia as a cognitive-ecological framework that can account for a conglomerate of established and emerging LLM biases and provide a lever to address problems in powerful but vulnerable tools. Our theoretical framework posits that a lack of the two components of metacognition, monitoring and control, causes five symptoms of metacognitive myopia in LLMs: integration of invalid tokens and embeddings, susceptibility to redundant information, neglect of base rates in conditional computation, decision rules based on frequency, and inappropriate higher-order statistical inference for nested data structures. As a result, LLMs produce erroneous output that reaches into the daily high-stakes decisions of humans. By introducing metacognitive regulatory processes into LLMs, engineers and scientists can develop precise remedies for the underlying causes of these biases. Our theory sheds new light on flawed human-machine interactions and raises ethical concerns regarding the increasing, imprudent implementation of LLMs in organizational structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuxin Li, Chang Yang, Youzhi Zhang, Pengdeng Li, Xinrun Wang, Xiao Huang, Hau Chan, Bo An</p>
<p>Abstract: Nash equilibrium (NE) is a widely adopted solution concept in game theory due to its stability property. However, we observe that the NE strategy might not always yield the best results, especially against opponents who do not adhere to NE strategies. Based on this observation, we pose a new game-solving question: Can we learn a model that can exploit any, even NE, opponent to maximize their own utility? In this work, we make the first attempt to investigate this problem through in-context learning. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, In-Context Exploiter (ICE), to train a single model that can act as any player in the game and adaptively exploit opponents entirely by in-context learning. Our ICE algorithm involves generating diverse opponent strategies, collecting interactive history training data by a reinforcement learning algorithm, and training a transformer-based agent within a well-designed curriculum learning framework. Finally, comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our ICE algorithm, showcasing its in-context learning ability to exploit any unknown opponent, thereby positively answering our initial game-solving question.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05682">Separate Generation and Evaluation for Parallel Greedy Best-First Search</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Takumi Shimoda, Alex Fukunaga</p>
<p>Abstract: Parallelization of Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) has been difficult because straightforward parallelization can result in search behavior which differs significantly from sequential GBFS, exploring states which would not be explored by sequential GBFS with any tie-breaking strategy. Recent work has proposed a class of parallel GBFS algorithms which constrains search to exploration of the Bench Transition System (BTS), which is the set of states that can be expanded by GBFS under some tie-breaking policy. However, enforcing this constraint is costly, as such BTS-constrained algorithms are forced to spend much of the time waiting so that only states which are guaranteed to be in the BTS are expanded. We propose an improvement to parallel search which decouples state generation and state evaluation and significantly improves state evaluation rate, resulting in better search performance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05715">Top Pass: Improve Code Generation by Pass@k-Maximized Code Ranking</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhi-Cun Lyu, Xin-Ye Li, Zheng Xie, Ming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Code generation has been greatly enhanced by the profound advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) recently. Nevertheless, such LLM-based code generation approaches still struggle to generate error-free code in a few tries when faced with complex problems. To address this, the prevailing strategy is to sample a huge number of candidate programs, with the hope of any one in them could work. However, users of code generation systems usually expect to find a correct program by reviewing or testing only a small number of code candidates. Otherwise, the system would be unhelpful. In this paper, we propose Top Pass, a code ranking approach that identifies potential correct solutions from a large number of candidates. Top Pass directly optimizes the pass@k loss function, enhancing the quality at the top of the candidate list. This enables the user to find the correct solution within as few tries as possible. Experimental results on four benchmarks indicate that our Top Pass method enhances the usability of code generation models by producing better ranking results, particularly achieving a 32.9\% relative improvement in pass@1 on CodeContests when compared to the state-of-the-art ranking method.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05748">Low-Dimensional Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding via Knowledge Distillation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoxiong Zhang, Zhiwei Zeng, Xin Zhou, Zhiqi Shen</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE) aims to facilitate collaborative learning of entity and relation embeddings from distributed Knowledge Graphs (KGs) across multiple clients, while preserving data privacy. Training FKGE models with higher dimensions is typically favored due to their potential for achieving superior performance. However, high-dimensional embeddings present significant challenges in terms of storage resource and inference speed. Unlike traditional KG embedding methods, FKGE involves multiple client-server communication rounds, where communication efficiency is critical. Existing embedding compression methods for traditional KGs may not be directly applicable to FKGE as they often require multiple model trainings which potentially incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose a light-weight component based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) which is titled FedKD and tailored specifically for FKGE methods. During client-side local training, FedKD facilitates the low-dimensional student model to mimic the score distribution of triples from the high-dimensional teacher model using KL divergence loss. Unlike traditional KD way, FedKD adaptively learns a temperature to scale the score of positive triples and separately adjusts the scores of corresponding negative triples using a predefined temperature, thereby mitigating teacher over-confidence issue. Furthermore, we dynamically adjust the weight of KD loss to optimize the training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets support the effectiveness of FedKD.</p>

<p>Abstract: Amidst the rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and their widespread application in generating and interpreting complex content, the risk of propagating biased and harmful memes remains significant. Current safety measures often fail to detect subtly integrated hateful content within ``Confounder Memes''. To address this, we introduce \textsc{HateSieve}, a new framework designed to enhance the detection and segmentation of hateful elements in memes. \textsc{HateSieve} features a novel Contrastive Meme Generator that creates semantically paired memes, a customized triplet dataset for contrastive learning, and an Image-Text Alignment module that produces context-aware embeddings for accurate meme segmentation. Empirical experiments on the Hateful Meme Dataset show that \textsc{HateSieve} not only surpasses existing LMMs in performance with fewer trainable parameters but also offers a robust mechanism for precisely identifying and isolating hateful content. \textcolor{red}{Caution: Contains academic discussions of hate speech; viewer discretion advised.}</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongqiu Wu, Zekai Xu, Tianyang Xu, Jiale Hong, Weiqi Wu, Hai Zhao, Min Zhang, Zhezhi He</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on \emph{virtual world}, a cyberspace where people can live in. An ideal virtual world shares great similarity with our real world. One of the crucial aspects is its evolving nature, reflected by the individuals' capacity to grow and thereby influence the objective world. Such dynamics is unpredictable and beyond the reach of existing systems. For this, we propose a special engine called \emph{Delta-Engine} to drive this virtual world. $\Delta$ associates the world's evolution to the engine's expansion. A delta-engine consists of a base engine and a neural proxy. Given an observation, the proxy generates new code based on the base engine through the process of \emph{incremental prediction}.
  This paper presents a full-stack introduction to the delta-engine. The key feature of the delta-engine is its scalability to unknown elements within the world, Technically, it derives from the prefect co-work of the neural proxy and the base engine, and the alignment with high-quality data. We an engine-oriented fine-tuning method that embeds the base engine into the proxy. We then discuss a human-AI collaborative design process to produce novel and interesting data efficiently. Eventually, we propose three evaluation principles to comprehensively assess the performance of a delta engine: naive evaluation, incremental evaluation, and adversarial evaluation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adam Davies, Ashkan Khakzar</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial neural networks have long been understood as "black boxes": though we know their computation graphs and learned parameters, the knowledge encoded by these weights and functions they perform are not inherently interpretable. As such, from the early days of deep learning, there have been efforts to explain these models' behavior and understand them internally; and recently, mechanistic interpretability (MI) has emerged as a distinct research area studying the features and implicit algorithms learned by foundation models such as large language models. In this work, we aim to ground MI in the context of cognitive science, which has long struggled with analogous questions in studying and explaining the behavior of "black box" intelligent systems like the human brain. We leverage several important ideas and developments in the history of cognitive science to disentangle divergent objectives in MI and indicate a clear path forward. First, we argue that current methods are ripe to facilitate a transition in deep learning interpretation echoing the "cognitive revolution" in 20th-century psychology that shifted the study of human psychology from pure behaviorism toward mental representations and processing. Second, we propose a taxonomy mirroring key parallels in computational neuroscience to describe two broad categories of MI research, semantic interpretation (what latent representations are learned and used) and algorithmic interpretation (what operations are performed over representations) to elucidate their divergent goals and objects of study. Finally, we elaborate the parallels and distinctions between various approaches in both categories, analyze the respective strengths and weaknesses of representative works, clarify underlying assumptions, outline key challenges, and discuss the possibility of unifying these modes of interpretation under a common framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shi Bo, Minheng Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to root cause attribution of delivery risks within supply chains by integrating causal discovery with reinforcement learning. As supply chains become increasingly complex, traditional methods of root cause analysis struggle to capture the intricate interrelationships between various factors, often leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal decision-making. Our approach addresses these challenges by leveraging causal discovery to identify the true causal relationships between operational variables, and reinforcement learning to iteratively refine the causal graph. This method enables the accurate identification of key drivers of late deliveries, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides actionable insights for optimizing supply chain performance. We apply our approach to a real-world supply chain dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying causes of delivery delays and offering strategies for mitigating these risks. The findings have significant implications for improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability within supply chains.</p>

<p>Abstract: Humans observe only part of their environment at any moment but can still make complex, long-term decisions thanks to our long-term memory system. To test how an AI can learn and utilize its long-term memory system, we have developed a partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) environment, where the agent has to answer questions while navigating a maze. The environment is completely knowledge graph (KG) based, where the hidden states are dynamic KGs. A KG is both human- and machine-readable, making it easy to see what the agents remember and forget. We train and compare agents with different memory systems, to shed light on how human brains work when it comes to managing its own memory systems. By repurposing the given learning objective as learning a memory management policy, we were able to capture the most likely belief state, which is not only interpretable but also reusable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahui Jin, Yifan Song, Dong Kan, Haojia Zhu, Xiangguo Sun, Zhicheng Li, Xigang Sun, Jinghui Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Urban region representation is crucial for various urban downstream tasks. However, despite the proliferation of methods and their success, acquiring general urban region knowledge and adapting to different tasks remains challenging. Previous work often neglects the spatial structures and functional layouts between entities, limiting their ability to capture transferable knowledge across regions. Further, these methods struggle to adapt effectively to specific downstream tasks, as they do not adequately address the unique features and relationships required for different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a $\textbf{G}$raph-based $\textbf{U}$rban $\textbf{R}$egion $\textbf{P}$re-training and $\textbf{P}$rompting framework ($\textbf{GURPP}$) for region representation learning. Specifically, we first construct an urban region graph that integrates detailed spatial entity data for more effective urban region representation. Then, we develop a subgraph-centric urban region pre-training model to capture the heterogeneous and transferable patterns of interactions among entities. To further enhance the adaptability of these embeddings to different tasks, we design two graph-based prompting methods to incorporate explicit/hidden task knowledge. Extensive experiments on various urban region prediction tasks and different cities demonstrate the superior performance of our GURPP framework. The implementation is available at this repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GURPP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hee Suk Yoon, Eunseop Yoon, Joshua Tian Jin Tee, Kang Zhang, Yu-Jung Heo, Du-Seong Chang, Chang D. Yoo</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Response Generation (MDRG) is a recently proposed task where the model needs to generate responses in texts, images, or a blend of both based on the dialogue context. Due to the lack of a large-scale dataset specifically for this task and the benefits of leveraging powerful pre-trained models, previous work relies on the text modality as an intermediary step for both the image input and output of the model rather than adopting an end-to-end approach. However, this approach can overlook crucial information about the image, hindering 1) image-grounded text response and 2) consistency of objects in the image response. In this paper, we propose BI-MDRG that bridges the response generation path such that the image history information is utilized for enhanced relevance of text responses to the image content and the consistency of objects in sequential image responses. Through extensive experiments on the multimodal dialogue benchmark dataset, we show that BI-MDRG can effectively increase the quality of multimodal dialogue. Additionally, recognizing the gap in benchmark datasets for evaluating the image consistency in multimodal dialogue, we have created a curated set of 300 dialogues annotated to track object consistency across conversations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehmet Kayra O\u{g}uz, Alexander Dockhorn</p>
<p>Abstract: Markov Junior is a probabilistic programming language used for procedural content generation across various domains. However, its reliance on manually crafted and tuned probabilistic rule sets, also called grammars, presents a significant bottleneck, diverging from approaches that allow rule learning from examples. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to this challenge by introducing a genetic programming-based optimization framework for learning hierarchical rule sets automatically. Our proposed method ``Markov Senior'' focuses on extracting positional and distance relations from single input samples to construct probabilistic rules to be used by Markov Junior. Using a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based fitness measure, we search for grammars to generate content that is coherent with the given sample. To enhance scalability, we introduce a divide-and-conquer strategy that enables the efficient generation of large-scale content. We validate our approach through experiments in generating image-based content and Super Mario levels, demonstrating its flexibility and effectiveness. In this way, ``Markov Senior'' allows for the wider application of Markov Junior for tasks in which an example may be available, but the design of a generative rule set is infeasible.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many works in the domain of artificial intelligence in games focus on board or video games due to the ease of reimplementing their mechanics. Decision-making problems in real-world sports share many similarities to such domains. Nevertheless, not many frameworks on sports games exist. In this paper, we present the tennis match simulation environment \textit{Match Point AI}, in which different agents can compete against real-world data-driven bot strategies. Next to presenting the framework, we highlight its capabilities by illustrating, how MCTS can be used in Match Point AI to optimize the shot direction selection problem in tennis. While the framework will be extended in the future, first experiments already reveal that generated shot-by-shot data of simulated tennis matches show realistic characteristics when compared to real-world data. At the same time, reasonable shot placement strategies emerge, which share similarities to the ones found in real-world tennis matches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daria de Tinguy, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt</p>
<p>Abstract: Drawing inspiration from animal navigation strategies, we introduce a novel computational model for navigation and mapping, rooted in biologically inspired principles. Animals exhibit remarkable navigation abilities by efficiently using memory, imagination, and strategic decision-making to navigate complex and aliased environments. Building on these insights, we integrate traditional cognitive mapping approaches with an Active Inference Framework (AIF) to learn an environment structure in a few steps. Through the incorporation of topological mapping for long-term memory and AIF for navigation planning and structure learning, our model can dynamically apprehend environmental structures and expand its internal map with predicted beliefs during exploration. Comparative experiments with the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG) model highlight our model's ability to rapidly learn environmental structures in a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap. this is achieved without prior knowledge of the dimensions of the environment or the type of observations, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in navigating ambiguous environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiu-Chou Lin, Wei-Chen Chiu, I-Chen Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Defining and measuring decision-making styles, also known as playstyles, is crucial in gaming, where these styles reflect a broad spectrum of individuality and diversity. However, finding a universally applicable measure for these styles poses a challenge. Building on Playstyle Distance, the first unsupervised metric to measure playstyle similarity based on game screens and raw actions, we introduce three enhancements to increase accuracy: multiscale analysis with varied state granularity, a perceptual kernel rooted in psychology, and the utilization of the intersection-over-union method for efficient evaluation. These innovations not only advance measurement precision but also offer insights into human cognition of similarity. Across two racing games and seven Atari games, our techniques significantly improve the precision of zero-shot playstyle classification, achieving an accuracy exceeding 90 percent with fewer than 512 observation-action pairs, which is less than half an episode of these games. Furthermore, our experiments with 2048 and Go demonstrate the potential of discrete playstyle measures in puzzle and board games. We also develop an algorithm for assessing decision-making diversity using these measures. Our findings improve the measurement of end-to-end game analysis and the evolution of artificial intelligence for diverse playstyles.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose RHEA CL, which combines Curriculum Learning (CL) with Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms (RHEA) to automatically produce effective curricula during the training of a reinforcement learning agent. RHEA CL optimizes a population of curricula, using an evolutionary algorithm, and selects the best-performing curriculum as the starting point for the next training epoch. Performance evaluations are conducted after every curriculum step in all environments. We evaluate the algorithm on the \textit{DoorKey} and \textit{DynamicObstacles} environments within the Minigrid framework. It demonstrates adaptability and consistent improvement, particularly in the early stages, while reaching a stable performance later that is capable of outperforming other curriculum learners. In comparison to other curriculum schedules, RHEA CL has been shown to yield performance improvements for the final Reinforcement learning (RL) agent at the cost of additional evaluation during training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jean-Marie Lagniez, Pierre Marquis, Armin Biere</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of blocked clause elimination for projected model counting. This is the problem of determining the number of models ||\exists X.{\Sigma}|| of a propositional formula {\Sigma} after eliminating a given set X of variables existentially. Although blocked clause elimination is a well-known technique for SAT solving, its direct application to model counting is challenging as in general it changes the number of models. However, we demonstrate, by focusing on projected variables during the blocked clause search, that blocked clause elimination can be leveraged while preserving the correct model count. To take advantage of blocked clause elimination in an efficient way during model counting, a novel data structure and associated algorithms are introduced. Our proposed approach is implemented in the model counter d4. Our experiments demonstrate the computational benefits of our new method of blocked clause elimination for projected model counting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjie Xu, Diego Perez-Liebana, Alexander Dockhorn</p>
<p>Abstract: Playing strategy games is a challenging problem for artificial intelligence (AI). One of the major challenges is the large search space due to a diverse set of game components. In recent works, state abstraction has been applied to search-based game AI and has brought significant performance improvements. State abstraction techniques rely on reducing the search space, e.g., by aggregating similar states. However, the application of these abstractions is hindered because the quality of an abstraction is difficult to evaluate. Previous works hence abandon the abstraction in the middle of the search to not bias the search to a local optimum. This mechanism introduces a hyper-parameter to decide the time to abandon the current state abstraction. In this work, we propose a size-constrained state abstraction (SCSA), an approach that limits the maximum number of nodes being grouped together. We found that with SCSA, the abstraction is not required to be abandoned. Our empirical results on $3$ strategy games show that the SCSA agent outperforms the previous methods and yields robust performance over different games.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster, Jeff Clune, David Ha</p>
<p>Abstract: One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanan Chen, Ali Pesaranghader, Tanmana Sadhu, Dong Hoon Yi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have brought autonomous agents closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their promising generalization and emergent capabilities. There is, however, a lack of studies on how LLM-based agents behave, why they could potentially fail, and how to improve them, particularly in demanding real-world planning tasks. In this paper, as an effort to fill the gap, we present our study using a realistic benchmark, TravelPlanner, where an agent must meet multiple constraints to generate accurate plans. We leverage this benchmark to address four key research questions: (1) are LLM agents robust enough to lengthy and noisy contexts when it comes to reasoning and planning? (2) can few-shot prompting adversely impact the performance of LLM agents in scenarios with long context? (3) can we rely on refinement to improve plans, and (4) can fine-tuning LLMs with both positive and negative feedback lead to further improvement? Our comprehensive experiments indicate that, firstly, LLMs often fail to attend to crucial parts of a long context, despite their ability to handle extensive reference information and few-shot examples; secondly, they still struggle with analyzing the long plans and cannot provide accurate feedback for refinement; thirdly, we propose Feedback-Aware Fine-Tuning (FAFT), which leverages both positive and negative feedback, resulting in substantial gains over Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our findings offer in-depth insights to the community on various aspects related to real-world planning applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have ushered in a new era in artificial intelligence, merging capabilities in both language and vision to form highly capable Visual Foundation Agents. These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ilyass Hammouamri, Ismail Khalfaoui-Hassani, Timoth\'ee Masquelier</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising research direction for building power-efficient information processing systems, especially for temporal tasks such as speech recognition. In SNNs, delays refer to the time needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights - one per synapse - whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and its non-spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, which require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or three hidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We showed that fixed random delays help and that learning them helps even more. Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in the three datasets without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters. Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate and precise models for temporal data processing.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Micheline B\'en\'edicte Moumoula, Abdoul Kader Kabore, Jacques Klein, Tegawend\'e Bissyande</p>
<p>Abstract: With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction with the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection.
  We investigate the capabilities of four (04) LLMs and eight (08) prompts for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. Both studies (based on LLMs and Embedding models) are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.98, for straightforward programming examples (e.g., from XLCoST). However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of code clones in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~2 and ~24 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshansh Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to predicting mechanical properties of Additive Friction Stir Deposited (AFSD) aluminum alloy walled structures using biomimetic machine learning. The research combines numerical modeling of the AFSD process with genetic algorithm-optimized machine learning models to predict von Mises stress and logarithmic strain. Finite element analysis was employed to simulate the AFSD process for five aluminum alloys: AA2024, AA5083, AA5086, AA7075, and AA6061, capturing complex thermal and mechanical interactions. A dataset of 200 samples was generated from these simulations. Subsequently, Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) regression models, optimized using genetic algorithms, were developed to predict key mechanical properties. The GA-RF model demonstrated superior performance in predicting both von Mises stress (R square = 0.9676) and logarithmic strain (R square = 0.7201). This innovative approach provides a powerful tool for understanding and optimizing the AFSD process across multiple aluminum alloys, offering insights into material behavior under various process parameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joshua Morriss, Tod Brindle, Jessica Bah R\"osman, Daniel Reibsamen, Andreas Enz</p>
<p>Abstract: Systematic literature reviews are the highest quality of evidence in research. However, the review process is hindered by significant resource and data constraints. The Literature Review Network (LRN) is the first of its kind explainable AI platform adhering to PRISMA 2020 standards, designed to automate the entire literature review process. LRN was evaluated in the domain of surgical glove practices using 3 search strings developed by experts to query PubMed. A non-expert trained all LRN models. Performance was benchmarked against an expert manual review. Explainability and performance metrics assessed LRN's ability to replicate the experts' review. Concordance was measured with the Jaccard index and confusion matrices. Researchers were blinded to the other's results until study completion. Overlapping studies were integrated into an LRN-generated systematic review. LRN models demonstrated superior classification accuracy without expert training, achieving 84.78% and 85.71% accuracy. The highest performance model achieved high interrater reliability (k = 0.4953) and explainability metrics, linking 'reduce', 'accident', and 'sharp' with 'double-gloving'. Another LRN model covered 91.51% of the relevant literature despite diverging from the non-expert's judgments (k = 0.2174), with the terms 'latex', 'double' (gloves), and 'indication'. LRN outperformed the manual review (19,920 minutes over 11 months), reducing the entire process to 288.6 minutes over 5 days. This study demonstrates that explainable AI does not require expert training to successfully conduct PRISMA-compliant systematic literature reviews like an expert. LRN summarized the results of surgical glove studies and identified themes that were nearly identical to the clinical researchers' findings. Explainable AI can accurately expedite our understanding of clinical practices, potentially revolutionizing healthcare research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nunzio Lore (Sepehr),  Alireza (Sepehr),  Ilami, Babak Heydari</p>
<p>Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state of the art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, simulation-ready agents by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine a social context with a social dilemma, recording its answers, and using them for Q\&A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model exhibited significant performance closer to that of its larger relative, and that their improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a \%46 improvement in aligning with the behavior of the larger model, with \%100 representing complete alignment. This suggests that our pipeline represents an efficient method to transmit some form of theory of mind to smaller models, creating improved and cheaply deployable algorithms in the process. Despite their simplicity and their associated shortcomings and limitations, our findings represent a stepping stone in the pursuit and training of specialized models for strategic and social decision making.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qixuan Yu, Xirui Tang, Feiyang Li, Zinan Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper explores an improved Adaboost algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), which aims to improve the prediction accuracy of user clicks on web page advertisements. By comparing it with several common machine learning algorithms, the paper analyses the advantages of the new model in ad click prediction. It is shown that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper performs well in user ad click prediction with an accuracy of 92%, which is an improvement of 13.6% compared to the highest of 78.4% among the other three base models. This significant improvement indicates that the algorithm is more capable of capturing user behavioural characteristics and time series patterns. In addition, this paper evaluates the model's performance on other performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the improved Adaboost algorithm based on LSTM is significantly ahead of the traditional model in all these metrics, which further validates its effectiveness and superiority. Especially when facing complex and dynamically changing user behaviours, the model is able to better adapt and make accurate predictions. In order to ensure the practicality and reliability of the model, this study also focuses on the accuracy difference between the training set and the test set. After validation, the accuracy of the proposed model on these two datasets only differs by 1.7%, which is a small difference indicating that the model has good generalisation ability and can be effectively applied to real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ferdinando Fioretto, Diptangshu Sen, Juba Ziani</p>
<p>Abstract: Networks are crucial components of many sectors, including telecommunications, healthcare, finance, energy, and transportation.The information carried in such networks often contains sensitive user data, like location data for commuters and packet data for online users. Therefore, when considering data release for networks, one must ensure that data release mechanisms do not leak information about individuals, quantified in a precise mathematical sense. Differential Privacy (DP) is the widely accepted, formal, state-of-the-art technique, which has found use in a variety of real-life settings including the 2020 U.S. Census, Apple users' device data, or Google's location data. Yet, the use of DP comes with new challenges, as the noise added for privacy introduces inaccuracies or biases and further, DP techniques can also distribute these biases disproportionately across different populations, inducing fairness issues. The goal of this paper is to characterize the impact of DP on bias and unfairness in the context of releasing information about networks, taking a departure from previous work which has studied these effects in the context of private population counts release (such as in the U.S. Census). To this end, we consider a network release problem where the network structure is known to all, but the weights on edges must be released privately. We consider the impact of this private release on a simple downstream decision-making task run by a third-party, which is to find the shortest path between any two pairs of nodes and recommend the best route to users. This setting is of highly practical relevance, mirroring scenarios in transportation networks, where preserving privacy while providing accurate routing information is crucial. Our work provides theoretical foundations and empirical evidence into the bias and unfairness arising due to privacy in these networked decision problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Colocrese, Erdem Koyuncu, Hulya Seferoglu</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed inference techniques can be broadly classified into data-distributed and model-distributed schemes. In data-distributed inference (DDI), each worker carries the entire deep neural network (DNN) model but processes only a subset of the data. However, feeding the data to workers results in high communication costs, especially when the data is large. An emerging paradigm is model-distributed inference (MDI), where each worker carries only a subset of DNN layers. In MDI, a source device that has data processes a few layers of DNN and sends the output to a neighboring device, i.e., offloads the rest of the layers. This process ends when all layers are processed in a distributed manner. In this paper, we investigate the design and development of MDI with early-exit, which advocates that there is no need to process all the layers of a model for some data to reach the desired accuracy, i.e., we can exit the model without processing all the layers if target accuracy is reached. We design a framework MDI-Exit that adaptively determines early-exit and offloading policies as well as data admission at the source. Experimental results on a real-life testbed of NVIDIA Nano edge devices show that MDI-Exit processes more data when accuracy is fixed and results in higher accuracy for the fixed data rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abraham Itzhak Weinberg</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the threat facing airports from growing and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks has become evident. Airports are considered a strategic national asset, so protecting them from attacks, specifically cyberattacks, is a crucial mission. One way to increase airports' security is by using Digital Twins (DTs). This paper shows and demonstrates how DTs can enhance the security mission. The integration of DTs with Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms can lead to synergy and new frontiers in fighting cyberattacks. The paper exemplifies ways to model cyberattack scenarios using simulations and generate synthetic data for testing defenses. It also discusses how DTs can be used as a crucial tool for vulnerability assessment by identifying weaknesses, prioritizing, and accelerating remediations in case of cyberattacks. Moreover, the paper demonstrates approaches for anomaly detection and threat hunting using Machine Learning (ML) and GenAI algorithms. Additionally, the paper provides impact prediction and recovery coordination methods that can be used by DT operators and stakeholders. It also introduces ways to harness the human factor by integrating training and simulation algorithms with Explainable AI (XAI) into the DT platforms. Lastly, the paper offers future applications and technologies that can be utilized in DT environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of centralised machine learning (ML) in oncology, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns and harnessing the power of diverse, multi-center data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on the state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Distinct from previous surveys, our comprehensive review critically evaluates the real-world implementation and impact of FL on cancer care, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability, performance and data privacy in clinical settings and data. We evaluated state-of-the-art advances in FL, demonstrating its growing adoption amid tightening data privacy regulations. FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of the 25 studies reviewed, spanning diverse ML models and clinical applications, and facilitating integration of multi-modal information for precision medicine. Despite the current challenges identified in reproducibility, standardisation and methodology across studies, the demonstrable benefits of FL in harnessing real-world data and addressing clinical needs highlight its significant potential for advancing cancer research. We propose that future research should focus on addressing these limitations and investigating further advanced FL methods, to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenwen Min, Zhen Wang, Fangfang Zhu, Taosheng Xu, Shunfang Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis is pivotal for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, the high sparsity and complex noise patterns inherent in scRNA-seq data present significant challenges for traditional clustering methods. To address these issues, we propose a deep clustering method, Attention-Enhanced Structural Deep Embedding Graph Clustering (scASDC), which integrates multiple advanced modules to improve clustering accuracy and robustness.Our approach employs a multi-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture high-order structural relationships between cells, termed as the graph autoencoder module. To mitigate the oversmoothing issue in GCNs, we introduce a ZINB-based autoencoder module that extracts content information from the data and learns latent representations of gene expression. These modules are further integrated through an attention fusion mechanism, ensuring effective combination of gene expression and structural information at each layer of the GCN. Additionally, a self-supervised learning module is incorporated to enhance the robustness of the learned embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scASDC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and effective solution for single-cell clustering tasks. Our method paves the way for more accurate and meaningful analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, contributing to better understanding of cellular heterogeneity and biological processes.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philipp Wu, Kourosh Hakhamaneshi, Yuqing Du, Igor Mordatch, Aravind Rajeswaran, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: One-shot Imitation Learning~(OSIL) aims to imbue AI agents with the ability to learn a new task from a single demonstration. To supervise the learning, OSIL typically requires a prohibitively large number of paired expert demonstrations -- i.e. trajectories corresponding to different variations of the same semantic task. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the semi-supervised OSIL problem setting, where the learning agent is presented with a large dataset of trajectories with no task labels (i.e. an unpaired dataset), along with a small dataset of multiple demonstrations per semantic task (i.e. a paired dataset). This presents a more realistic and practical embodiment of few-shot learning and requires the agent to effectively leverage weak supervision from a large dataset of trajectories. Subsequently, we develop an algorithm specifically applicable to this semi-supervised OSIL setting. Our approach first learns an embedding space where different tasks cluster uniquely. We utilize this embedding space and the clustering it supports to self-generate pairings between trajectories in the large unpaired dataset. Through empirical results on simulated control tasks, we demonstrate that OSIL models trained on such self-generated pairings are competitive with OSIL models trained with ground-truth labels, presenting a major advancement in the label-efficiency of OSIL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bj\"orn L\"utjens, Raffaele Ferrari, Duncan Watson-Parris, Noelle Selin</p>
<p>Abstract: Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We implement a linear regression-based emulator, akin to pattern scaling, and find that it outperforms the incumbent 100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4 regionally-resolved surface-level climate variables. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation. We identify that this outcome is a result of high levels of internal variability in the benchmark targets. To address internal variability, we update the benchmark targets with ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model that contain 50 instead of 3 climate simulations per emission pathway. Using the new targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based model for emulating precipitation. We publish our code, data, and an interactive tutorial at github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Mehdi Rahimifar, Hamza Ezzaoui Rahali, Audrey C. Therrien</p>
<p>Abstract: Implementing Machine Learning (ML) models on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is becoming increasingly popular across various domains as a low-latency and low-power solution that helps manage large data rates generated by continuously improving detectors. However, developing ML models for FPGAs is time-consuming, as optimization requires synthesis to evaluate FPGA area and latency, making the process slow and repetitive. This paper introduces a novel method to predict the resource utilization and inference latency of Neural Networks (NNs) before their synthesis and implementation on FPGA. We leverage HLS4ML, a tool-flow that helps translate NNs into high-level synthesis (HLS) code, to synthesize a diverse dataset of NN architectures and train resource utilization and inference latency predictors. While HLS4ML requires full synthesis to obtain resource and latency insights, our method uses trained regression models for immediate pre-synthesis predictions. The prediction models estimate the usage of Block RAM (BRAM), Digital Signal Processors (DSP), Flip-Flops (FF), and Look-Up Tables (LUT), as well as the inference clock cycles. The predictors were evaluated on both synthetic and existing benchmark architectures and demonstrated high accuracy with R2 scores ranging between 0.8 and 0.98 on the validation set and sMAPE values between 10% and 30%. Overall, our approach provides valuable preliminary insights, enabling users to quickly assess the feasibility and efficiency of NNs on FPGAs, accelerating the development and deployment processes.

<p>Abstract: Object detection is crucial in various cutting-edge applications, such as autonomous vehicles and advanced robotics systems, primarily relying on data from conventional frame-based RGB sensors. However, these sensors often struggle with issues like motion blur and poor performance in challenging lighting conditions. In response to these challenges, event-based cameras have emerged as an innovative paradigm. These cameras, mimicking the human eye, demonstrate superior performance in environments with fast motion and extreme lighting conditions while consuming less power. This study introduces ReYOLOv8, an advanced object detection framework that enhances a leading frame-based detection system with spatiotemporal modeling capabilities. We implemented a low-latency, memory-efficient method for encoding event data to boost the system's performance. We also developed a novel data augmentation technique tailored to leverage the unique attributes of event data, thus improving detection accuracy. Our models outperformed all comparable approaches in the GEN1 dataset, focusing on automotive applications, achieving mean Average Precision (mAP) improvements of 5%, 2.8%, and 2.5% across nano, small, and medium scales, respectively.These enhancements were achieved while reducing the number of trainable parameters by an average of 4.43% and maintaining real-time processing speeds between 9.2ms and 15.5ms. On the PEDRo dataset, which targets robotics applications, our models showed mAP improvements ranging from 9% to 18%, with 14.5x and 3.8x smaller models and an average speed enhancement of 1.67x.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to enhance objectivity in organizational task performance evaluations. Through comparative analyses across two studies, including various task performance outputs, we demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a reliable and even superior alternative to human raters in evaluating knowledge-based performance outputs, which are a key contribution of knowledge workers. Our results suggest that GPT ratings are comparable to human ratings but exhibit higher consistency and reliability. Additionally, combined multiple GPT ratings on the same performance output show strong correlations with aggregated human performance ratings, akin to the consensus principle observed in performance evaluation literature. However, we also find that LLMs are prone to contextual biases, such as the halo effect, mirroring human evaluative biases. Our research suggests that while LLMs are capable of extracting meaningful constructs from text-based data, their scope is currently limited to specific forms of performance evaluation. By highlighting both the potential and limitations of LLMs, our study contributes to the discourse on AI role in management studies and sets a foundation for future research to refine AI theoretical and practical applications in management.</p>

Temporal Logic specifications have long provided a way to constrain system behaviors and are a natural fit for these use cases. In this work, we propose a novel approach to factor in signal temporal logic specifications while using autoregressive transformer models for trajectory planning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihyeon Kim, Boryeong Cho, Sangmin Bae, Sumyeong Ahn, Se-Young Yun</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the astonishing performance of recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), these models often generate inaccurate responses. To address this issue, previous studies have focused on mitigating hallucinations by employing contrastive decoding (CD) with augmented images, which amplifies the contrast with the original image. However, these methods have limitations, including reliance on a single augmentation, which is restrictive for certain tasks, as well as the high cost of using external knowledge. In this study, we address these limitations by exploring how to utilize multiple image augmentations. Through extensive experiments, we observed that different augmentations produce varying levels of contrast depending on the task. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel method called VACoDe, Visual Augmented Contrastive Decoding. This method adaptively selects the augmentation with the highest contrast for each task using the proposed softmax distance metric. Our empirical tests show that \alg outperforms previous methods and improves output quality in various vision-language tasks. Additionally, VACoDe can be universally applied across different model types and sizes without additional training or the use of external models and data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinsong Wang, Siyi Du, Shaoming Zheng, Xinzhe Luo, Chen Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-contrast image registration is a challenging task due to the complex intensity relationships between different imaging contrasts. Conventional image registration methods are typically based on iterative optimizations for each input image pair, which is time-consuming and sensitive to contrast variations. While learning-based approaches are much faster during the inference stage, due to generalizability issues, they typically can only be applied to the fixed contrasts observed during the training stage. In this work, we propose a novel contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework that can be generalized to arbitrary contrast images, without observing them during training. Particularly, we propose a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme, which simulates arbitrary contrasts of images over a single image contrast while preserving their inherent structural information. To ensure that the network can learn contrast-invariant representations for facilitating contrast-agnostic registration, we further introduce contrast-invariant latent regularization (CLR) that regularizes representation in latent space through a contrast invariance loss. Experiments show that CAR outperforms the baseline approaches regarding registration accuracy and also possesses better generalization ability to unseen imaging contrasts.

<p>Abstract: When the initial vision of Explainable (XAI) was articulated, the most popular framing was to open the (proverbial) "black-box" of AI so that we could understand the inner workings. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the very ability to open the black-box is increasingly limited especially when it comes to non-AI expert end-users. In this paper, we challenge the assumption of "opening" the black-box in the LLM era and argue for a shift in our XAI expectations. Highlighting the epistemic blind spots of an algorithm-centered XAI view, we argue that a human-centered perspective can be a path forward. We operationalize the argument by synthesizing XAI research along three dimensions: explainability outside the black-box, explainability around the edges of the black box, and explainability that leverages infrastructural seams. We conclude with takeaways that reflexively inform XAI as a domain.</p>

Recent work has highlighted the importance of studying affective trust towards AI, especially in the context of emerging human-like LLMs-powered conversational agents. However, there is a lack of validated and generalizable measures for the two-dimensional construct of trust in AI agents. To address this gap, we developed and validated a set of 27-item semantic differential scales for affective and cognitive trust through a scenario-based survey study. We then further validated and applied the scale through an experiment study. Our empirical findings showed how the emotional and cognitive aspects of trust interact with each other and collectively shape a person's overall trust in AI agents. Our study methodology and findings also provide insights into the capability of the state-of-art LLMs to foster trust through different routes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suyi Zhang, Ekram Alam, Jack Baber, Francesca Bianco, Edward Turner, Maysam Chamanzar, Hamid Dehghani</p>
<p>Abstract: In the coming decade, artificial intelligence systems will continue to improve and revolutionise every industry and facet of human life. Designing effective, seamless and symbiotic communication paradigms between humans and AI agents is increasingly important. This paper reports a novel method for human-AI interaction by developing a direct brain-AI interface. We discuss a novel AI model, called MindSpeech, which enables open-vocabulary, continuous decoding for imagined speech. This study focuses on enhancing human-AI communication by utilising high-density functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data to develop an AI model capable of decoding imagined speech non-invasively. We discuss a new word cloud paradigm for data collection, improving the quality and variety of imagined sentences generated by participants and covering a broad semantic space. Utilising a prompt tuning-based approach, we employed the Llama2 large language model (LLM) for text generation guided by brain signals. Our results show significant improvements in key metrics, such as BLEU-1 and BERT P scores, for three out of four participants, demonstrating the method's effectiveness. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining data from multiple participants enhances the decoder performance, with statistically significant improvements in BERT scores for two participants. Furthermore, we demonstrated significantly above-chance decoding accuracy for imagined speech versus resting conditions and the identified activated brain regions during imagined speech tasks in our study are consistent with the previous studies on brain regions involved in speech encoding. This study underscores the feasibility of continuous imagined speech decoding. By integrating high-density fNIRS with advanced AI techniques, we highlight the potential for non-invasive, accurate communication systems with AI in the near future.</p>

<p>Abstract: Financial report generation using general purpose large language models pose two major challenges, including the lack of compound sentences and hallucinations. Advanced prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques are incapable of curing the writing style discrepancies. In this work we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning process wherein public domain financial reports are processed into prompt-completions and augmented using simple LLM prompts to then enable sectional financial report generation using minimal instructions and tabular data inputs. Our proposed fine-tuning framework results doubles the number of correct questions answers and reduces hallucinations by over 50%. Additionally, the two-stage fine tuned models have lower perplexity, improved ROUGE, TER and BLEU scores, higher creativity and knowledge density with lower uncertainty and cross entropy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> The Anh Han, Manh Hong Duong, Matjaz Perc</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours among self-interested individuals is an important problem in many scientific disciplines. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolution of such behaviours, primarily seeking the conditions under which a given mechanism can induce highest levels of cooperation. As these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is however possible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare -- the later broadly defined as the total population payoff, taking into account all costs involved for inducing increased prosocial behaviours. Herein, by comparatively analysing the social welfare and cooperation levels obtained from stochastic evolutionary models of two well-established mechanisms of prosocial behaviour, namely, peer and institutional incentives, we demonstrate exactly that. We show that the objectives of maximising cooperation levels and the objectives of maximising social welfare are often misaligned. We argue for the need of adopting social welfare as the main optimisation objective when designing and implementing evolutionary mechanisms for social and collective goods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhi Zhong, Jichang Li, Yinqi Cai, Liang Lin, Guanbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven lip sync has recently drawn significant attention due to its widespread application in the multimedia domain. Individuals exhibit distinct lip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking styles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync. Earlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized speaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general styles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary audio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not preserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation. This work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that effectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio from style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip sync. Specifically, we first develop an advanced Transformer-based model adept at predicting lip motion corresponding to the input audio, augmented by the style information aggregated through cross-attention layers from style reference video. Afterwards, to better render the lip motion into realistic talking face video, we devise a conditional latent diffusion model, integrating lip motion through modulated convolutional layers and fusing reference facial images via spatial cross-attention layers. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving precise lip sync, preserving speaking styles, and generating high-fidelity, realistic talking face videos.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weizhi Zhong, Junfan Lin, Peixin Chen, Liang Lin, Guanbin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-driven talking face video generation has attracted increasing attention due to its huge industrial potential. Some previous methods focus on learning a direct mapping from audio to visual content. Despite progress, they often struggle with the ambiguity of the mapping process, leading to flawed results. An alternative strategy involves facial structural representations (e.g., facial landmarks) as intermediaries. This multi-stage approach better preserves the appearance details but suffers from error accumulation due to the independent optimization of different stages. Moreover, most previous methods rely on generative adversarial networks, prone to training instability and mode collapse. To address these challenges, our study proposes a novel landmark-based diffusion model for talking face generation, which leverages facial landmarks as intermediate representations while enabling end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we first establish the less ambiguous mapping from audio to landmark motion of lip and jaw. Then, we introduce an innovative conditioning module called TalkFormer to align the synthesized motion with the motion represented by landmarks via differentiable cross-attention, which enables end-to-end optimization for improved lip synchronization. Besides, TalkFormer employs implicit feature warping to align the reference image features with the target motion for preserving more appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can synthesize high-fidelity and lip-synced talking face videos, preserving more subject appearance details from the reference image.</p>

<p>Abstract: Existing multimodal-based human action recognition approaches are either computationally expensive, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios, or fail to exploit the spatial temporal information of multiple data modalities. In this work, we present an efficient pose-driven attention-guided multimodal network (EPAM-Net) for action recognition in videos. Specifically, we adapted X3D networks for both RGB and pose streams to capture spatio-temporal features from RGB videos and their skeleton sequences. Then skeleton features are utilized to help the visual network stream focusing on key frames and their salient spatial regions using a spatial temporal attention block. Finally, the scores of the two streams of the proposed network are fused for final classification. The experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance on NTU-D 60 and NTU RGB-D 120 benchmark datasets. Moreover, our model provides a 6.2--9.9x reduction in FLOPs (floating-point operation, in number of multiply-adds) and a 9--9.6x reduction in the number of network parameters.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaarel H\"anni, Jake Mendel, Dmitry Vaintrob, Lawrence Chan</p>
<p>Abstract: Superposition -- when a neural network represents more ``features'' than it has dimensions -- seems to pose a serious challenge to mechanistically interpreting current AI systems. Existing theory work studies \emph{representational} superposition, where superposition is only used when passing information through bottlenecks. In this work, we present mathematical models of \emph{computation} in superposition, where superposition is actively helpful for efficiently accomplishing the task.
  We first construct a task of efficiently emulating a circuit that takes the AND of the $\binom{m}{2}$ pairs of each of $m$ features. We construct a 1-layer MLP that uses superposition to perform this task up to $\varepsilon$-error, where the network only requires $\tilde{O}(m^{\frac{2}{3}})$ neurons, even when the input features are \emph{themselves in superposition}. We generalize this construction to arbitrary sparse boolean circuits of low depth, and then construct ``error correction'' layers that allow deep fully-connected networks of width $d$ to emulate circuits of width $\tilde{O}(d^{1.5})$ and \emph{any} polynomial depth. We conclude by providing some potential applications of our work for interpreting neural networks that implement computation in superposition.</p>

<p>Abstract: Inspired by the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in NLP tasks, there's growing interest in applying LLMs to graph-related tasks. This study delves into the capabilities of instruction-following LLMs for engaging with real-world graphs, aiming to offer empirical insights into how LLMs can effectively interact with graphs and generalize across graph tasks. We begin by constructing a dataset designed for instruction tuning, which comprises a diverse collection of 79 graph-related tasks from academic and e-commerce domains, featuring 44,240 training instances and 18,960 test samples. Utilizing this benchmark, our initial investigation focuses on identifying the optimal graph representation that serves as a conduit for LLMs to understand complex graph structures. Our findings indicate that JSON format for graph representation consistently outperforms natural language and code formats across various LLMs and graph types. Furthermore, we examine the key factors that influence the generalization abilities of instruction-tuned LLMs by evaluating their performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain graph tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Image generation using generative artificial intelligence is a popular activity. However, it is almost exclusively performed in the privacy of an individual's home via typing on a keyboard. In this article, we explore body prompting as input for image generation. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our results from a sample of visitors (N=79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience. We identify three distinct patterns of embodied interaction with the generative AI and present insights into participants' experience of body prompting and AI co-creation. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and other public cultural spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehong Cho, Minsu Kim, Hyunmin Choi, Guseul Heo, Jongse Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been an extensive research effort in building efficient large language model (LLM) inference serving systems. These efforts not only include innovations in the algorithm and software domains but also constitute developments of various hardware acceleration techniques. Nevertheless, there is a lack of simulation infrastructure capable of accurately modeling versatile hardware-software behaviors in LLM serving systems without extensively extending the simulation time. This paper aims to develop an effective simulation tool, called LLMServingSim, to support future research in LLM serving systems. In designing LLMServingSim, we focus on two limitations of existing simulators: (1) they lack consideration of the dynamic workload variations of LLM inference serving due to its autoregressive nature, and (2) they incur repetitive simulations without leveraging algorithmic redundancies in LLMs. To address these limitations, LLMServingSim simulates the LLM serving in the granularity of iterations, leveraging the computation redundancies across decoder blocks and reusing the simulation results from previous iterations. Additionally, LLMServingSim provides a flexible framework that allows users to plug in any accelerator compiler-and-simulation stacks for exploring various system designs with heterogeneous processors. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMServingSim produces simulation results closely following the performance behaviors of real GPU-based LLM serving system with less than 14.7% error rate, while offering 91.5x faster simulation speed compared to existing accelerator simulators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Cheng Wei, Yang Wang, Kuofeng Gao, Shuo Shao, Yiming Li, Zhibo Wang, Zhan Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, point clouds have been widely used in computer vision, whereas their collection is time-consuming and expensive. As such, point cloud datasets are the valuable intellectual property of their owners and deserve protection. To detect and prevent unauthorized use of these datasets, especially for commercial or open-sourced ones that cannot be sold again or used commercially without permission, we intend to identify whether a suspicious third-party model is trained on our protected dataset under the black-box setting. We achieve this goal by designing a scalable clean-label backdoor-based dataset watermark for point clouds that ensures both effectiveness and stealthiness. Unlike existing clean-label watermark schemes, which are susceptible to the number of categories, our method could watermark samples from all classes instead of only from the target one. Accordingly, it can still preserve high effectiveness even on large-scale datasets with many classes. Specifically, we perturb selected point clouds with non-target categories in both shape-wise and point-wise manners before inserting trigger patterns without changing their labels. The features of perturbed samples are similar to those of benign samples from the target class. As such, models trained on the watermarked dataset will have a distinctive yet stealthy backdoor behavior, i.e., misclassifying samples from the target class whenever triggers appear, since the trained DNNs will treat the inserted trigger pattern as a signal to deny predicting the target label. We also design a hypothesis-test-guided dataset ownership verification based on the proposed watermark. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential removal methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuohang Dang, Minnan Luo, Jihong Wang, Chengyou Jia, Haochen Han, Herun Wan, Guang Dai, Xiaojun Chang, Jingdong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval is crucial in understanding latent correspondences across modalities. However, existing methods implicitly assume well-matched training data, which is impractical as real-world data inevitably involves imperfect alignments, i.e., noisy correspondences. Although some works explore similarity-based strategies to address such noise, they suffer from sub-optimal similarity predictions influenced by modality-exclusive information (MEI), e.g., background noise in images and abstract definitions in texts. This issue arises as MEI is not shared across modalities, thus aligning it in training can markedly mislead similarity predictions. Moreover, although intuitive, directly applying previous cross-modal disentanglement methods suffers from limited noise tolerance and disentanglement efficacy. Inspired by the robustness of information bottlenecks against noise, we introduce DisNCL, a novel information-theoretic framework for feature Disentanglement in Noisy Correspondence Learning, to adaptively balance the extraction of MII and MEI with certifiable optimal cross-modal disentanglement efficacy. DisNCL then enhances similarity predictions in modality-invariant subspace, thereby greatly boosting similarity-based alleviation strategy for noisy correspondences. Furthermore, DisNCL introduces soft matching targets to model noisy many-to-many relationships inherent in multi-modal input for noise-robust and accurate cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments confirm DisNCL's efficacy by 2% average recall improvement. Mutual information estimation and visualization results show that DisNCL learns meaningful MII/MEI subspaces, validating our theoretical analyses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining high-resolution 3D biomolecular structures from imaging data. As this technique can capture dynamic biomolecular complexes, 3D reconstruction methods are increasingly being developed to resolve this intrinsic structural heterogeneity. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks with ground truth structures and validation metrics limits the advancement of the field. Here, we propose CryoBench, a suite of datasets, metrics, and performance benchmarks for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM. We propose five datasets representing different sources of heterogeneity and degrees of difficulty. These include conformational heterogeneity generated from simple motions and random configurations of antibody complexes and from tens of thousands of structures sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation. We also design datasets containing compositional heterogeneity from mixtures of ribosome assembly states and 100 common complexes present in cells. We then perform a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art heterogeneous reconstruction tools including neural and non-neural methods and their sensitivity to noise, and propose new metrics for quantitative comparison of methods. We hope that this benchmark will be a foundational resource for analyzing existing methods and new algorithmic development in both the cryo-EM and machine learning communities.</p>

In addition, existing work has not effectively utilized trigger word information explicitly. Hence, we propose MLSL, a method based on multi-layer sequence labeling for joint biomedical event extraction. MLSL does not introduce prior knowledge and complex structures. Moreover, it explicitly incorporates the information of candidate trigger words into the sequence labeling to learn the interaction relationships between trigger words and argument roles. Based on this, MLSL can learn well with just a simple workflow. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the superiority of MLSL in terms of extraction performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yisheng Yang, Guodong Du, Chean Khim Toa, Ho-Kin Tang, Sim Kuan Goh</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates neural network design by using optimization algorithms to navigate architecture spaces, reducing the burden of manual architecture design. While NAS has achieved success, applying it to emerging domains, such as analyzing unstructured 3D point clouds, remains underexplored due to the data lying in non-Euclidean spaces, unlike images. This paper presents Success-History-based Self-adaptive Differential Evolution with a Joint Point Interaction Dimension Search (SHSADE-PIDS), an evolutionary NAS framework that encodes discrete deep neural network architectures to continuous spaces and performs searches in the continuous spaces for efficient point cloud neural architectures. Comprehensive experiments on challenging 3D segmentation and classification benchmarks demonstrate SHSADE-PIDS's capabilities. It discovered highly efficient architectures with higher accuracy, significantly advancing prior NAS techniques. For segmentation on SemanticKITTI, SHSADE-PIDS attained 64.51% mean IoU using only 0.55M parameters and 4.5GMACs, reducing overhead by over 22-26X versus other top methods. For ModelNet40 classification, it achieved 93.4% accuracy with just 1.31M parameters, surpassing larger models. SHSADE-PIDS provided valuable insights into bridging evolutionary algorithms with neural architecture optimization, particularly for emerging frontiers like point cloud learning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Darwinian evolution of the biological brain is documented through multiple lines of evidence, although the modes of evolutionary changes remain unclear. Drawing inspiration from the evolved neural systems (e.g., visual cortex), deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in visual tasks, among others. While the success of training deep neural networks has been relying on back-propagation (BP) and its variants to learn representations from data, BP does not incorporate the evolutionary processes that govern biological neural systems. This work proposes a neural network optimization framework based on evolutionary theory. Specifically, BP-trained deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks obtained from the ending epochs are considered the primordial ancestors (initial population). Subsequently, the population evolved with differential evolution. Extensive experiments are carried out to examine the relationships between Darwinian evolution and neural network optimization, including the correspondence between datasets, environment, models, and living species. The empirical results show that the proposed framework has positive impacts on the network, with reduced over-fitting and an order of magnitude lower time complexity compared to BP. Moreover, the experiments show that the proposed framework performs well on deep neural networks and big datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in document-level event extraction tasks, but existing methods face challenges in the design of prompts. To address this issue, we propose an optimization strategy called "Definition-driven Document-level Event Extraction (DDEE)." By adjusting the length of the prompt and enhancing the clarity of heuristics, we have significantly improved the event extraction performance of LLMs. We used data balancing techniques to solve the long-tail effect problem, enhancing the model's generalization ability for event types. At the same time, we refined the prompt to ensure it is both concise and comprehensive, adapting to the sensitivity of LLMs to the style of prompts. In addition, the introduction of structured heuristic methods and strict limiting conditions has improved the precision of event and argument role extraction. These strategies not only solve the prompt engineering problems of LLMs in document-level event extraction but also promote the development of event extraction technology, providing new research perspectives for other tasks in the NLP field.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper explores self-supervised disentangled representation learning within sequential data, focusing on separating time-independent and time-varying factors in videos. We propose a new model that breaks the usual independence assumption between those factors by explicitly accounting for the causal relationship between the static/dynamic variables and that improves the model expressivity through additional Normalizing Flows. A formal definition of the factors is proposed. This formalism leads to the derivation of sufficient conditions for the ground truth factors to be identifiable, and to the introduction of a novel theoretically grounded disentanglement constraint that can be directly and efficiently incorporated into our new framework. The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms previous complex state-of-the-art techniques in scenarios where the dynamics of a scene are influenced by its content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Obozov, Makar Baderko, Stepan Kulibaba, Nikolay Kutuzov, Alexander Gasnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Recommender systems aim to estimate the dynamically changing user preferences and sequential dependencies between historical user behaviour and metadata. Although transformer-based models have proven to be effective in sequential recommendations, their state growth is proportional to the length of the sequence that is being processed, which makes them expensive in terms of memory and inference costs. Our research focused on three promising directions in sequential recommendations: enhancing speed through the use of State Space Models (SSM), as they can achieve SOTA results in the sequential recommendations domain with lower latency, memory, and inference costs, as proposed by arXiv:2403.03900 improving the quality of recommendations with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model (ORPO); and implementing adaptive batch- and step-size algorithms to reduce costs and accelerate training processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vindula Jayawardana, Baptiste Freydt, Ao Qu, Cameron Hickert, Edgar Sanchez, Catherine Tang, Mark Taylor, Blaine Leonard, Cathy Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Connor Mattson, Anurag Aribandi, Daniel S. Brown</p>
<p>Abstract: We study the problem of cross-embodiment inverse reinforcement learning, where we wish to learn a reward function from video demonstrations in one or more embodiments and then transfer the learned reward to a different embodiment (e.g., different action space, dynamics, size, shape, etc.). Learning reward functions that transfer across embodiments is important in settings such as teaching a robot a policy via human video demonstrations or teaching a robot to imitate a policy from another robot with a different embodiment. However, prior work has only focused on cases where near-optimal demonstrations are available, which is often difficult to ensure. By contrast, we study the setting of cross-embodiment reward learning from mixed-quality demonstrations. We demonstrate that prior work struggles to learn generalizable reward representations when learning from mixed-quality data. We then analyze several techniques that leverage human feedback for representation learning and alignment to enable effective cross-embodiment learning. Our results give insight into how different representation learning techniques lead to qualitatively different reward shaping behaviors and the importance of human feedback when learning from mixed-quality, mixed-embodiment data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqiu Chen, Xuebin Yao, Pradeep Subedi, Cong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that collects and processes data at or near the source of data generation. The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharclab/Residual-INR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kai Yu, Yang Zhou, Yang Bai, Zhi Da Soh, Xinxing Xu, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Ching-Yu Cheng, Yong Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retinal foundation models aim to learn generalizable representations from diverse retinal images, facilitating label-efficient model adaptation across various ophthalmic tasks. Despite their success, current retinal foundation models are generally restricted to a single imaging modality, such as Color Fundus Photography (CFP) or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), limiting their versatility. Moreover, these models may struggle to fully leverage expert annotations and overlook the valuable domain knowledge essential for domain-specific representation learning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UrFound, a retinal foundation model designed to learn universal representations from both multimodal retinal images and domain knowledge. UrFound is equipped with a modality-agnostic image encoder and accepts either CFP or OCT images as inputs. To integrate domain knowledge into representation learning, we encode expert annotation in text supervision and propose a knowledge-guided masked modeling strategy for model pre-training. It involves reconstructing randomly masked patches of retinal images while predicting masked text tokens conditioned on the corresponding retinal image. This approach aligns multimodal images and textual expert annotations within a unified latent space, facilitating generalizable and domain-specific representation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that UrFound exhibits strong generalization ability and data efficiency when adapting to various tasks in retinal image analysis. By training on ~180k retinal images, UrFound significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art retinal foundation model trained on up to 1.6 million unlabelled images across 8 public retinal datasets.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ben Harkin, Xueqin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper undertakes a comprehensive investigation of electricity price forecasting methods, focused on the Irish Integrated Single Electricity Market, particularly on changes during recent periods of high volatility. The primary objective of this research is to evaluate and compare the performance of various forecasting models, ranging from traditional machine learning models to more complex neural networks, as well as the impact of different lengths of training periods. The performance metrics, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and relative mean absolute error, are utilized to assess and compare the accuracy of each model. A comprehensive set of input features was investigated and selected from data recorded between October 2018 and September 2022. The paper demonstrates that the daily EU Natural Gas price is a more useful feature for electricity price forecasting in Ireland than the daily Henry Hub Natural Gas price. This study also shows that the correlation of features to the day-ahead market price has changed in recent years. The price of natural gas on the day and the amount of wind energy on the grid that hour are significantly more important than any other features. More specifically speaking, the input fuel for electricity has become a more important driver of the price of it, than the total generation or demand. In addition, it can be seen that System Non-Synchronous Penetration (SNSP) is highly correlated with the day-ahead market price, and that renewables are pushing down the price of electricity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kfir Sulimany, Sri Krishna Vadlamani, Ryan Hamerly, Prahlad Iyengar, Dirk Englund</p>
<p>Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present PRTGaussian, a realtime relightable novel-view synthesis method made possible by combining 3D Gaussians and Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT). By fitting relightable Gaussians to multi-view OLAT data, our method enables real-time, free-viewpoint relighting. By estimating the radiance transfer based on high-order spherical harmonics, we achieve a balance between capturing detailed relighting effects and maintaining computational efficiency. We utilize a two-stage process: in the first stage, we reconstruct a coarse geometry of the object from multi-view images. In the second stage, we initialize 3D Gaussians with the obtained point cloud, then simultaneously refine the coarse geometry and learn the light transport for each Gaussian. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets show that our approach can achieve fast and high-quality relighting for general objects.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soudabeh Mousavi, Dara Rahmati, Saeid Gorgin, Jeong-A Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: In computation-intensive domains such as digital signal processing, encryption, and neural networks, the performance of arithmetic units, including adders and multipliers, is pivotal. Conventional numerical systems often fall short of meeting the efficiency requirements of these applications concerning area, time, and power consumption. Innovative approaches like residue number systems (RNS) and redundant number systems have been introduced to surmount this challenge, markedly elevating computational efficiency. This paper examines from multiple perspectives how the fusion of redundant number systems with RNS (termed R-RNS) can diminish latency and enhance circuit implementation, yielding substantial benefits in practical scenarios. We conduct a comparative analysis of four systems - RNS, redundant number system, Binary Number System (BNS), and Signed-Digit Redundant Residue Number System (SD-RNS)-and appraise SD-RNS through an advanced Deep Neural Network (DNN) utilizing the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our findings are encouraging, demonstrating that SD-RNS attains computational speedups of 1.27 times and 2.25 times over RNS and BNS, respectively, and reduces energy consumption by 60% compared to BNS during sequential addition and multiplication tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Reza Mirzaeifard, Diyako Ghaderyan, Stefan Werner</p>
<p>Abstract: Distributed sensors in the internet-of-things (IoT) generate vast amounts of sparse data. Analyzing this high-dimensional data and identifying relevant predictors pose substantial challenges, especially when data is preferred to remain on the device where it was collected for reasons such as data integrity, communication bandwidth, and privacy. This paper introduces a federated quantile regression algorithm to address these challenges. Quantile regression provides a more comprehensive view of the relationship between variables than mean regression models. However, traditional approaches face difficulties when dealing with nonconvex sparse penalties and the inherent non-smoothness of the loss function. For this purpose, we propose a federated smoothing proximal gradient (FSPG) algorithm that integrates a smoothing mechanism with the proximal gradient framework, thereby enhancing both precision and computational speed. This integration adeptly handles optimization over a network of devices, each holding local data samples, making it particularly effective in federated learning scenarios. The FSPG algorithm ensures steady progress and reliable convergence in each iteration by maintaining or reducing the value of the objective function. By leveraging nonconvex penalties, such as the minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the proposed method can identify and preserve key predictors within sparse models. Comprehensive simulations validate the robust theoretical foundations of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate improved estimation precision and reliable convergence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, an open-source, lightweight Large Language Model (LLM) specifically designed for phishing website detection through contextual analysis of the website. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning models that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to new threats and deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our model utilizes the advanced language processing capabilities of LLMs to learn granular features that are characteristic of phishing attacks. Furthermore, PhishLang operates with minimal data preprocessing and offers performance comparable to leading deep learning tools, while being significantly faster and less resource-intensive. Over a 3.5-month testing period, PhishLang successfully identified approximately 26K phishing URLs, many of which were undetected by popular antiphishing blocklists, thus demonstrating its potential to aid current detection measures. We also evaluate PhishLang against several realistic adversarial attacks and develop six patches that make it very robust against such threats. Furthermore, we integrate PhishLang with GPT-3.5 Turbo to create \textit{explainable blocklisting} - warnings that provide users with contextual information about different features that led to a website being marked as phishing. Finally, we have open-sourced the PhishLang framework and developed a Chromium-based browser extension and URL scanner website, which implement explainable warnings for end-users.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rapid progress in generative models has given rise to the critical task of AI-Generated Content Stealth (AIGC-S), which aims to create AI-generated images that can evade both forensic detectors and human inspection. This task is crucial for understanding the vulnerabilities of existing detection methods and developing more robust techniques. However, current adversarial attacks often introduce visible noise, have poor transferability, and fail to address spectral differences between AI-generated and genuine images. To address this, we propose StealthDiffusion, a framework based on stable diffusion that modifies AI-generated images into high-quality, imperceptible adversarial examples capable of evading state-of-the-art forensic detectors. StealthDiffusion comprises two main components: Latent Adversarial Optimization, which generates adversarial perturbations in the latent space of stable diffusion, and Control-VAE, a module that reduces spectral differences between the generated adversarial images and genuine images without affecting the original diffusion model's generation process. Extensive experiments show that StealthDiffusion is effective in both white-box and black-box settings, transforming AI-generated images into high-quality adversarial forgeries with frequency spectra similar to genuine images. These forgeries are classified as genuine by advanced forensic classifiers and are difficult for humans to distinguish.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite achieving remarkable performance, Federated Learning (FL) encounters two important problems, i.e., low training efficiency and limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose a new FL framework, i.e., FedDUMAP, with three original contributions, to leverage the shared insensitive data on the server in addition to the distributed data in edge devices so as to efficiently train a global model. First, we propose a simple dynamic server update algorithm, which takes advantage of the shared insensitive data on the server while dynamically adjusting the update steps on the server in order to speed up the convergence and improve the accuracy. Second, we propose an adaptive optimization method with the dynamic server update algorithm to exploit the global momentum on the server and each local device for superior accuracy. Third, we develop a layer-adaptive model pruning method to carry out specific pruning operations, which is adapted to the diverse features of each layer so as to attain an excellent trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Our proposed FL model, FedDUMAP, combines the three original techniques and has a significantly better performance compared with baseline approaches in terms of efficiency (up to 16.9 times faster), accuracy (up to 20.4% higher), and computational cost (up to 62.6% smaller).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dandan Zhao, Karthick Sharma, Hongpeng Yin, Yuxin Qi, Shuhao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Fault diagnosis (FD) is essential for maintaining operational safety and minimizing economic losses by detecting system abnormalities. Recently, deep learning (DL)-driven FD methods have gained prominence, offering significant improvements in precision and adaptability through the utilization of extensive datasets and advanced DL models. Modern industrial environments, however, demand FD methods that can handle new fault types, dynamic conditions, large-scale data, and provide real-time responses with minimal prior information. Although online continual learning (OCL) demonstrates potential in addressing these requirements by enabling DL models to continuously learn from streaming data, it faces challenges such as data redundancy, imbalance, and limited labeled data. To overcome these limitations, we propose SRTFD, a scalable real-time fault diagnosis framework that enhances OCL with three critical methods: Retrospect Coreset Selection (RCS), which selects the most relevant data to reduce redundant training and improve efficiency; Global Balance Technique (GBT), which ensures balanced coreset selection and robust model performance; and Confidence and Uncertainty-driven Pseudo-label Learning (CUPL), which updates the model using unlabeled data for continuous adaptation. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset and two public simulated datasets demonstrate SRTFD's effectiveness and potential for providing advanced, scalable, and precise fault diagnosis in modern industrial systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately segmenting different organs from medical images is a critical prerequisite for computer-assisted diagnosis and intervention planning. This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for segmenting various organs from CT and MRI scans and classifying diseases. Our study introduces a novel technique integrating momentum within residual blocks for enhanced training dynamics in medical image analysis. We applied our method in two distinct tasks: segmenting liver, lung, & colon data and classifying abdominal pelvic CT and MRI scans. The proposed approach has shown promising results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on publicly available benchmarking datasets. For instance, in the lung segmentation dataset, our approach yielded significant enhancements over the TransNetR model, including a 5.72% increase in dice score, a 5.04% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), an 8.02% improvement in recall, and a 4.42% improvement in precision. Hence, incorporating momentum led to state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and classification tasks, representing a significant advancement in the field of medical imaging.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become essential in clinical diagnosis due to its high resolution and multiple contrast mechanisms. However, the relatively long acquisition time limits its broader application. To address this issue, this study presents an innovative conditional guided diffusion model, named as TC-KANRecon, which incorporates the Multi-Free U-KAN (MF-UKAN) module and a dynamic clipping strategy. TC-KANRecon model aims to accelerate the MRI reconstruction process through deep learning methods while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed images. The MF-UKAN module can effectively balance the tradeoff between image denoising and structure preservation. Specifically, it presents the multi-head attention mechanisms and scalar modulation factors, which significantly enhances the model's robustness and structure preservation capabilities in complex noise environments. Moreover, the dynamic clipping strategy in TC-KANRecon adjusts the cropping interval according to the sampling steps, thereby mitigating image detail loss typically caused by traditional cropping methods and enriching the visual features of the images. Furthermore, the MC-Model module incorporates full-sampling k-space information, realizing efficient fusion of conditional information, enhancing the model's ability to process complex data, and improving the realism and detail richness of reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other MRI reconstruction methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, TC-KANRecon method exhibits excellent reconstruction results when processing high-noise, low-sampling-rate MRI data.

<p>Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in many different settings has provided various solutions and strategies for networking paradigms. Therefore, it reduces the complexity of the developments for the existing problems, which otherwise require more sophisticated approaches. One of those existing problems is the unknown user locations in an infrastructure-less environment in which users cannot connect to any communication device or computation-providing server, which is essential to task offloading in order to achieve the required quality of service (QoS). Therefore, in this study, we investigate this problem thoroughly and propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheme, DeepAir. DeepAir considers all of the necessary steps including sensing, localization, resource allocation, and multi-access edge computing (MEC) to achieve QoS requirements for the offloaded tasks without violating the maximum tolerable delay. To this end, we use two types of UAVs including detector UAVs, and serving UAVs. We utilize detector UAVs as DRL agents which ensure sensing, localization, and resource allocation. On the other hand, we utilize serving UAVs to provide MEC features. Our experiments show that DeepAir provides a high task success rate by deploying fewer detector UAVs in the environment, which includes different numbers of users and user attraction points, compared to benchmark methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hongchao Zhou, Shunbo Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel deformable convolutional pyramid network for unsupervised image registration. Specifically, the proposed network enhances the traditional pyramid network by adding an additional shared auxiliary decoder for image pairs. This decoder provides multi-scale high-level feature information from unblended image pairs for the registration task. During the registration process, we also design a multi-scale feature fusion block to extract the most beneficial features for the registration task from both global and local contexts. Validation results indicate that this method can capture complex deformations while achieving higher registration accuracy and maintaining smooth and plausible deformations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianping Zhou, Junhao Li, Guanjie Zheng, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

<p>Abstract: Deep learning has brought significant improvements to the field of cross-modal representation learning. For tasks such as text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and automatic speech recognition (ASR), a cross-modal fine-grained (frame-level) sequence representation is desired, emphasizing the semantic content of the text modality while de-emphasizing the paralinguistic information of the speech modality. We propose a method called "Vector Quantized Contrastive Token-Acoustic Pre-training (VQ-CTAP)", which uses the cross-modal aligned sequence transcoder to bring text and speech into a joint multimodal space, learning how to connect text and speech at the frame level. The proposed VQ-CTAP is a paradigm for cross-modal sequence representation learning, offering a promising solution for fine-grained generation and recognition tasks in speech processing. The VQ-CTAP can be directly applied to VC and ASR tasks without fine-tuning or additional structures. We propose a sequence-aware semantic connector, which connects multiple frozen pre-trained modules for the TTS task, exhibiting a plug-and-play capability. We design a stepping optimization strategy to ensure effective model convergence by gradually injecting and adjusting the influence of various loss components. Furthermore, we propose a semantic-transfer-wise paralinguistic consistency loss to enhance representational capabilities, allowing the model to better generalize to unseen data and capture the nuances of paralinguistic information. In addition, VQ-CTAP achieves high-compression speech coding at a rate of 25Hz from 24kHz input waveforms, which is a 960-fold reduction in the sampling rate.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qing Li, Chenyang Lyu, Jiahui Geng, Derui Zhu, Maxim Panov, Fakhri Karray</p>
<p>Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years. While LVLMs exhibit excellent ability in language understanding, question answering, and conversations of visual inputs, they are prone to producing hallucinations. While several methods are proposed to evaluate the hallucinations in LVLMs, most are reference-based and depend on external tools, which complicates their practical application. To assess the viability of alternative methods, it is critical to understand whether the reference-free approaches, which do not rely on any external tools, can efficiently detect hallucinations. Therefore, we initiate an exploratory study to demonstrate the effectiveness of different reference-free solutions in detecting hallucinations in LVLMs. In particular, we conduct an extensive study on three kinds of techniques: uncertainty-based, consistency-based, and supervised uncertainty quantification methods on four representative LVLMs across two different tasks. The empirical results show that the reference-free approaches are capable of effectively detecting non-factual responses in LVLMs, with the supervised uncertainty quantification method outperforming the others, achieving the best performance across different settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) aims to identify the pairs of humans and objects in images and to recognize their relationships, ultimately forming $\langle human, object, verb \rangle$ triplets. Under default settings, HOI performance is nearly saturated, with many studies focusing on long-tail distribution and zero-shot/few-shot scenarios. Let us consider an intriguing problem:``What if there is only test dataset without training dataset, using multimodal visual foundation model in a training-free manner? '' This study uses two experimental settings: grounding truth and random arbitrary combinations. We get some interesting conclusion and find that the open vocabulary capabilities of the multimodal visual foundation model are not yet fully realized. Additionally, replacing the feature extraction with grounding DINO further confirms these findings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Optical remote sensing and Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) remote sensing are crucial for earth observation, offering complementary capabilities. While optical sensors provide high-quality images, they are limited by weather and lighting conditions. In contrast, SAR sensors can operate effectively under adverse conditions. This letter proposes a GAN-based SAR-to-optical image translation method named Seg-CycleGAN, designed to enhance the accuracy of ship target translation by leveraging semantic information from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model. Our method utilizes the downstream task of ship target semantic segmentation to guide the training of image translation network, improving the quality of output Optical-styled images. The potential of foundation-model-annotated datasets in SAR-to-optical translation tasks is revealed. This work suggests broader research and applications for downstream-task-guided frameworks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Boyang Sun, Ignavier Ng, Guangyi Chen, Yifan Shen, Qirong Ho, Kun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Identifying the causal relations between interested variables plays a pivotal role in representation learning as it provides deep insights into the dataset. Identifiability, as the central theme of this approach, normally hinges on leveraging data from multiple distributions (intervention, distribution shift, time series, etc.). Despite the exciting development in this field, a practical but often overlooked problem is: what if those distribution shifts happen sequentially? In contrast, any intelligence possesses the capacity to abstract and refine learned knowledge sequentially -- lifelong learning. In this paper, with a particular focus on the nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) framework, we move one step forward toward the question of enabling models to learn meaningful (identifiable) representations in a sequential manner, termed continual causal representation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that model identifiability progresses from a subspace level to a component-wise level as the number of distributions increases. Empirically, we show that our method achieves performance comparable to nonlinear ICA methods trained jointly on multiple offline distributions and, surprisingly, the incoming new distribution does not necessarily benefit the identification of all latent variables.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elisa Tosello, Alessandro Valentini, Andrea Micheli</p>
<p>Abstract: Task And Motion Planning (TAMP) is the problem of finding a solution to an automated planning problem that includes discrete actions executable by low-level continuous motions. This field is gaining increasing interest within the robotics community, as it significantly enhances robot's autonomy in real-world applications. Many solutions and formulations exist, but no clear standard representation has emerged. In this paper, we propose a general and open-source framework for modeling and benchmarking TAMP problems. Moreover, we introduce an innovative meta-technique to solve TAMP problems involving moving agents and multiple task-state-dependent obstacles. This approach enables using any off-the-shelf task planner and motion planner while leveraging a geometric analysis of the motion planner's search space to prune the task planner's exploration, enhancing its efficiency. We also show how to specialize this meta-engine for the case of an incremental SMT-based planner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across benchmark problems of increasing complexity, where robots must navigate environments with movable obstacles. Finally, we integrate state-of-the-art TAMP algorithms into our framework and compare their performance with our achievements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoze Wang, Ronald W. Di Tullio, Spencer Rooke, Vijay Balasubramanian</p>
<p>Abstract: The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Grace Liu, Michael Tang, Benjamin Eysenbach</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present empirical evidence of skills and directed exploration emerging from a simple RL algorithm long before any successful trials are observed. For example, in a manipulation task, the agent is given a single observation of the goal state and learns skills, first for moving its end-effector, then for pushing the block, and finally for picking up and placing the block. These skills emerge before the agent has ever successfully placed the block at the goal location and without the aid of any reward functions, demonstrations, or manually-specified distance metrics. Once the agent has learned to reach the goal state reliably, exploration is reduced. Implementing our method involves a simple modification of prior work and does not require density estimates, ensembles, or any additional hyperparameters. Intuitively, the proposed method seems like it should be terrible at exploration, and we lack a clear theoretical understanding of why it works so effectively, though our experiments provide some hints.</p>

<p>Abstract: In multi-label classification, machine learning encounters the challenge of domain generalization when handling tasks with distributions differing from the training data. Existing approaches primarily focus on vision object recognition and neglect the integration of natural language. Recent advancements in vision-language pre-training leverage supervision from extensive visual-language pairs, enabling learning across diverse domains and enhancing recognition in multi-modal scenarios. However, these approaches face limitations in loss function utilization, generality across backbones, and class-aware visual fusion. This paper proposes solutions to these limitations by inferring the actual loss, broadening evaluations to larger vision-language backbones, and introducing Mixup-CLIPood, which incorporates a novel mix-up loss for enhanced class-aware visual fusion. Our method demonstrates superior performance in domain generalization across multiple datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eli Sennesh, Hao Wu, Tommaso Salvatori</p>
<p>Abstract: Unexpected stimuli induce "error" or "surprise" signals in the brain. The theory of predictive coding promises to explain these observations in terms of Bayesian inference by suggesting that the cortex implements variational inference in a probabilistic graphical model. However, when applied to machine learning tasks, this family of algorithms has yet to perform on par with other variational approaches in high-dimensional, structured inference problems. To address this, we introduce a novel predictive coding algorithm for structured generative models, that we call divide-and-conquer predictive coding (DCPC). DCPC differs from other formulations of predictive coding, as it respects the correlation structure of the generative model and provably performs maximum-likelihood updates of model parameters, all without sacrificing biological plausibility. Empirically, DCPC achieves better numerical performance than competing algorithms and provides accurate inference in a number of problems not previously addressed with predictive coding. We provide an open implementation of DCPC in Pyro on Github.</p>

<p>Abstract: Drowsiness detection is essential for improving safety in areas such as transportation and workplace health. This study presents a real-time system designed to detect drowsiness using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and facial landmark detection techniques. The system leverages Dlibs pre-trained shape predictor model to accurately detect and monitor 68 facial landmarks, which are used to compute the EAR. By establishing a threshold for the EAR, the system identifies when eyes are closed, indicating potential drowsiness. The process involves capturing a live video stream, detecting faces in each frame, extracting eye landmarks, and calculating the EAR to assess alertness. Our experiments show that the system reliably detects drowsiness with high accuracy while maintaining low computational demands. This study offers a strong solution for real-time drowsiness detection, with promising applications in driver monitoring and workplace safety. Future research will investigate incorporating additional physiological and contextual data to further enhance detection accuracy and reliability.</p>

<p>Abstract: Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories. Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chih-Wei Song, Yu-Kai Lee, Yin-Te Tsai</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models in recent years, there has been an increasing demand for domain-specific Agents that can cater to the unique needs of enterprises and organizations. Unlike general models, which strive for broad coverage, these specialized Agents rely on focused datasets tailored to their intended applications. This research proposes a pipeline that leverages the power of LLMs and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation related framework to construct high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning on specific domains using custom document collections. By ingesting domain-specific documents, the pipeline generates relevant and contextually appropriate instructions, thus effectively creating a comprehensive dataset for fine-tuning LLMs on the target domain. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional dataset creation methods, which often rely on manual curation or web-scraping techniques that may introduce noise and irrelevant data. Notably, our pipeline offers a dynamic solution that can quickly adapt to updates or modifications in the domain-specific document collection, eliminating the need for complete retraining. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of data scarcity by enabling the generation of instruction datasets from a limited set of initial documents, rendering it suitable for unpopular or specialized domains where comprehensive datasets are scarce. As a case study, we apply this approach to the domain of psychiatry, a field requiring specialized knowledge and sensitive handling of patient information. The resulting fine-tuned LLM demonstrates showcases the viability of the proposed approach and underscores its potential for widespread adoption across various industries and domains where tailored, accurate, and contextually relevant language models are indispensable.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Min Woo Cho, Seok Hyeon Hwang, Jun-Young Jang, Jin Yeong Song, Sun-kwang Hwang, Kyoung Je Cha, Dong Yong Park, Kyungjun Song, Sang Min Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Ventilated acoustic resonator(VAR), a type of acoustic metamaterial, emerge as an alternative for sound attenuation in environments that require ventilation, owing to its excellent low-frequency attenuation performance and flexible shape adaptability. However, due to the non-linear acoustic responses of VARs, the VAR designs are generally obtained within a limited parametrized design space, and the design relies on the iteration of the numerical simulation which consumes a considerable amount of computational time and resources. This paper proposes an acoustic response-encoded variational autoencoder (AR-VAE), a novel variational autoencoder-based generative design model for the efficient and accurate inverse design of VAR even with non-parametrized designs. The AR-VAE matches the high-dimensional acoustic response with the VAR cross-section image in the dimension-reduced latent space, which enables the AR-VAE to generate various non-parametrized VAR cross-section images with the target acoustic response. AR-VAE generates non-parameterized VARs from target acoustic responses, which show a 25-fold reduction in mean squared error compared to conventional deep learning-based parameter searching methods while exhibiting lower average mean squared error and peak frequency variance. By combining the inverse-designed VARs by AR-VAE, multi-cavity VAR was devised for broadband and multitarget peak frequency attenuation. The proposed design method presents a new approach for structural inverse-design with a high-dimensional non-linear physical response.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Foutter, Praneet Bhoj, Rohan Sinha, Amine Elhafsi, Somrita Banerjee, Christopher Agia, Justin Kruger, Tommaso Guffanti, Daniele Gammelli, Simone D'Amico, Marco Pavone</p>
<p>Abstract: Foundation models, e.g., large language models, possess attributes of intelligence which offer promise to endow a robot with the contextual understanding necessary to navigate complex, unstructured tasks in the wild. In the future of space robotics, we see three core challenges which motivate the use of a foundation model adapted to space-based applications: 1) Scalability of ground-in-the-loop operations; 2) Generalizing prior knowledge to novel environments; and 3) Multi-modality in tasks and sensor data. Therefore, as a first-step towards building a foundation model for space-based applications, we automatically label the AI4Mars dataset to curate a language annotated dataset of visual-question-answer tuples. We fine-tune a pretrained LLaVA checkpoint on this dataset to endow a vision-language model with the ability to perform spatial reasoning and navigation on Mars' surface. In this work, we demonstrate that 1) existing vision-language models are deficient visual reasoners in space-based applications, and 2) fine-tuning a vision-language model on extraterrestrial data significantly improves the quality of responses even with a limited training dataset of only a few thousand samples.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Liu, Zejun Kang, Xing Han</p>
<p>Abstract: With the growing demand for offline PDF chatbots in automotive industrial production environments, optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in local, low-performance settings has become increasingly important. This study focuses on enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for processing complex automotive industry documents using locally deployed Ollama models. Based on the Langchain framework, we propose a multi-dimensional optimization approach for Ollama's local RAG implementation. Our method addresses key challenges in automotive document processing, including multi-column layouts and technical specifications. We introduce improvements in PDF processing, retrieval mechanisms, and context compression, tailored to the unique characteristics of automotive industry documents. Additionally, we design custom classes supporting embedding pipelines and an agent supporting self-RAG based on LangGraph best practices. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a proprietary dataset comprising typical automotive industry documents, including technical reports and corporate regulations. We compared our optimized RAG model and self-RAG agent against a naive RAG baseline across three datasets: our automotive industry dataset, QReCC, and CoQA. Results demonstrate significant improvements in context precision, context recall, answer relevancy, and faithfulness, with particularly notable performance on the automotive industry dataset. Our optimization scheme provides an effective solution for deploying local RAG systems in the automotive sector, addressing the specific needs of PDF chatbots in industrial production environments. This research has important implications for advancing information processing and intelligent production in the automotive industry.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eunsoo Im, Changhyun Jee, Jung Kwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Person detection and tracking (PDT) has seen significant advancements with 2D camera-based systems in the autonomous vehicle field, leading to widespread adoption of these algorithms. However, growing privacy concerns have recently emerged as a major issue, prompting a shift towards LiDAR-based PDT as a viable alternative. Within this domain, "Tracking-by-Detection" (TBD) has become a prominent methodology. Despite its effectiveness, LiDAR-based PDT has not yet achieved the same level of performance as camera-based PDT. This paper examines key components of the LiDAR-based PDT framework, including detection post-processing, data association, motion modeling, and lifecycle management. Building upon these insights, we introduce SpbTrack, a robust person tracker designed for diverse environments. Our method achieves superior performance on noisy datasets and state-of-the-art results on KITTI Dataset benchmarks and custom office indoor dataset among LiDAR-based trackers.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jehyun Lee, Peiyuan Lim, Bryan Hooi, Dinil Mon Divakaran</p>
<p>Abstract: To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms. Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention. However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected. Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance.
  In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages. Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack. We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain. We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset. Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions. Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anik Chattopadhyay, Arunava Banerjee</p>
<p>Abstract: Sensory stimuli in animals are encoded into spike trains by neurons, offering advantages such as sparsity, energy efficiency, and high temporal resolution. This paper presents a signal processing framework that deterministically encodes continuous-time signals into biologically feasible spike trains, and addresses the questions about representable signal classes and reconstruction bounds. The framework considers encoding of a signal through spike trains generated by an ensemble of neurons using a convolve-then-threshold mechanism with various convolution kernels. A closed-form solution to the inverse problem, from spike trains to signal reconstruction, is derived in the Hilbert space of shifted kernel functions, ensuring sparse representation of a generalized Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) class of signals. Additionally, inspired by real-time processing in biological systems, an efficient iterative version of the optimal reconstruction is formulated that considers only a finite window of past spikes, ensuring robustness of the technique to ill-conditioned encoding; convergence guarantees of the windowed reconstruction to the optimal solution are then provided. Experiments on a large audio dataset demonstrate excellent reconstruction accuracy at spike rates as low as one-fifth of the Nyquist rate, while showing clear competitive advantage in comparison to state-of-the-art sparse coding techniques in the low spike rate regime.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhichao Liao, Di Huang, Heming Fang, Yue Ma, Fengyuan Piao, Xinghui Li, Long Zeng, Pingfa Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Drawing freehand sketches of mechanical components on multimedia devices for AI-based engineering modeling has become a new trend. However, its development is being impeded because existing works cannot produce suitable sketches for data-driven research. These works either generate sketches lacking a freehand style or utilize generative models not originally designed for this task resulting in poor effectiveness. To address this issue, we design a two-stage generative framework mimicking the human sketching behavior pattern, called MSFormer, which is the first time to produce humanoid freehand sketches tailored for mechanical components. The first stage employs Open CASCADE technology to obtain multi-view contour sketches from mechanical components, filtering perturbing signals for the ensuing generation process. Meanwhile, we design a view selector to simulate viewpoint selection tasks during human sketching for picking out information-rich sketches. The second stage translates contour sketches into freehand sketches by a transformer-based generator. To retain essential modeling features as much as possible and rationalize stroke distribution, we introduce a novel edge-constraint stroke initialization. Furthermore, we utilize a CLIP vision encoder and a new loss function incorporating the Hausdorff distance to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for generating freehand sketches in the mechanical domain. Project page: https://mcfreeskegen.github.io .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Steve Yuwono, Dorothea Schwung, Andreas Schwung</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel transfer learning approach in state-based potential games (TL-SbPGs) for enhancing distributed self-optimization in manufacturing systems. The approach focuses on the practical relevant industrial setting where sharing and transferring gained knowledge among similar-behaved players improves the self-learning mechanism in large-scale systems. With TL-SbPGs, the gained knowledge can be reused by other players to optimize their policies, thereby improving the learning outcomes of the players and accelerating the learning process. To accomplish this goal, we develop transfer learning concepts and similarity criteria for players, which offer two distinct settings: (a) predefined similarities between players and (b) dynamically inferred similarities between players during training. We formally prove the applicability of the SbPG framework in transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method to determine the optimal timing and weighting of the transfer learning procedure during the training phase. Through experiments on a laboratory-scale testbed, we demonstrate that TL-SbPGs significantly boost production efficiency while reducing power consumption of the production schedules while also outperforming native SbPGs.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to their application in many challenging scientific visualization tasks. While advanced DNNs offer impressive generalization capabilities, understanding factors such as model prediction quality, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights can enable domain scientists to make informed decisions about their data. However, DNNs inherently lack ability to estimate prediction uncertainty, necessitating new research to construct robust uncertainty-aware visualization techniques tailored for various visualization tasks. In this work, we propose uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model scalar field data sets effectively and comprehensively study the efficacy and benefits of estimated uncertainty information for volume visualization tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDropout). These techniques enable uncertainty-informed volume visualization in scalar field data sets. Our extensive exploration across multiple data sets demonstrates that uncertainty-aware models produce informative volume visualization results. Moreover, integrating prediction uncertainty enhances the trustworthiness of our DNN model, making it suitable for robustly analyzing and visualizing real-world scientific volumetric data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mathias Rose Bjare, Stefan Lattner, Gerhard Widmer</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the quality and public interest in music generation systems have grown, encouraging research into various ways to control these systems. We propose a novel method for controlling surprisal in music generation using sequence models. To achieve this goal, we define a metric called Instantaneous Information Content (IIC). The IIC serves as a proxy function for the perceived musical surprisal (as estimated from a probabilistic model) and can be calculated at any point within a music piece. This enables the comparison of surprisal across different musical content even if the musical events occur in irregular time intervals. We use beam search to generate musical material whose IIC curve closely approximates a given target IIC. We experimentally show that the IIC correlates with harmonic and rhythmic complexity and note density. The correlation decreases with the length of the musical context used for estimating the IIC. Finally, we conduct a qualitative user study to test if human listeners can identify the IIC curves that have been used as targets when generating the respective musical material. We provide code for creating IIC interpolations and IIC visualizations on https://github.com/muthissar/iic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jasper van Beers, Coen de Visser</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and validity of data-driven quadrotor model predictions is essential for their accepted and practical use. This is especially true for grey- and black-box models wherein the mapping of inputs to predictions is not transparent and subsequent reliability notoriously difficult to ascertain. Nonetheless, such techniques are frequently and successfully used to identify quadrotor models. Prediction intervals (PIs) may be employed to provide insight into the consistency and accuracy of model predictions. This paper estimates such PIs for polynomial and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) quadrotor aerodynamic models. Two existing ANN PI estimation techniques - the bootstrap method and the quality driven method - are validated numerically for quadrotor aerodynamic models using an existing high-fidelity quadrotor simulation. Quadrotor aerodynamic models are then identified on real quadrotor flight data to demonstrate their utility and explore their sensitivity to model interpolation and extrapolation. It is found that the ANN-based PIs widen considerably when extrapolating and remain constant, or shrink, when interpolating. While this behaviour also occurs for the polynomial PIs, it is of lower magnitude. The estimated PIs establish probabilistic bounds within which the quadrotor model outputs will likely lie, subject to modelling and measurement uncertainties that are reflected through the PI widths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fangyuan Zhao, Yuexiang Xie, Xuebin Ren, Bolin Ding, Shusen Yang, Yaliang Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) becomes vulnerable to Byzantine attacks where some of participators tend to damage the utility or discourage the convergence of the learned model via sending their malicious model updates. Previous works propose to apply robust rules to aggregate updates from participators against different types of Byzantine attacks, while at the same time, attackers can further design advanced Byzantine attack algorithms targeting specific aggregation rule when it is known. In practice, FL systems can involve a black-box server that makes the adopted aggregation rule inaccessible to participants, which can naturally defend or weaken some Byzantine attacks. In this paper, we provide an in-depth understanding on the Byzantine robustness of the FL system with a black-box server. Our investigation demonstrates the improved Byzantine robustness of a black-box server employing a dynamic defense strategy. We provide both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis to reveal that the black-box server can mitigate the worst-case attack impact from a maximum level to an expectation level, which is attributed to the inherent inaccessibility and randomness offered by a black-box server.The source code is available at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/Byzantine_attack_defense to promote further research in the community.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research on hate speech has predominantly revolved around detection and interpretation from textual inputs, leaving verbal content largely unexplored. While there has been limited exploration into hate speech detection within verbal acoustic speech inputs, the aspect of interpretability has been overlooked. Therefore, we introduce a new task of explainable audio hate speech detection. Specifically, we aim to identify the precise time intervals, referred to as audio frame-level rationales, which serve as evidence for hate speech classification. Towards this end, we propose two different approaches: cascading and End-to-End (E2E). The cascading approach initially converts audio to transcripts, identifies hate speech within these transcripts, and subsequently locates the corresponding audio time frames. Conversely, the E2E approach processes audio utterances directly, which allows it to pinpoint hate speech within specific time frames. Additionally, due to the lack of explainable audio hate speech datasets that include audio frame-level rationales, we curated a synthetic audio dataset to train our models. We further validated these models on actual human speech utterances and found that the E2E approach outperforms the cascading method in terms of the audio frame Intersection over Union (IoU) metric. Furthermore, we observed that including frame-level rationales significantly enhances hate speech detection accuracy for the E2E approach.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jian Xu, Zhiqi Lin, Min Chen, Junmei Yang, Delu Zeng, John Paisley</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional deep Gaussian processes model the data evolution using a discrete hierarchy, whereas differential Gaussian processes (DIFFGPs) represent the evolution as an infinitely deep Gaussian process. However, prior DIFFGP methods often overlook the uncertainty of kernel hyperparameters and assume them to be fixed and time-invariant, failing to leverage the unique synergy between continuous-time models and approximate inference. In this work, we propose a fully Bayesian approach that treats the kernel hyperparameters as random variables and constructs coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to learn their posterior distribution and that of inducing points. By incorporating estimation uncertainty on hyperparameters, our method enhances the model's flexibility and adaptability to complex dynamics. Additionally, our approach provides a time-varying, comprehensive, and realistic posterior approximation through coupling variables using SDE methods. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our method over traditional approaches, showcasing its superior performance in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and other metrics. Our work opens up exciting research avenues for advancing Bayesian inference and offers a powerful modeling tool for continuous-time Gaussian processes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yu Zhang, Haoxiang Liu, Feijun Jiang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for decision making problems leveraging the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Traditional methods such as expert systems, planning algorithms, and reinforcement learning often exhibit limited generalization, typically requiring the training of new models for each unique task. In contrast, LLMs demonstrate remarkable success in generalizing across varied language tasks, inspiring a new strategy for training decision making models. Our approach, referred to as "Learning then Using" (LTU), entails a two-stage process. Initially, the \textit{learning} phase develops a robust foundational decision making model by integrating diverse knowledge from various domains and decision making contexts. The subsequent \textit{using} phase refines this foundation model for specific decision making scenarios. Distinct from other studies that employ LLMs for decision making through supervised learning, our LTU method embraces a versatile training methodology that combines broad pre-training with targeted fine-tuning. Experiments in e-commerce domains such as advertising and search optimization have shown that LTU approach outperforms traditional supervised learning regimes in decision making capabilities and generalization. The LTU approach is the first practical training architecture for both single-step and multi-step decision making tasks combined with LLMs, which can be applied beyond game and robot domains. It provides a robust and adaptable framework for decision making, enhances the effectiveness and flexibility of various systems in tackling various challenges.</p>

We then use this new dataset to extend the generalization experiments conducted by DeepMind on MGNs by testing how well an MGN can generalize to different shapes. In our numerical tests, we show that MGNs can sometimes generalize well to various shapes by training on a dataset of one obstacle shape and testing on a dataset of another obstacle shape.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural enhancement through super-resolution deep neural networks opens up new possibilities for ultra-high-definition live streaming over existing encoding and networking infrastructure. Yet, the heavy SR DNN inference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the overhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on selected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight reusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained and fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the first neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level scheduling. In the presented solutions, two novel techniques are incorporated to make good scheduling decisions for inference overhead optimization and reduce the scheduling latency. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical analysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight yet accurate quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set. Secondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves parallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation process into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation. The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling latency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement. When compared to the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir reduces the energy overhead of SR-integrated mobile clients by 38.1% at most (and 22.4% on average) and the monetary costs of cloud-based SR by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiaoxin Li, Dong Liang, Yinsheng Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used to obtain quantitative elemental composition of imaged subjects for personalized and precise medical diagnosis. Compared with existing high-end DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequentially-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially-scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material decomposition approaches for DECT assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification accuracy of iodine concentration. In this work, we developed a technique to achieve sequentially-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and temporal extrapolation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams. Results demonstrated the improvement of iodine quantification accuracy using ACCELERATION.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dang Huu-Tien, Trung-Tin Pham, Hoang Thanh-Tung, Naoya Inoue</p>
<p>Abstract: Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning. Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yorick Sens, Henriette Knopp, Sven Peldszus, Thorsten Berger</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of machine learning (ML) and its embedding in systems has drastically changed the engineering of software-intensive systems. Traditionally, software engineering focuses on manually created artifacts such as source code and the process of creating them, as well as best practices for integrating them, i.e., software architectures. In contrast, the development of ML artifacts, i.e. ML models, comes from data science and focuses on the ML models and their training data. However, to deliver value to end users, these ML models must be embedded in traditional software, often forming complex topologies. In fact, ML-enabled software can easily incorporate many different ML models. While the challenges and practices of building ML-enabled systems have been studied to some extent, beyond isolated examples, little is known about the characteristics of real-world ML-enabled systems. Properly embedding ML models in systems so that they can be easily maintained or reused is far from trivial. We need to improve our empirical understanding of such systems, which we address by presenting the first large-scale study of real ML-enabled software systems, covering over 2,928 open source systems on GitHub. We classified and analyzed them to determine their characteristics, as well as their practices for reusing ML models and related code, and the architecture of these systems. Our findings provide practitioners and researchers with insight into practices for embedding and integrating ML models, bringing data science and software engineering closer together.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abraham Nash</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN) is a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions. It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as a prerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on health data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training in healthcare, allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial healthcare algorithms. Patients receive rewards into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to funding decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage. It highlights the potential to transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Manuel Milling, Shuo Liu, Andreas Triantafyllopoulos, Ilhan Aslan, Bj\"orn W. Schuller</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural network models for audio tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and acoustic scene classification (ASC), are susceptible to noise contamination for real-life applications. To improve audio quality, an enhancement module, which can be developed independently, is explicitly used at the front-end of the target audio applications. In this paper, we present an end-to-end learning solution to jointly optimise the models for audio enhancement (AE) and the subsequent applications. To guide the optimisation of the AE module towards a target application, and especially to overcome difficult samples, we make use of the sample-wise performance measure as an indication of sample importance. In experiments, we consider four representative applications to evaluate our training paradigm, i.e., ASR, speech command recognition (SCR), speech emotion recognition (SER), and ASC. These applications are associated with speech and non-speech tasks concerning semantic and non-semantic features, transient and global information, and the experimental results indicate that our proposed approach can considerably boost the noise robustness of the models, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), for a wide range of computer audition tasks in everyday-life noisy environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Karel D'Oosterlinck, Winnie Xu, Chris Develder, Thomas Demeester, Amanpreet Singh, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela, Shikib Mehri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often aligned using contrastive alignment objectives and preference pair datasets. The interaction between model, paired data, and objective makes alignment a complicated procedure, sometimes producing subpar results. We study this and find that (i) preference data gives a better learning signal when the underlying responses are contrastive, and (ii) alignment objectives lead to better performance when they specify more control over the model during training. Based on these insights, we introduce Contrastive Learning from AI Revisions (CLAIR), a data-creation method which leads to more contrastive preference pairs, and Anchored Preference Optimization (APO), a controllable and more stable alignment objective. We align Llama-3-8B-Instruct using various comparable datasets and alignment objectives and measure MixEval-Hard scores, which correlate highly with human judgments. The CLAIR preferences lead to the strongest performance out of all datasets, and APO consistently outperforms less controllable objectives. Our best model, trained on 32K CLAIR preferences with APO, improves Llama-3-8B-Instruct by 7.65%, closing the gap with GPT4-turbo by 45%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rohit Saxena, Frank Keller</p>
<p>Abstract: Movie screenplay summarization is challenging, as it requires an understanding of long input contexts and various elements unique to movies. Large language models have shown significant advancements in document summarization, but they often struggle with processing long input contexts. Furthermore, while television transcripts have received attention in recent studies, movie screenplay summarization remains underexplored. To stimulate research in this area, we present a new dataset, MovieSum, for abstractive summarization of movie screenplays. This dataset comprises 2200 movie screenplays accompanied by their Wikipedia plot summaries. We manually formatted the movie screenplays to represent their structural elements. Compared to existing datasets, MovieSum possesses several distinctive features: (1) It includes movie screenplays, which are longer than scripts of TV episodes. (2) It is twice the size of previous movie screenplay datasets. (3) It provides metadata with IMDb IDs to facilitate access to additional external knowledge. We also show the results of recently released large language models applied to summarization on our dataset to provide a detailed baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) enhance patient-physician communication, improve healthcare accessibility, and reduce costs. However, acquiring suitable data to train these systems poses significant challenges. Privacy concerns prevent the use of real conversations, necessitating synthetic alternatives. Synthetic dialogue generation from publicly available clinical notes offers a promising solution to this issue, providing realistic data while safeguarding privacy. Our approach, SynDial, uses a single LLM iteratively with zero-shot prompting and a feedback loop to generate and refine high-quality synthetic dialogues. The feedback consists of weighted evaluation scores for similarity and extractiveness. The iterative process ensures dialogues meet predefined thresholds, achieving superior extractiveness as a result of the feedback loop. Additionally, evaluation shows that the generated dialogues excel in factuality metric compared to the baselines and has comparable diversity scores with GPT4.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Carmelo Sferrazza, Dun-Ming Huang, Fangchen Liu, Jongmin Lee, Pieter Abbeel</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for machine learning algorithms applied to natural language processing and computer vision. Despite notable evidence of successful deployment of this architecture in the context of robot learning, we claim that vanilla transformers do not fully exploit the structure of the robot learning problem. Therefore, we propose Body Transformer (BoT), an architecture that leverages the robot embodiment by providing an inductive bias that guides the learning process. We represent the robot body as a graph of sensors and actuators, and rely on masked attention to pool information throughout the architecture. The resulting architecture outperforms the vanilla transformer, as well as the classical multilayer perceptron, in terms of task completion, scaling properties, and computational efficiency when representing either imitation or reinforcement learning policies.

<p>Abstract: This paper explores humor detection through a linguistic lens, prioritizing syntactic, semantic, and contextual features over computational methods in Natural Language Processing. We categorize features into syntactic, semantic, and contextual dimensions, including lexicons, structural statistics, Word2Vec, WordNet, and phonetic style. Our proposed model, Colbert, utilizes BERT embeddings and parallel hidden layers to capture sentence congruity. By combining syntactic, semantic, and contextual features, we train Colbert for humor detection. Feature engineering examines essential syntactic and semantic features alongside BERT embeddings. SHAP interpretations and decision trees identify influential features, revealing that a holistic approach improves humor detection accuracy on unseen data. Integrating linguistic cues from different dimensions enhances the model's ability to understand humor complexity beyond traditional computational methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Theo Adrai, Guy Ohayon, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad</p>
<p>Abstract: We propose an image restoration algorithm that can control the perceptual quality and/or the mean square error (MSE) of any pre-trained model, trading one over the other at test time. Our algorithm is few-shot: Given about a dozen images restored by the model, it can significantly improve the perceptual quality and/or the MSE of the model for newly restored images without further training. Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that links between the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes the MSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has been shown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output of the former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, to improve the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained to minimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformation in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute in closed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, we find that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained to achieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual quality even further. And by interpolating the results with the original output of the model, we can improve their MSE on the expense of perceptual quality. We illustrate our method on a variety of degradations applied to general content images of arbitrary dimensions.</p>

<p>Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increased focus on early detection, prevention, and prediction of diseases. This, together with advances in sensor technology and the Internet of Things, has led to accelerated efforts in the development of personal health monitoring systems. This study analyses the state of the art in the use of Semantic Web technologies in sensor-based personal health monitoring systems. Using a systematic approach, a total of 43 systems are selected as representative of the current state of the art. We critically analyse the extent to which the selected systems address seven key challenges: interoperability, context awareness, situation detection, situation prediction, decision support, explainability, and uncertainty handling. We discuss the role and limitations of Semantic Web technologies in managing each challenge. We then conduct a quality assessment of the selected systems based on the data and devices used, system and components development, rigour of evaluation, and accessibility of research outputs. Finally, we propose a reference architecture to provide guidance for the design and development of new systems. This study provides a comprehensive mapping of the field, identifies inadequacies in the state of the art, and provides recommendations for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: In the timeline-based approach to planning, the evolution over time of a set of state variables (the timelines) is governed by a set of temporal constraints. Traditional timeline-based planning systems excel at the integration of planning with execution by handling temporal uncertainty. In order to handle general nondeterminism as well, the concept of timeline-based games has been recently introduced. It has been proved that finding whether a winning strategy exists for such games is 2EXPTIME-complete. However, a concrete approach to synthesize controllers implementing such strategies is missing. This paper fills this gap, by providing an effective and computationally optimal approach to controller synthesis for timeline-based games.</p>

<p>Abstract: Counterfactuals answer questions of what would have been observed under altered circumstances and can therefore offer valuable insights. Whereas the classical interventional interpretation of counterfactuals has been studied extensively, backtracking constitutes a less studied alternative where all causal laws are kept intact. In the present work, we introduce a practical method called deep backtracking counterfactuals (DeepBC) for computing backtracking counterfactuals in structural causal models that consist of deep generative components. We propose two distinct versions of our method--one utilizing Langevin Monte Carlo sampling and the other employing constrained optimization--to generate counterfactuals for high-dimensional data. As a special case, our formulation reduces to methods in the field of counterfactual explanations. Compared to these, our approach represents a causally compliant, versatile and modular alternative. We demonstrate these properties experimentally on a modified version of MNIST and CelebA.</p>

<p>Abstract: Autonomous driving technology, a catalyst for revolutionizing transportation and urban mobility, has the tend to transition from rule-based systems to data-driven strategies. Traditional module-based systems are constrained by cumulative errors among cascaded modules and inflexible pre-set rules. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving systems have the potential to avoid error accumulation due to their fully data-driven training process, although they often lack transparency due to their "black box" nature, complicating the validation and traceability of decisions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated abilities including understanding context, logical reasoning, and generating answers. A natural thought is to utilize these abilities to empower autonomous driving. By combining LLM with foundation vision models, it could open the door to open-world understanding, reasoning, and few-shot learning, which current autonomous driving systems are lacking. In this paper, we systematically review a research line about \textit{Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving (LLM4AD)}. This study evaluates the current state of technological advancements, distinctly outlining the principal challenges and prospective directions for the field.

<p>Abstract: Although In-Context Learning (ICL) brings remarkable performance gains to Large Language Models (LLMs), the improvements remain lower than fine-tuning on downstream tasks. This paper introduces Multi-Modal In-Context Tuning (MMICT), a novel multi-modal fine-tuning paradigm that boosts multi-modal fine-tuning by fully leveraging the promising ICL capability of multi-modal LLMs (MM-LLMs). We propose the Multi-Modal Hub (M-Hub), a unified module that captures various multi-modal features according to different inputs and objectives. Based on M-Hub, MMICT enables MM-LLMs to learn from in-context visual-guided textual features and subsequently generate outputs conditioned on the textual-guided visual features. Moreover, leveraging the flexibility of M-Hub, we design a variety of in-context demonstrations. Extensive experiments on a diverse range of downstream multi-modal tasks demonstrate that MMICT significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning strategy and the vanilla ICT method that directly takes the concatenation of all information from different modalities as input.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Guan, Yifan Zhou, Denis Liu, Yantian Zha, Heni Ben Amor, Subbarao Kambhampati</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale generative models are shown to be useful for sampling meaningful candidate solutions, yet they often overlook task constraints and user preferences. Their full power is better harnessed when the models are coupled with external verifiers and the final solutions are derived iteratively or progressively according to the verification feedback. In the context of embodied AI, verification often solely involves assessing whether goal conditions specified in the instructions have been met. Nonetheless, for these agents to be seamlessly integrated into daily life, it is crucial to account for a broader range of constraints and preferences beyond bare task success (e.g., a robot should grasp bread with care to avoid significant deformations). However, given the unbounded scope of robot tasks, it is infeasible to construct scripted verifiers akin to those used for explicit-knowledge tasks like the game of Go and theorem proving. This begs the question: when no sound verifier is available, can we use large vision and language models (VLMs), which are approximately omniscient, as scalable Behavior Critics to catch undesirable robot behaviors in videos? To answer this, we first construct a benchmark that contains diverse cases of goal-reaching yet undesirable robot policies. Then, we comprehensively evaluate VLM critics to gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and failure modes. Based on the evaluation, we provide guidelines on how to effectively utilize VLM critiques and showcase a practical way to integrate the feedback into an iterative process of policy refinement. The dataset and codebase are released at: https://guansuns.github.io/pages/vlm-critic.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arun Kumar, Paul Schrater</p>
<p>Abstract: People aptly exhibit general intelligence behaviors in solving a variety of tasks with flexibility and ability to adapt to novel situations by reusing and applying high-level knowledge acquired over time. But artificial agents are more like specialists, lacking such generalist behaviors. Artificial agents will require understanding and exploiting critical structured knowledge representations. We present a metacognitive generalization framework, Knowledge-Interaction-eXecution (KIX), and argue that interactions with objects leveraging type space facilitate the learning of transferable interaction concepts and generalization. It is a natural way of integrating knowledge into reinforcement learning and is promising to act as an enabler for autonomous and generalist behaviors in artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Botao Yu, Frazier N. Baker, Ziqi Chen, Xia Ning, Huan Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Chemistry plays a crucial role in many domains, such as drug discovery and material science. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit remarkable capabilities on natural language processing tasks, existing research indicates that their performance on chemistry tasks is discouragingly low. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus by a substantial margin. To accomplish this, we propose SMolInstruct, a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality dataset for instruction tuning. It contains 14 selected chemistry tasks and over three million samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. Using SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks. Our analysis further demonstrates the critical role of the proposed dataset in driving the performance improvements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyang Song, Qincheng Lu, He Zhu, David Buckeridge, Yue Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Learning time-series representations for discriminative tasks, such as classification and regression, has been a long-standing challenge in the healthcare domain. Current pre-training methods are limited in either unidirectional next-token prediction or randomly masked token prediction. We propose a novel architecture called Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiTimelyGPT), which pre-trains on biosignals and longitudinal clinical records by both next-token and previous-token prediction in alternating transformer layers. This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignals and longitudinal clinical records, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from biosignal time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaohuan Zhan, Lisha Yu, Sijie Yu, Guang Tan</p>
<p>Abstract: In the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task, the agent is required to navigate to a destination following a natural language instruction. While learning-based approaches have been a major solution to the task, they suffer from high training costs and lack of interpretability. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for VLN due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing LLM-based methods face limitations in memory construction and diversity of navigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques. Firstly, we introduce a method to maintain a topological map that stores navigation history, retaining information about viewpoints, objects, and their spatial relationships. This map also serves as a global action space. Additionally, we present a Navigation Chain of Thoughts module, leveraging human navigation examples to enrich navigation strategy diversity. Finally, we establish a pipeline that integrates navigational memory and strategies with perception and action prediction modules. Experimental results on the REVERIE and R2R datasets show that our method effectively enhances the navigation ability of the LLM and improves the interpretability of navigation reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mayra Russo, Maria-Esther Vidal</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) systems are capable of reproducing and often amplifying undesired biases. This puts emphasis on the importance of operating under practices that enable the study and understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of ML pipelines, prompting the emergence of documentation frameworks with the idea that ``any remedy for bias starts with awareness of its existence''. However, a resource that can formally describe these pipelines in terms of biases detected is still amiss. To fill this gap, we present the Doc-BiasO ontology, a resource that aims to create an integrated vocabulary of biases defined in the \textit{fair-ML} literature and their measures, as well as to incorporate relevant terminology and the relationships between them. Overseeing ontology engineering best practices, we re-use existing vocabulary on machine learning and AI, to foster knowledge sharing and interoperability between the actors concerned with its research, development, regulation, among others. Overall, our main objective is to contribute towards clarifying existing terminology on bias research as it rapidly expands to all areas of AI and to improve the interpretation of bias in data and downstream impact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Language models have emerged as a critical area of focus in artificial intelligence, particularly with the introduction of groundbreaking innovations like ChatGPT. Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyuan Zhou, Huan Zhao, Yuheng Cheng, Yuji Cao, Gaoqi Liang, Guolong Liu, Wenxuan Liu, Yan Xu, Junhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: In response to the urgent demand for grid stability and the complex challenges posed by renewable energy integration and electricity market dynamics, the power sector increasingly seeks innovative technological solutions. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have become a key technology to improve efficiency and promote intelligent progress in the power sector with their excellent natural language processing, logical reasoning, and generalization capabilities. Despite their potential, the absence of a performance evaluation benchmark for LLM in the power sector has limited the effective application of these technologies. Addressing this gap, our study introduces "ElecBench", an evaluation benchmark of LLMs within the power sector. ElecBench aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing evaluation benchmarks by providing comprehensive coverage of sector-specific scenarios, deepening the testing of professional knowledge, and enhancing decision-making precision. The framework categorizes scenarios into general knowledge and professional business, further divided into six core performance metrics: factuality, logicality, stability, security, fairness, and expressiveness, and is subdivided into 24 sub-metrics, offering profound insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLM applications in the power sector. To ensure transparency, we have made the complete test set public, evaluating the performance of eight LLMs across various scenarios and metrics. ElecBench aspires to serve as the standard benchmark for LLM applications in the power sector, supporting continuous updates of scenarios, metrics, and models to drive technological progress and application.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunjie He, Daniel Hernandez, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Bo Xiong, Yuqicheng Zhu, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab</p>
<p>Abstract: Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance as general-purpose assistants, excelling across a variety of reasoning tasks. This achievement represents a significant step toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Despite these advancements, the effectiveness of LLMs often hinges on the specific prompting strategies employed, and there remains a lack of a robust framework to facilitate learning and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel learning framework, THOUGHT-LIKE-PRO In this framework, we utilize imitation learning to imitate the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process which is verified and translated from reasoning trajectories generated by a symbolic Prolog logic engine. This framework proceeds in a self-driven manner, that enables LLMs to formulate rules and statements from given instructions and leverage the symbolic Prolog engine to derive results. Subsequently, LLMs convert Prolog-derived successive reasoning trajectories into natural language CoT for imitation learning. Our empirical findings indicate that our proposed approach substantially enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs and demonstrates robust generalization across out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xi Victoria Lin, Akshat Shrivastava, Liang Luo, Srinivasan Iyer, Mike Lewis, Gargi Ghosh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Armen Aghajanyan</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce MoMa, a novel modality-aware mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture designed for pre-training mixed-modal, early-fusion language models. MoMa processes images and text in arbitrary sequences by dividing expert modules into modality-specific groups. These groups exclusively process designated tokens while employing learned routing within each group to maintain semantically informed adaptivity. Our empirical results reveal substantial pre-training efficiency gains through this modality-specific parameter allocation. Under a 1-trillion-token training budget, the MoMa 1.4B model, featuring 4 text experts and 4 image experts, achieves impressive FLOPs savings: 3.7x overall, with 2.6x for text and 5.2x for image processing compared to a compute-equivalent dense baseline, measured by pre-training loss. This outperforms the standard expert-choice MoE with 8 mixed-modal experts, which achieves 3x overall FLOPs savings (3x for text, 2.8x for image). Combining MoMa with mixture-of-depths (MoD) further improves pre-training FLOPs savings to 4.2x overall (text: 3.4x, image: 5.3x), although this combination hurts performance in causal inference due to increased sensitivity to router accuracy. These results demonstrate MoMa's potential to significantly advance the efficiency of mixed-modal, early-fusion language model pre-training, paving the way for more resource-efficient and capable multimodal AI systems.</p>

We start by presenting a set of desirable properties that explainers would ideally satisfy, delve into their relationships, and highlight incompatibilities of some of them. We identify the entire family of explainers that satisfy two key properties which are compatible with all the others. Its instances provide sufficient reasons, called weak abductive explanations.We then unravel its various subfamilies that satisfy subsets of compatible properties. Indeed, we fully characterize all the explainers that satisfy any subset of compatible properties. In particular, we introduce the first (broad family of) explainers that guarantee the existence of explanations and their global consistency.We discuss some of its instances including the irrefutable explainer and the surrogate explainer whose explanations can be found in polynomial time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Binchi Zhang, Minnan Luo, Shangbin Feng, Ziqi Liu, Jun Zhou, Qinghua Zheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has become an important research topic in response to the increasing scale and the distributed nature of graph-structured data in the real world. In FGL, a global graph is distributed across different clients, where each client holds a subgraph. Existing FGL methods often fail to effectively utilize cross-client edges, losing structural information during the training; additionally, local graphs often exhibit significant distribution divergence. These two issues make local models in FGL less desirable than in centralized graph learning, namely the local bias problem in this paper. To solve this problem, we propose a novel FGL framework to make the local models similar to the model trained in a centralized setting. Specifically, we design a distributed learning scheme, fully leveraging cross-client edges to aggregate information from other clients. In addition, we propose a label-guided sampling approach to alleviate the imbalanced local data and meanwhile, distinctly reduce the training overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that local bias can compromise the model performance and slow down the convergence during training. Experimental results also verify that our framework successfully mitigates local bias, achieving better performance than other baselines with lower time and memory overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianhai Yu, Liang Shen, Hongxiang Hao, Weibao Gong, Huachao Wu, Jiang Bian, Lirong Dai, Haoyi Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: While modern internet services, such as chatbots, search engines, and online advertising, demand the use of large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), distributed training and inference over heterogeneous computing systems are desired to facilitate these DNN models. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is one the most common strategies to lower the cost of training subject to the overall size of models/data through gating and parallelism in a divide-and-conquer fashion. While DeepSpeed has made efforts in carrying out large-scale MoE training over heterogeneous infrastructures, the efficiency of training and inference could be further improved from several system aspects, including load balancing, communication/computation efficiency, and memory footprint limits. In this work, we present a novel MoESys that boosts efficiency in both large-scale training and inference. Specifically, in the training procedure, the proposed MoESys adopts an Elastic MoE training strategy with 2D prefetch and Fusion communication over Hierarchical storage, so as to enjoy efficient parallelisms. For scalable inference in a single node, especially when the model size is larger than GPU memory, MoESys builds the CPU-GPU memory jointly into a ring of sections to load the model, and executes the computation tasks across the memory sections in a round-robin manner for efficient inference. We carried out extensive experiments to evaluate MoESys, where MoESys successfully trains a Unified Feature Optimization (UFO) model with a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts model of 12B parameters in 8 days on 48 A100 GPU cards. The comparison against the state-of-the-art shows that MoESys outperformed DeepSpeed with 33% higher throughput (tokens per second) in training and 13% higher throughput in inference in general. Particularly, under unbalanced MoE Tasks, e.g., UFO, MoESys achieved 64% higher throughput with 18% lower memory footprints.</p>

<p>Abstract: In model-based reinforcement learning (RL), an agent can leverage a learned model to improve its way of behaving in different ways. Two of the prevalent ways to do this are through decision-time and background planning methods. In this study, we are interested in understanding how the value-based versions of these two planning methods will compare against each other across different settings. Towards this goal, we first consider the simplest instantiations of value-based decision-time and background planning methods and provide theoretical results on which one will perform better in the regular RL and transfer learning settings. Then, we consider the modern instantiations of them and provide hypotheses on which one will perform better in the same settings. Finally, we perform illustrative experiments to validate these theoretical results and hypotheses. Overall, our findings suggest that even though value-based versions of the two planning methods perform on par in their simplest instantiations, the modern instantiations of value-based decision-time planning methods can perform on par or better than the modern instantiations of value-based background planning methods in both the regular RL and transfer learning settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this paper we study probabilistic and neural network approximations for solutions to Poisson equation subject to Holder data in general bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We aim at two fundamental goals.
  The first, and the most important, we show that the solution to Poisson equation can be numerically approximated in the sup-norm by Monte Carlo methods, and that this can be done highly efficiently if we use a modified version of the walk on spheres algorithm as an acceleration method. This provides estimates which are efficient with respect to the prescribed approximation error and with polynomial complexity in the dimension and the reciprocal of the error. A crucial feature is that the overall number of samples does not not depend on the point at which the approximation is performed.
  As a second goal, we show that the obtained Monte Carlo solver renders in a constructive way ReLU deep neural network (DNN) solutions to Poisson problem, whose sizes depend at most polynomialy in the dimension $d$ and in the desired error. In fact we show that the random DNN provides with high probability a small approximation error and low polynomial complexity in the dimension.</p>

<p>Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning have led to its successful application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens. Central to our work is the idea that the transition dynamics induce a low dimensional manifold of reachable states embedded in the high-dimensional nominal state space. We prove that, under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is at most the dimensionality of the action space plus one. This is the first result of its kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo environments. We further demonstrate the applicability of our result by learning a policy in this low dimensional representation. To do so we introduce an algorithm that learns a mapping to a low dimensional representation, as a narrow hidden layer of a deep neural network, in tandem with the policy using DDPG. Our experiments show that a policy learnt this way perform on par or better for four MuJoCo control suite tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current state-of-the-art deep networks are all powered by backpropagation. In this paper, we explore alternatives to full backpropagation in the form of blockwise learning rules, leveraging the latest developments in self-supervised learning. We show that a blockwise pretraining procedure consisting of training independently the 4 main blocks of layers of a ResNet-50 with Barlow Twins' loss function at each block performs almost as well as end-to-end backpropagation on ImageNet: a linear probe trained on top of our blockwise pretrained model obtains a top-1 classification accuracy of 70.48%, only 1.1% below the accuracy of an end-to-end pretrained network (71.57% accuracy). We perform extensive experiments to understand the impact of different components within our method and explore a variety of adaptations of self-supervised learning to the blockwise paradigm, building an exhaustive understanding of the critical avenues for scaling local learning rules to large networks, with implications ranging from hardware design to neuroscience.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current AI-assisted protein design mainly utilizes protein sequential and structural information. Meanwhile, there exists tremendous knowledge curated by humans in the text format describing proteins' high-level functionalities. Yet, whether the incorporation of such text data can help protein design tasks has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we propose ProteinDT, a multi-modal framework that leverages textual descriptions for protein design. ProteinDT consists of three subsequent steps: ProteinCLAP which aligns the representation of two modalities, a facilitator that generates the protein representation from the text modality, and a decoder that creates the protein sequences from the representation. To train ProteinDT, we construct a large dataset, SwissProtCLAP, with 441K text and protein pairs. We quantitatively verify the effectiveness of ProteinDT on three challenging tasks: (1) over 90\% accuracy for text-guided protein generation; (2) best hit ratio on 12 zero-shot text-guided protein editing tasks; (3) superior performance on four out of six protein property prediction benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Mandal, Seo Taek Kong, Dimitrios Katselis, R. Srikant</p>
<p>Abstract: The Dawid-Skene model is the most widely assumed model in the analysis of crowdsourcing algorithms that estimate ground-truth labels from noisy worker responses. In this work, we are motivated by crowdsourcing applications where workers have distinct skill sets and their accuracy additionally depends on a task's type. While weighted majority vote (WMV) with a single weight vector for each worker achieves the optimal label estimation error in the Dawid-Skene model, we show that different weights for different types are necessary for a multi-type model. Focusing on the case where there are two types of tasks, we propose a spectral method to partition tasks into two groups that cluster tasks by type. Our analysis reveals that task types can be perfectly recovered if the number of workers $n$ scales logarithmically with the number of tasks $d$. Any algorithm designed for the Dawid-Skene model can then be applied independently to each type to infer the labels. Numerical experiments show how clustering tasks by type before estimating ground-truth labels enhances the performance of crowdsourcing algorithms in practical applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jesus Solano, Mardhiyah Sanni, Oana-Maria Camburu, Pasquale Minervini</p>
<p>Abstract: Models that generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for their predictions have recently gained increasing interest. However, this approach usually demands large datasets of human-written NLEs for the ground-truth answers at training time, which can be expensive and potentially infeasible for some applications. When only a few NLEs are available (a few-shot setup), fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) in conjunction with prompt-based learning has recently shown promising results. However, PLMs typically have billions of parameters, making full fine-tuning expensive. We propose SparseFit, a sparse few-shot fine-tuning strategy that leverages discrete prompts to jointly generate predictions and NLEs. We experiment with SparseFit on three sizes of the T5 language model and four datasets and compare it against existing state-of-the-art Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. We find that fine-tuning only 6.8% of the model parameters leads to competitive results for both the task performance and the quality of the generated NLEs compared to full fine-tuning of the model and produces better results on average than other PEFT methods in terms of predictive accuracy and NLE quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weifeng Chen, Yatai Ji, Jie Wu, Hefeng Wu, Pan Xie, Jiashi Li, Xin Xia, Xuefeng Xiao, Liang Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled impressive image generation capabilities guided by text prompts. However, extending these techniques to video generation remains challenging, with existing text-to-video (T2V) methods often struggling to produce high-quality and motion-consistent videos. In this work, we introduce Control-A-Video, a controllable T2V diffusion model that can generate videos conditioned on text prompts and reference control maps like edge and depth maps. To tackle video quality and motion consistency issues, we propose novel strategies to incorporate content prior and motion prior into the diffusion-based generation process. Specifically, we employ a first-frame condition scheme to transfer video generation from the image domain. Additionally, we introduce residual-based and optical flow-based noise initialization to infuse motion priors from reference videos, promoting relevance among frame latents for reduced flickering. Furthermore, we present a Spatio-Temporal Reward Feedback Learning (ST-ReFL) algorithm that optimizes the video diffusion model using multiple reward models for video quality and motion consistency, leading to superior outputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality, more consistent videos compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in controllable text-to-video generation</p>

<p>Abstract: Traditional biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) models, designed for specific tasks or modalities, often exhibit limited flexibility in real-world deployment and struggle to utilize holistic information. Generalist AI holds the potential to address these limitations due to its versatility in interpreting different data types and generating tailored outputs for diverse needs. However, existing biomedical generalist AI solutions are typically heavyweight and closed source to researchers, practitioners, and patients. Here, we propose BiomedGPT, the first open-source and lightweight vision-language foundation model, designed as a generalist capable of performing various biomedical tasks. BiomedGPT achieved state-of-the-art results in 16 out of 25 experiments while maintaining a computing-friendly model scale. We also conducted human evaluations to assess the capabilities of BiomedGPT in radiology visual question answering, report generation, and summarization. BiomedGPT exhibits robust prediction ability with a low error rate of 3.8% in question answering, satisfactory performance with an error rate of 8.3% in writing complex radiology reports, and competitive summarization ability with a nearly equivalent preference score to human experts. Our method demonstrates that effective training with diverse data can lead to more practical biomedical AI for improving diagnosis and workflow efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuhang Zang, Wei Li, Jun Han, Kaiyang Zhou, Chen Change Loy</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are remarkable in vision-language tasks, such as image captioning and question answering, but lack the essential perception ability, i.e., object detection. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a novel research problem of contextual object detection -- understanding visible objects within different human-AI interactive contexts. Three representative scenarios are investigated, including the language cloze test, visual captioning, and question answering. Moreover, we present ContextDET, a unified multimodal model that is capable of end-to-end differentiable modeling of visual-language contexts, so as to locate, identify, and associate visual objects with language inputs for human-AI interaction. Our ContextDET involves three key submodels: (i) a visual encoder for extracting visual representations, (ii) a pre-trained LLM for multimodal context decoding, and (iii) a visual decoder for predicting bounding boxes given contextual object words. The new generate-then-detect framework enables us to detect object words within human vocabulary. Extensive experiments show the advantages of ContextDET on our proposed CODE benchmark, open-vocabulary detection, and referring image segmentation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ao Liu, Wenshan Li, Tao Li, Beibei Li, Guangquan Xu, Pan Zhou, Wengang Ma, Hanyuan Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenqi Shao, Meng Lei, Yutao Hu, Peng Gao, Kaipeng Zhang, Fanqing Meng, Peng Xu, Siyuan Huang, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Among these cutting-edge developments, Google's Bard stands out for its remarkable multimodal capabilities, promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence, through quantitative evaluation of $42$ standard text-related visual benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs' predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere $2.1$K image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhenrong Zhang, Jianan Liu, Yuxuan Xia, Tao Huang, Qing-Long Han, Hongbin Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Online multi-object tracking (MOT) plays a pivotal role in autonomous systems. The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states. Our proposed method utilizing LiDAR alone has shown exceptional performance compared to other online tracking approaches, including LiDAR-based and LiDAR-camera fusion-based methods. LEGO ranked 1st at the time of submitting results to KITTI object tracking evaluation ranking board and remains 2nd at the time of submitting this paper, among all online trackers in the KITTI MOT benchmark for cars1</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Radek Svoboda, Sebastian Basterrech, Jedrzej Kozal, Jan Platos, Michal Wozniak</p>
<p>Abstract: Forecasting natural gas consumption, considering seasonality and trends, is crucial in planning its supply and consumption and optimizing the cost of obtaining it, mainly by industrial entities. However, in times of threats to its supply, it is also a critical element that guarantees the supply of this raw material to meet individual consumers' needs, ensuring society's energy security. This article introduces a novel multistep ahead forecasting of natural gas consumption with change point detection integration for model collection selection with continual learning capabilities using data stream processing. The performance of the forecasting models based on the proposed approach is evaluated in a complex real-world use case of natural gas consumption forecasting. We employed Hoeffding tree predictors as forecasting models and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm for the change point detection procedure. The change point detection integration enables selecting a different model collection for successive time frames. Thus, three model collection selection procedures (with and without an error feedback loop) are defined and evaluated for forecasting scenarios with various densities of detected change points. These models were compared with change point agnostic baseline approaches. Our experiments show that fewer change points result in a lower forecasting error regardless of the model collection selection procedure employed. Also, simpler model collection selection procedures omitting forecasting error feedback leads to more robust forecasting models suitable for continual learning tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research in explainable AI (XAI) aims to provide insights into the decision-making process of opaque AI models. To date, most XAI methods offer one-off and static explanations, which cannot cater to the diverse backgrounds and understanding levels of users. With this paper, we investigate if free-form conversations can enhance users' comprehension of static explanations, improve acceptance and trust in the explanation methods, and facilitate human-AI collaboration. Participants are presented with static explanations, followed by a conversation with a human expert regarding the explanations. We measure the effect of the conversation on participants' ability to choose, from three machine learning models, the most accurate one based on explanations and their self-reported comprehension, acceptance, and trust. Empirical results show that conversations significantly improve comprehension, acceptance, trust, and collaboration. Our findings highlight the importance of customized model explanations in the format of free-form conversations and provide insights for the future design of conversational explanations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhao Kang, Youqi Liao, Jianping Li, Fuxun Liang, Yuhao Li, Xianghong Zou, Fangning Li, Xieyuanli Chen, Zhen Dong, Bisheng Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental task for robots and autonomous vehicles to achieve cross-modality data fusion and localization. Current I2P registration methods primarily focus on estimating correspondences at the point or pixel level, often neglecting global alignment. As a result, I2P matching can easily converge to a local optimum if it lacks high-level guidance from global constraints. To improve the success rate and general robustness, this paper introduces CoFiI2P, a novel I2P registration network that extracts correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, the image and point cloud data are processed through a two-stream encoder-decoder network for hierarchical feature extraction. Second, a coarse-to-fine matching module is designed to leverage these features and establish robust feature correspondences. Specifically, In the coarse matching phase, a novel I2P transformer module is employed to capture both homogeneous and heterogeneous global information from the image and point cloud data. This enables the estimation of coarse super-point/super-pixel matching pairs with discriminative descriptors. In the fine matching module, point/pixel pairs are established with the guidance of super-point/super-pixel correspondences. Finally, based on matching pairs, the transform matrix is estimated with the EPnP-RANSAC algorithm. Experiments conducted on the KITTI Odometry dataset demonstrate that CoFiI2P achieves impressive results, with a relative rotation error (RRE) of 1.14 degrees and a relative translation error (RTE) of 0.29 meters, while maintaining real-time speed.Additional experiments on the Nuscenes datasets confirm our method's generalizability.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences. Our project page is at: https://minnesotanlp.github.io/cobbler.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Itamar Mishani, Hayden Feddock, Maxim Likhachev</p>
<p>Abstract: Robotic manipulators are essential for future autonomous systems, yet limited trust in their autonomy has confined them to rigid, task-specific systems. The intricate configuration space of manipulators, coupled with the challenges of obstacle avoidance and constraint satisfaction, often makes motion planning the bottleneck for achieving reliable and adaptable autonomy. Recently, a class of constant-time motion planners (CTMP) was introduced. These planners employ a preprocessing phase to compute data structures that enable online planning provably guarantee the ability to generate motion plans, potentially sub-optimal, within a user defined time bound. This framework has been demonstrated to be effective in a number of time-critical tasks. However, robotic systems often have more time allotted for planning than the online portion of CTMP requires, time that can be used to improve the solution. To this end, we propose an anytime refinement approach that works in combination with CTMP algorithms. Our proposed framework, as it operates as a constant time algorithm, rapidly generates an initial solution within a user-defined time threshold. Furthermore, functioning as an anytime algorithm, it iteratively refines the solution's quality within the allocated time budget. This enables our approach to strike a balance between guaranteed fast plan generation and the pursuit of optimization over time. We support our approach by elucidating its analytical properties, showing the convergence of the anytime component towards optimal solutions. Additionally, we provide empirical validation through simulation and real-world demonstrations on a 6 degree-of-freedom robot manipulator, applied to an assembly domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuling Gu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark</p>
<p>Abstract: While LLMs can provide reasoned explanations along with their answers, the nature and quality of those explanations are still poorly understood. In response, our goal is to define a detailed way of characterizing the explanation capabilities of modern models and to create a nuanced, interpretable explanation evaluation tool that can generate such characterizations automatically, without relying on expensive API calls or human annotations. Our approach is to (a) define the new task of explanation critiquing - identifying and categorizing any main flaw in an explanation and providing suggestions to address the flaw, (b) create a sizeable, human-verified dataset for this task, and (c) train an open-source, automatic critique model (called Digital Socrates) using this data. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how Digital Socrates is useful for revealing insights about student models by examining their reasoning chains, and how it can provide high-quality, nuanced, automatic evaluation of those model explanations for the first time. Digital Socrates thus fills an important gap in evaluation tools for understanding and improving the explanation behavior of models.</p>

This article aims to comprehensively review adversarial example-generation techniques in the QA field, including textual and multimodal contexts. We examine the techniques employed through systematic categorization, providing a comprehensive, structured review. Beginning with an overview of traditional QA models, we traverse the adversarial example generation by exploring rule-based perturbations and advanced generative models. We then extend our research to include multimodal QA systems, analyze them across various methods, and examine generative models, seq2seq architectures, and hybrid methodologies. Our research grows to different defense strategies, adversarial datasets, and evaluation metrics and illustrates the comprehensive literature on adversarial QA. Finally, the paper considers the future landscape of adversarial question generation, highlighting potential research directions that can advance textual and multimodal QA systems in the context of adversarial challenges.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaoheng Fang, Rui Ye, Wenhao Wang, Zuhong Liu, Yuxiao Wang, Yafei Wang, Siheng Chen, Yanfeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Roadside unit (RSU) can significantly improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors. Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training. However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value. In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation. In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation. Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private. With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU. To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF. The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Insu Choi, Woosung Koh, Gimin Kang, Yuntae Jang, Woo Chang Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Modeling time series data remains a pervasive issue as the temporal dimension is inherent to numerous domains. Despite significant strides in time series forecasting, high noise-to-signal ratio, non-normality, non-stationarity, and lack of data continue challenging practitioners. In response, we leverage a simple representation augmentation technique to overcome these challenges. Our augmented representation acts as a statistical-space prior encoded at each time step. In response, we name our method Statistical-space Augmented Representation (SSAR). The underlying high-dimensional data-generating process inspires our representation augmentation. We rigorously examine the empirical generalization performance on two data sets with two downstream temporal learning algorithms. Our approach significantly beats all five up-to-date baselines. Moreover, the highly modular nature of our approach can easily be applied to various settings. Lastly, fully-fledged theoretical perspectives are available throughout the writing for a clear and rigorous understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelong Li, Wenyue Hua, Hao Wang, He Zhu, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) enable AI Agents to automatically generate and execute multi-step plans to solve complex tasks. However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel "Formal-LLM" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wenyue Hua, Xianjun Yang, Mingyu Jin, Wei Cheng, Ruixiang Tang, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents shows great potential to revolutionize task planning, capturing significant attention. Given that these agents will be integrated into high-stake domains, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent's safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but also enhances the helpfulness of the agent. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the LLM reasoning ability in adhering to the Constitution. This paper sheds light on how to ensure the safe integration of LLM-based agents into human-centric environments. Data and code are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/TrustAgent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haobin Jiang, Ziluo Ding, Zongqing Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: Exploration in decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces two challenges. One is that the novelty of global states is unavailable, while the novelty of local observations is biased. The other is how agents can explore in a coordinated way. To address these challenges, we propose MACE, a simple yet effective multi-agent coordinated exploration method. By communicating only local novelty, agents can take into account other agents' local novelty to approximate the global novelty. Further, we newly introduce weighted mutual information to measure the influence of one agent's action on other agents' accumulated novelty. We convert it as an intrinsic reward in hindsight to encourage agents to exert more influence on other agents' exploration and boost coordinated exploration. Empirically, we show that MACE achieves superior performance in three multi-agent environments with sparse rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anna L. Trella, Walter Dempsey, Finale Doshi-Velez, Susan A. Murphy</p>
<p>Abstract: We consider the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with non-stationary rewards. We present a novel formulation of non-stationarity in the environment where changes in the mean reward of the arms over time are due to some unknown, latent, auto-regressive (AR) state of order $k$. We call this new environment the latent AR bandit. Different forms of the latent AR bandit appear in many real-world settings, especially in emerging scientific fields such as behavioral health or education where there are few mechanistic models of the environment. If the AR order $k$ is known, we propose an algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(k\sqrt{T})$ regret in this setting. Empirically, our algorithm outperforms standard UCB across multiple non-stationary environments, even if $k$ is mis-specified.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chongzhi Zhang, Zhiping Peng, Junhao Zheng, Qianli Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a challenging task. Given that KGs are usually incomplete, neural models are proposed to solve CQA by performing multi-hop logical reasoning. However, most of them cannot perform well on both one-hop and multi-hop queries simultaneously. Recent work proposes a logical message passing mechanism based on the pre-trained neural link predictors. While effective on both one-hop and multi-hop queries, it ignores the difference between the constant and variable nodes in a query graph. In addition, during the node embedding update stage, this mechanism cannot dynamically measure the importance of different messages, and whether it can capture the implicit logical dependencies related to a node and received messages remains unclear. In this paper, we propose Conditional Logical Message Passing Transformer (CLMPT), which considers the difference between constants and variables in the case of using pre-trained neural link predictors and performs message passing conditionally on the node type. We empirically verified that this approach can reduce computational costs without affecting performance. Furthermore, CLMPT uses the transformer to aggregate received messages and update the corresponding node embedding. Through the self-attention mechanism, CLMPT can assign adaptive weights to elements in an input set consisting of received messages and the corresponding node and explicitly model logical dependencies between various elements. Experimental results show that CLMPT is a new state-of-the-art neural CQA model. https://github.com/qianlima-lab/CLMPT.</p>

<p>Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms offer great potential for personalizing treatment for participants in clinical trials. However, deploying an online, autonomous algorithm in the high-stakes healthcare setting makes quality control and data quality especially difficult to achieve. This paper proposes algorithm fidelity as a critical requirement for deploying online RL algorithms in clinical trials. It emphasizes the responsibility of the algorithm to (1) safeguard participants and (2) preserve the scientific utility of the data for post-trial analyses. We also present a framework for pre-deployment planning and real-time monitoring to help algorithm developers and clinical researchers ensure algorithm fidelity. To illustrate our framework's practical application, we present real-world examples from the Oralytics clinical trial. Since Spring 2023, this trial successfully deployed an autonomous, online RL algorithm to personalize behavioral interventions for participants at risk for dental disease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Priyam Sahoo, Saurabh Pujar, Ganesh Nalawade, Richard Gebhardt, Louis Mandel, Luca Buratti</p>
<p>Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) which can generate code, has made it possible to create tools that improve developer productivity. Integrated development environments or IDEs which developers use to write software are often used as an interface to interact with LLMs. Although many such tools have been released, almost all of them focus on general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages, such as those crucial for Information Technology (IT) automation, have not received much attention. Ansible is one such YAML-based IT automation-specific language. Ansible Lightspeed is an LLM-based service designed explicitly to generate Ansible YAML given natural language prompt.
  This paper first presents the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service. We then evaluate its utility to developers using diverse indicators, including extended utilization, analysis of user rejected suggestions, as well as analysis of user sentiments. The analysis is based on data collected for 10,696 real users including 3,910 returning users. The code for Ansible Lightspeed service and the analysis framework is made available for others to use.
  To our knowledge, our study is the first to involve thousands of users in evaluating code assistants for domain-specific languages. We propose an improved version of user acceptance rate and we are the first code completion tool to present N-Day user retention figures. With our findings we provide insights into the effectiveness of small, dedicated models in a domain-specific context. We hope this work serves as a reference for software engineering and machine learning researchers exploring code completion services for domain-specific languages in particular and programming languages in general.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunwei Bai, Ying Kiat Tan, Shiming Chen, Yao Shu, Tsuhan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Few-shot-learning (FSL) commonly requires a model to identify images (queries) that belong to classes unseen during training, based on a few labeled samples of the new classes (support set) as reference. So far, plenty of algorithms involve training data augmentation to improve the generalization capability of FSL models, but outlier queries or support images during inference can still pose great generalization challenges. In this work, to reduce the bias caused by the outlier samples, we generate additional test-class samples by combining original samples with suitable train-class samples via a generative image combiner. Then, we obtain averaged features via an augmentor, which leads to more typical representations through the averaging. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., obtaining a test accuracy improvement proportion of around 10% (e.g., from 46.86% to 53.28%) for trained FSL models. Importantly, given pretrained image combiner, our method is training-free for off-the-shelf FSL models, whose performance can be improved without extra datasets nor further training of the models themselves.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shirin Vafaei, Ryohei Fukuma, Huixiang Yang, Haruhiko Kishima, Takufumi Yanagisawa</p>
<p>Abstract: Developing algorithms for accurate neural decoding of mental contents is a long-cherished goal in the field of neuroscience. Brain decoding is typically employed by training machine learning models to map neural data into a pretrained feature vector representation of stimuli. These vectors are usually driven from imagebased and/or text-based feature spaces. This implies that their intrinsic characteristics might be fundamentally different than those encoded in neural activity patterns, resulting in limiting the capability of brain decoders to accurately learn this mapping. To address this issue, we propose a representation learning framework, termed brain-grounding of semantic vectors, that fine-tunes pretrained feature vectors to better align with the structure of neural representation of visual stimuli in the human brain. We trained this model with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of 150 visual stimuli categories and then performed zero-shot brain decoding on 1) fMRI, 2) magnetoencephalography (MEG), and 3) electrocorticography (ECoG) neural data of visual stimuli. Our results demonstrated that by using the fMRI-based brain-grounded vectors, the zero-shot decoding accuracy of brain data from all three neuroimaging modalities increases. These findings underscore the potential of incorporating a richer array of brain-derived features to enhance the performance of brain decoding algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinhong Liu, Han Zhou, Zhijiang Guo, Ehsan Shareghi, Ivan Vuli\'c, Anna Korhonen, Nigel Collier</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities as automatic evaluators in assessing the quality of generated natural language. However, LLMs still exhibit biases in evaluation and often struggle to generate coherent evaluations that align with human assessments. In this work, we first conduct a systematic study of the misalignment between LLM evaluators and human judgement, revealing that existing calibration methods aimed at mitigating biases are insufficient for effectively aligning LLM evaluators. Inspired by the use of preference data in RLHF, we formulate the evaluation as a ranking problem and introduce Pairwise-preference Search (PairS), an uncertainty-guided search method that employs LLMs to conduct pairwise comparisons and efficiently ranks candidate texts. PairS achieves state-of-the-art performance on representative evaluation tasks and demonstrates significant improvements over direct scoring. Furthermore, we provide insights into the role of pairwise preference in quantifying the transitivity of LLMs and demonstrate how PairS benefits from calibration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Harry Dong, Beidi Chen, Yuejie Chi</p>
<p>Abstract: With the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), they have been applied to many fields due to their remarkable utility, but this comes at a considerable computational cost at deployment. Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free and calibration-free method that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.29$\times$ and 1.25$\times$ speed-ups in Gemma 7B and Llama 2 13B, respectively, on an NVIDIA L40).

<p>Abstract: The widespread adoption and transformative effects of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns regarding their capacity to produce inaccurate and fictitious content, referred to as `hallucinations'. Given the potential risks associated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This research aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants (N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Participants ranked content as truthful in the order of genuine, minor hallucination, and major hallucination, and user engagement behaviors mirrored this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning improved the detection of hallucination without significantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations.

<p>Abstract: Generating accurate step-by-step reasoning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex problems and enhance robustness and interpretability. Despite the flux of research on developing advanced reasoning approaches, systematically analyzing the diverse LLMs and reasoning strategies in generating reasoning chains remains a significant challenge. The difficulties stem from the lack of two key elements: (1) an automatic method for evaluating the generated reasoning chains on different tasks, and (2) a unified formalism and implementation of the diverse reasoning approaches for systematic comparison. This paper aims to close the gap: (1) We introduce AutoRace for fully automated reasoning chain evaluation. Existing metrics rely on expensive human annotations or pre-defined LLM prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically creates detailed evaluation criteria tailored for each task, and uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation following the criteria. (2) We develop LLM Reasoners, a library for standardized modular implementation of existing and new reasoning algorithms, under a unified formulation of the search, reward, and world model components. With the new evaluation and library, (3) we conduct extensive study of different reasoning approaches (e.g., CoT, ToT, RAP). The analysis reveals interesting findings about different factors contributing to reasoning, including the reward-guidance, breadth-vs-depth in search, world model, and prompt formats, etc.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite the remarkable achievements of language models (LMs) across a broad spectrum of tasks, their propensity for generating toxic outputs remains a prevalent concern. Current solutions involving finetuning or auxiliary models usually require extensive computational resources, hindering their practicality in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose DeStein, a novel method that detoxifies LMs by applying representation engineering in activation spaces with lower resource and time costs. Specifically, we derive detoxification vectors from self-induced, universal steering pairs through arithmetic operations in activation spaces. During inference, detoxification is achieved by fusing the detoxification vectors with the original representations in a head-wise manner. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on various metrics, while also maintaining satisfactory generation quality and diversity. We further validate the practicality and scalability of DeStein with a series of white-box LLMs. The method is open-sourced at https://github.com/LizLizLi/DeStein.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mark Sch\"one, Neeraj Mohan Sushma, Jingyue Zhuge, Christian Mayr, Anand Subramoney, David Kappel</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based sensors are well suited for real-time processing due to their fast response times and encoding of the sensory data as successive temporal differences. These and other valuable properties, such as a high dynamic range, are suppressed when the data is converted to a frame-based format. However, most current methods either collapse events into frames or cannot scale up when processing the event data directly event-by-event. In this work, we address the key challenges of scaling up event-by-event modeling of the long event streams emitted by such sensors, which is a particularly relevant problem for neuromorphic computing. While prior methods can process up to a few thousand time steps, our model, based on modern recurrent deep state-space models, scales to event streams of millions of events for both training and inference.We leverage their stable parameterization for learning long-range dependencies, parallelizability along the sequence dimension, and their ability to integrate asynchronous events effectively to scale them up to long event streams.We further augment these with novel event-centric techniques enabling our model to match or beat the state-of-the-art performance on several event stream benchmarks. In the Spiking Speech Commands task, we improve state-of-the-art by a large margin of 6.6% to 87.1%. On the DVS128-Gestures dataset, we achieve competitive results without using frames or convolutional neural networks. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to use fully event-based processing with purely recurrent networks to achieve state-of-the-art task performance in several event-based benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: As cyber threats and malware attacks increasingly alarm both individuals and businesses, the urgency for proactive malware countermeasures intensifies. This has driven a rising interest in automated machine learning solutions. Transformers, a cutting-edge category of attention-based deep learning methods, have demonstrated remarkable success. In this paper, we present BERTroid, an innovative malware detection model built on the BERT architecture. Overall, BERTroid emerged as a promising solution for combating Android malware. Its ability to outperform state-of-the-art solutions demonstrates its potential as a proactive defense mechanism against malicious software attacks. Additionally, we evaluate BERTroid on multiple datasets to assess its performance across diverse scenarios. In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, our approach has demonstrated promising resilience against the rapid evolution of malware on Android systems. While the machine learning model captures broad patterns, we emphasize the role of manual validation for deeper comprehension and insight into these behaviors. This human intervention is critical for discerning intricate and context-specific behaviors, thereby validating and reinforcing the model's findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Riccardo Simionato, Stefano Fasciani</p>
<p>Abstract: Analog electronic circuits are at the core of an important category of musical devices. The nonlinear features of their electronic components give analog musical devices a distinctive timbre and sound quality, making them highly desirable. Artificial neural networks have rapidly gained popularity for the emulation of analog audio effects circuits, particularly recurrent networks. While neural approaches have been successful in accurately modeling distortion circuits, they require architectural improvements that account for parameter conditioning and low latency response. In this article, we explore the application of recent machine learning advancements for virtual analog modeling. We compare State Space models and Linear Recurrent Units against the more common Long Short Term Memory networks. These have shown promising ability in sequence to sequence modeling tasks, showing a notable improvement in signal history encoding. Our comparative study uses these black box neural modeling techniques with a variety of audio effects. We evaluate the performance and limitations using multiple metrics aiming to assess the models' ability to accurately replicate energy envelopes, frequency contents, and transients in the audio signal. To incorporate control parameters we employ the Feature wise Linear Modulation method. Long Short Term Memory networks exhibit better accuracy in emulating distortions and equalizers, while the State Space model, followed by Long Short Term Memory networks when integrated in an encoder decoder structure, outperforms others in emulating saturation and compression. When considering long time variant characteristics, the State Space model demonstrates the greatest accuracy. The Long Short Term Memory and, in particular, Linear Recurrent Unit networks present more tendency to introduce audio artifacts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhihang Lin, Mingbao Lin, Luxi Lin, Rongrong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations for inference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokens needed for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are unnecessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for VTW, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance. Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/lzhxmu/VTW}.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lun Ai, Stephen H. Muggleton, Shi-Shun Liang, Geoff S. Baldwin</p>
<p>Abstract: Techniques to autonomously drive research have been prominent in Computational Scientific Discovery, while Synthetic Biology is a field of science that focuses on designing and constructing new biological systems for useful purposes. Here we seek to apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery. Comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) are often used to evaluate cellular engineering strategies to optimise target compound production. However, predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs, often due to errors in the models. The task of learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models to reliably engineer biological systems for producing useful compounds. It offers a realistic approach to creating a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yibin Wang, Weizhong Zhang, Changhai Zhou, Cheng Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Scene text synthesis involves rendering specified texts onto arbitrary images. Current methods typically formulate this task in an end-to-end manner but lack effective character-level guidance during training. Besides, their text encoders, pre-trained on a single font type, struggle to adapt to the diverse font styles encountered in practical applications. Consequently, these methods suffer from character distortion, repetition, and absence, particularly in polystylistic scenarios. To this end, this paper proposes DreamText for high-fidelity scene text synthesis. Our key idea is to reconstruct the diffusion training process, introducing more refined guidance tailored to this task, to expose and rectify the model's attention at the character level and strengthen its learning of text regions. This transformation poses a hybrid optimization challenge, involving both discrete and continuous variables. To effectively tackle this challenge, we employ a heuristic alternate optimization strategy. Meanwhile, we jointly train the text encoder and generator to comprehensively learn and utilize the diverse font present in the training dataset. This joint training is seamlessly integrated into the alternate optimization process, fostering a synergistic relationship between learning character embedding and re-estimating character attention. Specifically, in each step, we first encode potential character-generated position information from cross-attention maps into latent character masks. These masks are then utilized to update the representation of specific characters in the current step, which, in turn, enables the generator to correct the character's attention in the subsequent steps. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Toru Ishida, Tongxi Liu, Hailong Wang, William K. Cheunga</p>
<p>Abstract: Workshop courses designed to foster creativity are gaining popularity. However, even experienced faculty teams find it challenging to realize a holistic evaluation that accommodates diverse perspectives. Adequate deliberation is essential to integrate varied assessments, but faculty often lack the time for such exchanges. Deriving an average score without discussion undermines the purpose of a holistic evaluation. Therefore, this paper explores the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) as a facilitator to integrate diverse faculty assessments. Scenario-based experiments were conducted to determine if the LLM could integrate diverse evaluations and explain the underlying pedagogical theories to faculty. The results were noteworthy, showing that the LLM can effectively facilitate faculty discussions. Additionally, the LLM demonstrated the capability to create evaluation criteria by generalizing a single scenario-based experiment, leveraging its already acquired pedagogical domain knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linjia Kang, Songhua Zhou, Shuyan Fang, Shichao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular properties is crucial in drug discovery. Traditional methods often overlook that real-world molecules typically exhibit multiple property labels with complex correlations. To this end, we propose a novel framework, HiPM, which stands for hierarchical prompted molecular representation learning framework. HiPM leverages task-aware prompts to enhance the differential expression of tasks in molecular representations and mitigate negative transfer caused by conflicts in individual task information. Our framework comprises two core components: the Molecular Representation Encoder (MRE) and the Task-Aware Prompter (TAP). MRE employs a hierarchical message-passing network architecture to capture molecular features at both the atom and motif levels. Meanwhile, TAP utilizes agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to construct a prompt tree that reflects task affinity and distinctiveness, enabling the model to consider multi-granular correlation information among tasks, thereby effectively handling the complexity of multi-label property prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiPM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multi-label datasets, offering a novel perspective on multi-label molecular representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hai-Long Sun, Da-Wei Zhou, Yang Li, Shiyin Lu, Chao Yi, Qing-Guo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V has marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence. Existing methods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs' inherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as the training process evolves. We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT datasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to significantly reduced performance in non-English languages. This is due to the failure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during the SFT process. In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that utilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language level. Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens. Specifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the cross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the result of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant experts. The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens into language-specific visual tokens. Moreover, considering the current lack of benchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we collect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which includes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB. Our method not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual MMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks. Both the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly available. Code is available at: https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Parrot.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Hofweber, Peter Hase, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Do norms of rationality apply to machine learning models, in particular language models? In this paper we investigate this question by focusing on a special subset of rational norms: coherence norms. We consider both logical coherence norms as well as coherence norms tied to the strength of belief. To make sense of the latter, we introduce the Minimal Assent Connection (MAC) and propose a new account of credence, which captures the strength of belief in language models. This proposal uniformly assigns strength of belief simply on the basis of model internal next token probabilities. We argue that rational norms tied to coherence do apply to some language models, but not to others. This issue is significant since rationality is closely tied to predicting and explaining behavior, and thus it is connected to considerations about AI safety and alignment, as well as understanding model behavior more generally.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07791">Judging the Judges: A Systematic Investigation of Position Bias in Pairwise Comparative Assessments by LLMs</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Lin Shi, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge offers a promising alternative to human judges across various tasks, yet inherent biases, particularly position bias - a systematic preference for answers based on their position in the prompt - compromise its effectiveness. Our study investigates this issue by developing a framework to systematically study and quantify position bias using metrics such as repetitional consistency, positional consistency, and positional fairness. We conduct experiments with 9 judge models across 22 tasks from the MTBench and DevBench benchmarks and nearly 40 answer-generating models, generating approximately 80,000 evaluation instances. This comprehensive assessment reveals significant variations in bias across judges and tasks. Although GPT-4 often excels in positional consistency and fairness, some more cost-effective models perform comparably or even better in specific tasks, highlighting essential trade-offs between consistency, fairness, and cost. Our results also demonstrate high consistency of judgment across repetitions, confirming that position bias is not due to random variations. This research significantly contributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding position bias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluation. These insights guide the selection of optimal judge models, enhance benchmark design, and lay the foundation for future research into effective debiasing strategies, ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluators.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in general-purpose AI have highlighted the importance of guiding AI systems towards the intended goals, ethical principles, and values of individuals and groups, a concept broadly recognized as alignment. However, the lack of clarified definitions and scopes of human-AI alignment poses a significant obstacle, hampering collaborative efforts across research domains to achieve this alignment. In particular, ML- and philosophy-oriented alignment research often views AI alignment as a static, unidirectional process (i.e., aiming to ensure that AI systems' objectives match humans) rather than an ongoing, mutual alignment problem. This perspective largely neglects the long-term interaction and dynamic changes of alignment. To understand these gaps, we introduce a systematic review of over 400 papers published between 2019 and January 2024, spanning multiple domains such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML). We characterize, define and scope human-AI alignment. From this, we present a conceptual framework of "Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment" to organize the literature from a human-centered perspective. This framework encompasses both 1) conventional studies of aligning AI to humans that ensures AI produces the intended outcomes determined by humans, and 2) a proposed concept of aligning humans to AI, which aims to help individuals and society adjust to AI advancements both cognitively and behaviorally. Additionally, we articulate the key findings derived from literature analysis, including literature gaps and trends, human values, and interaction techniques. To pave the way for future studies, we envision three key challenges and give recommendations for future research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> A. Feder Cooper</p>
<p>Abstract: To develop rigorous knowledge about ML models -- and the systems in which they are embedded -- we need reliable measurements. But reliable measurement is fundamentally challenging, and touches on issues of reproducibility, scalability, uncertainty quantification, epistemology, and more. This dissertation addresses criteria needed to take reliability seriously: both criteria for designing meaningful metrics, and for methodologies that ensure that we can dependably and efficiently measure these metrics at scale and in practice. In doing so, this dissertation articulates a research vision for a new field of scholarship at the intersection of machine learning, law, and policy. Within this frame, we cover topics that fit under three different themes: (1) quantifying and mitigating sources of arbitrariness in ML, (2) taming randomness in uncertainty estimation and optimization algorithms, in order to achieve scalability without sacrificing reliability, and (3) providing methods for evaluating generative-AI systems, with specific focuses on quantifying memorization in language models and training latent diffusion models on open-licensed data. By making contributions in these three themes, this dissertation serves as an empirical proof by example that research on reliable measurement for machine learning is intimately and inescapably bound up with research in law and policy. These different disciplines pose similar research questions about reliable measurement in machine learning. They are, in fact, two complementary sides of the same research vision, which, broadly construed, aims to construct machine-learning systems that cohere with broader societal values.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingbo Shang, Zai Zheng, Jiale Wei, Xiang Ying, Felix Tao, Mindverse Team</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the world with the sparks of artificial general intelligence (AGI). One opinion, especially from some startups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context length can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the long-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown that their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed context length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further demonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long context and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper, we envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of \emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core processors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a large number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes. Compared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw data, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer, but also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an intermediate stage, the memory will likely be in the form of natural language descriptions, which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately, every agent/person should have its own large personal model, a deep neural network model (thus \emph{AI-native}) that parameterizes and compresses all types of memory, even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally, we discuss the significant potential of AI-native memory as the transformative infrastructure for (proactive) engagement, personalization, distribution, and social in the AGI era, as well as the incurred privacy and security challenges with preliminary solutions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) severity is determined by the presence and ratios of blast cells (abnormal white blood cells) in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. Manual diagnosis of this disease is a tedious and time-consuming operation, making it difficult for professionals to accurately examine blast cell characteristics. To address this difficulty, researchers use deep learning and machine learning. In this paper, a ResNet-based feature extractor is utilized to detect ALL, along with a variety of feature selectors and classifiers. To get the best results, a variety of transfer learning models, including the Resnet, VGG, EfficientNet, and DensNet families, are used as deep feature extractors. Following extraction, different feature selectors are used, including Genetic algorithm, PCA, ANOVA, Random Forest, Univariate, Mutual information, Lasso, XGB, Variance, and Binary ant colony. After feature qualification, a variety of classifiers are used, with MLP outperforming the others. The recommended technique is used to categorize ALL and HEM in the selected dataset which is C-NMC 2019. This technique got an impressive 90.71% accuracy and 95.76% sensitivity for the relevant classifications, and its metrics on this dataset outperformed others.</p>

<p>Abstract: Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neuropsychological research highlights the essential role of coordinated activities across brain regions during cognitive tasks. This study expands the existing EEG datasets by constructing the MEEG dataset, a multi-modal compilation of music-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and further investigates the brain network topology during emotional responses to music. The MEEG dataset, capturing emotional responses to various musical stimuli across different valence and arousal levels, enables an in-depth analysis of brainwave patterns within musical contexts. We introduce the Attention-based Temporal Learner with Dynamic Graph Neural Network (AT-DGNN), a novel framework for EEG emotion recognition. By integrating an attention mechanism with a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN), the AT-DGNN model captures complex local and global EEG dynamics, demonstrating superior performance with accuracy of 83.74% in arousal and 86.01% in valence, outperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Comparative analyses with traditional datasets like DEAP underscore our model's effectiveness, highlighting the potential of music as a potent emotional stimulus. This study advances graph-based learning techniques in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), significantly enhancing the precision of EEG-based emotion recognition and deepening our understanding of cognitive functions in various brain regions.

<p>Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based models have gained prominence in multivariate long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), demonstrating significant advancements despite facing challenges such as high computational demands, difficulty in capturing temporal dynamics, and managing long-term dependencies. The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyang Zhao, Xueying Jia, Vijay Viswanathan, Tongshuang Wu, Graham Neubig</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold the promise of solving diverse tasks when provided with appropriate natural language prompts. However, prompting often leads models to make predictions with lower accuracy compared to finetuning a model with ample training data. On the other hand, while finetuning LLMs on task-specific data generally improves their performance, abundant annotated datasets are not available for all tasks. Previous work has explored generating task-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune smaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other than the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and legal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In response to these, we propose SELF-GUIDE, a multi-stage mechanism in which we synthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use these input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical evaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that SELF-GUIDE improves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we report an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks and 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics. This sheds light on the promise of self-synthesized data guiding LLMs towards becoming task-specific experts without any external learning signals.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukrut Rao, Sweta Mahajan, Moritz B\"ohle, Bernt Schiele</p>
<p>Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have recently been proposed to address the 'black-box' problem of deep neural networks, by first mapping images to a human-understandable concept space and then linearly combining concepts for classification. Such models typically require first coming up with a set of concepts relevant to the task and then aligning the representations of a feature extractor to map to these concepts. However, even with powerful foundational feature extractors like CLIP, there are no guarantees that the specified concepts are detectable. In this work, we leverage recent advances in mechanistic interpretability and propose a novel CBM approach -- called Discover-then-Name-CBM (DN-CBM) -- that inverts the typical paradigm: instead of pre-selecting concepts based on the downstream classification task, we use sparse autoencoders to first discover concepts learnt by the model, and then name them and train linear probes for classification. Our concept extraction strategy is efficient, since it is agnostic to the downstream task, and uses concepts already known to the model. We perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets and CLIP architectures and show that our method yields semantically meaningful concepts, assigns appropriate names to them that make them easy to interpret, and yields performant and interpretable CBMs. Code available at https://github.com/neuroexplicit-saar/discover-then-name.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoguang Diao, Yubo Song, Subham Sahoo</p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper, we infer remote measurements such as remote voltages and currents online with change in AC power flows using spiking neural network (SNN) as grid-edge technology for efficient coordination of power electronic converters. This work unifies power and information as a means of data normalization using a multi-modal regime in the form of spikes using energy-efficient neuromorphic learning and event-driven asynchronous data collection. Firstly, we organize the synchronous real-valued measurements at each edge and translate them into asynchronous spike-based events to collect sparse data for training of SNN at each edge. Instead of relying on error-dependent supervised data-driven learning theory, we exploit the latency-driven unsupervised Hebbian learning rule to obtain modulation pulses for switching of power electronic converters that can now comprehend grid disturbances locally and adapt their operation without requiring explicit infrastructure for global coordination. Not only does this philosophy block exogenous path arrival for cyber attackers by dismissing the cyber layer, it also entails converter adaptation to system reconfiguration and parameter mismatch issues. We conclude this work by validating its energy-efficient and effective online learning performance under various scenarios in different system sizes, including modified IEEE 14-bus system and under experimental conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuoyan Xu, Zhenmei Shi, Yingyu Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AI problems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or more simple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach composite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remains an open and largely underexplored question. In this study, we delve into the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-context examples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks including linguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLM families. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different input segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represents one task, models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provides no improvements. We offer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that models exhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input parts separately. We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilities of LLMs in solving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and model scale.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Atul Kumar, Siddharth Garg, Soumya Dutta</p>
<p>Abstract: The widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has recently resulted in their application to challenging scientific visualization tasks. While advanced DNNs demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, understanding factors like prediction quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial. These insights aid application scientists in making informed decisions. However, DNNs lack inherent mechanisms to measure prediction uncertainty, prompting the creation of distinct frameworks for constructing robust uncertainty-aware models tailored to various visualization tasks. In this work, we develop uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model steady-state vector fields effectively. We comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, aimed at enabling uncertainty-informed visual analysis of features within steady vector field data. Our detailed exploration using several vector data sets indicate that uncertainty-aware models generate informative visualization results of vector field features. Furthermore, incorporating prediction uncertainty improves the resilience and interpretability of our DNN model, rendering it applicable for the analysis of non-trivial vector field data sets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer vision (CV) is one of the most crucial fields in artificial intelligence. In recent years, a variety of deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have been designed to tackle diverse problems in CV. These algorithms have found practical applications in areas such as robotics and facial recognition. Despite the increasing power of current CV models, several fundamental questions remain unresolved: Why do CNNs require deep layers? What ensures the generalization ability of CNNs? Why do residual-based networks outperform fully convolutional networks like VGG? What is the fundamental difference between residual-based CNNs and Transformer-based networks? Why can CNNs utilize LoRA and pruning techniques? The root cause of these questions lies in the lack of a robust theoretical foundation for deep learning models in CV. To address these critical issues and techniques, we employ the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to provide a theoretical basis for convolution- and Transformer-based models in CV. By doing so, we aim to elucidate these questions from a theoretical perspective.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20174">Advancing Multimodal Large Language Models in Chart Question Answering with Visualization-Referenced Instruction Tuning</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xingchen Zeng, Haichuan Lin, Yilin Ye, Wei Zeng</p>
<p>Abstract: Emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit great potential for chart question answering (CQA). Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks. We also contribute a dataset split as a benchmark for future research. Source codes and datasets of this paper are available at https://github.com/zengxingchen/ChartQA-MLLM.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a general approach to quantitatively assessing the risk and vulnerability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to biased decisions. The guiding principle of the proposed approach is that any AI algorithm must outperform a random guesser. This may appear trivial, but empirical results from a simplistic sequential decision-making scenario involving roulette games show that sophisticated AI-based approaches often underperform the random guesser by a significant margin. We highlight that modern recommender systems may exhibit a similar tendency to favor overly low-risk options. We argue that this "random guesser test" can serve as a useful tool for evaluating the utility of AI actions, and also points towards increasing exploration as a potential improvement to such systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei Wang, Qing Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thiziri Nait Saada, Valentina Di Proietto, Benoit Schmauch, Katharina Von Loga, Lucas Fidon</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models have proven effective for cancer prognosis from Whole Slide Images. However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</p>

<p>Abstract: This study aims to share a teaching experience teaching sound design for audiovisual productions and compares different projects tackled by students. It is not intended to be a comparative analysis of different types of teaching but rather an analysis of different problems observed in different profiles of students of the subject who study it in different grades. The world of audio can be very interesting for a large part of the students, both those with creative and technical inclinations. Musical creation and production, synchronization with images, dubbing, etc. They are disciplines that are generally interesting but can have a very high barrier to entry due to their great technical complexity. Sometimes it can take weeks or even months for the uninitiated to begin to use audio editing programs with the necessary ease, which are not always particularly intuitive for students. Learning through the use of PBL methodologies generates, in our experience, results much superior to those that can be observed through the use of other teaching methods such as master classes. Students acquire technical skills while developing creative projects in which they get personally involved. Despite everything mentioned above, most interactions between teachers and students focus on aspects of technical correction. From different parameters in reverbs (such as pre-delay, decay, modulation...) to how to correctly adjust compressors, noise gates, etc.; The number of tools with which to work with audio is incredibly extensive, as well as many of its features that can present serious differences depending on their manufacturers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel N. Nissani (Nissensohn)</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL) has been successfully applied to classification and other downstream tasks related to concrete concepts, such as objects contained in the ImageNet dataset. No attempts seem to have been made so far in applying this promising scheme to more abstract entities. A prominent example of these could be the concept of (discrete) Quantity. CL can be frequently interpreted as a self-supervised scheme guided by some profound and ubiquitous conservation principle (e.g. conservation of identity in object classification tasks). In this introductory work we apply a suitable conservation principle to the semi-abstract concept of natural numbers by which discrete quantities can be estimated or predicted. We experimentally show, by means of a toy problem, that contrastive learning can be trained to count at a glance with high accuracy both at human as well as at super-human ranges.. We compare this with the results of a trained-to-count at a glance supervised learning (SL) neural network scheme of similar architecture. We show that both schemes exhibit similar good performance on baseline experiments, where the distributions of the training and testing stages are equal. Importantly, we demonstrate that in some generalization scenarios, where training and testing distributions differ, CL boasts more robust and much better error performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data science, and similarity graph-based clustering is an important approach within this domain. Doubly stochastic symmetric similarity graphs provide numerous benefits for clustering problems and downstream tasks, yet learning such graphs remains a significant challenge. Marcus theorem states that a strictly positive symmetric matrix can be transformed into a doubly stochastic symmetric matrix by diagonal matrices. However, in clustering, learning sparse matrices is crucial for computational efficiency. We extend Marcus theorem by proposing the Marcus mapping, which indicates that certain sparse matrices can also be transformed into doubly stochastic symmetric matrices via diagonal matrices. Additionally, we introduce rank constraints into the clustering problem and propose the Doubly Stochastic Adaptive Neighbors Clustering algorithm based on the Marcus Mapping (ANCMM). This ensures that the learned graph naturally divides into the desired number of clusters. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we explore the relationship between the Marcus mapping and optimal transport. We prove that the Marcus mapping solves a specific type of optimal transport problem and demonstrate that solving this problem through Marcus mapping is more efficient than directly applying optimal transport methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Wang, Tan Rui Yang, Usman Naseem, Roy Ka-Wei Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Hate speech is a pressing issue in modern society, with significant effects both online and offline. Recent research in hate speech detection has primarily centered on text-based media, largely overlooking multimodal content such as videos. Existing studies on hateful video datasets have predominantly focused on English content within a Western context and have been limited to binary labels (hateful or non-hateful), lacking detailed contextual information. This study presents MultiHateClip1 , an novel multilingual dataset created through hate lexicons and human annotation. It aims to enhance the detection of hateful videos on platforms such as YouTube and Bilibili, including content in both English and Chinese languages. Comprising 2,000 videos annotated for hatefulness, offensiveness, and normalcy, this dataset provides a cross-cultural perspective on gender-based hate speech. Through a detailed examination of human annotation results, we discuss the differences between Chinese and English hateful videos and underscore the importance of different modalities in hateful and offensive video analysis. Evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification models, such as VLM, GPT-4V and Qwen-VL, on MultiHateClip highlight the existing challenges in accurately distinguishing between hateful and offensive content and the urgent need for models that are both multimodally and culturally nuanced. MultiHateClip represents a foundational advance in enhancing hateful video detection by underscoring the necessity of a multimodal and culturally sensitive approach in combating online hate speech.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiachen Zhu, Jianghao Lin, Xinyi Dai, Bo Chen, Rong Shan, Jieming Zhu, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: We primarily focus on the field of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, which has been actively explored recently and poses a significant challenge in effectively enhancing recommender systems with logical reasoning abilities and open-world knowledge. Current mainstream efforts mainly center around injecting personalized information from recommendation models into LLMs by customizing input templates or aligning representations between semantic and recommendation spaces at the prediction layer. However, they face three significant limitations: (1) LoRA is mostly used as a core component in existing works, but personalization is not well established in LoRA parameters as the LoRA matrix shared by every user may not cater to different users' characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance. (2) Although lifelong personalized behavior sequences are ideal for personalization, their use raises effectiveness and efficiency issues since LLMs require escalating training and inference time to extend text lengths. (3) Existing approaches aren't scalable for large datasets due to training efficiency constraints. Thus, LLMs only see a small fraction of the datasets (e.g., less than 10%) instead of the whole datasets, limiting their exposure to the full training space. To address these problems, we propose RecLoRA. This model incorporates a Personalized LoRA module that maintains independent LoRAs for different users and a Long-Short Modality Retriever that retrieves different history lengths for different modalities, significantly improving performance while adding minimal time cost. Furthermore, we design a Few2Many Learning Strategy, using a conventional recommendation model as a lens to magnify small training spaces to full spaces. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our RecLoRA compared to existing baseline models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyan Liu, Bo Lan, Zhiyuan Hu, Yang Liu, Zhicheng Zhang, Fei Wang, Michael Shieh, Wenmeng Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in stand-alone code tasks like HumanEval and MBPP, but struggle with handling entire code repositories. This challenge has prompted research on enhancing LLM-codebase interaction at a repository scale. Current solutions rely on similarity-based retrieval or manual tools and APIs, each with notable drawbacks. Similarity-based retrieval often has low recall in complex tasks, while manual tools and APIs are typically task-specific and require expert knowledge, reducing their generalizability across diverse code tasks and real-world applications. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce CodexGraph, a system that integrates LLM agents with graph database interfaces extracted from code repositories. By leveraging the structural properties of graph databases and the flexibility of the graph query language, CodexGraph enables the LLM agent to construct and execute queries, allowing for precise, code structure-aware context retrieval and code navigation. We assess CodexGraph using three benchmarks: CrossCodeEval, SWE-bench, and EvoCodeBench. Additionally, we develop five real-world coding applications. With a unified graph database schema, CodexGraph demonstrates competitive performance and potential in both academic and real-world environments, showcasing its versatility and efficacy in software engineering.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Tian, Jingkai Ying, Zhijin Qin, Ye Jin, Xiaoming Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Although the semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding design has shown promising performance in transmitting data of different modalities over physical layer channels, the synchronization and packet-level forward error correction of multimodal semantics have not been well studied. Due to the independent design of semantic encoders, synchronizing multimodal features in both the semantic and time domains is a challenging problem. In this paper, we take the facial video and speech transmission as an example and propose a Synchronous Multimodal Semantic Communication System (SyncSC) with Packet-Level Coding. To achieve semantic and time synchronization, 3D Morphable Mode (3DMM) coefficients and text are transmitted as semantics, and we propose a semantic codec that achieves similar quality of reconstruction and synchronization with lower bandwidth, compared to traditional methods. To protect semantic packets under the erasure channel, we propose a packet-Level Forward Error Correction (FEC) method, called PacSC, that maintains a certain visual quality performance even at high packet loss rates. Particularly, for text packets, a text packet loss concealment module, called TextPC, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is proposed, which significantly improves the performance of traditional FEC methods. The simulation results show that our proposed SyncSC reduce transmission overhead and achieve high-quality synchronous transmission of video and speech over the packet loss network.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Khamassi, Marceau Nahon, Raja Chatila</p>
<p>Abstract: Minimizing negative impacts of Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems on human societies without human supervision requires them to be able to align with human values. However, most current work only addresses this issue from a technical point of view, e.g., improving current methods relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback, neglecting what it means and is required for alignment to occur. Here, we propose to distinguish strong and weak value alignment. Strong alignment requires cognitive abilities (either human-like or different from humans) such as understanding and reasoning about agents' intentions and their ability to causally produce desired effects. We argue that this is required for AI systems like large language models (LLMs) to be able to recognize situations presenting a risk that human values may be flouted. To illustrate this distinction, we present a series of prompts showing ChatGPT's, Gemini's and Copilot's failures to recognize some of these situations. We moreover analyze word embeddings to show that the nearest neighbors of some human values in LLMs differ from humans' semantic representations. We then propose a new thought experiment that we call "the Chinese room with a word transition dictionary", in extension of John Searle's famous proposal. We finally mention current promising research directions towards a weak alignment, which could produce statistically satisfying answers in a number of common situations, however so far without ensuring any truth value.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anh T. V. Dau, Hieu Trung Dao, Anh Tuan Nguyen, Hieu Trung Tran, Phong X. Nguyen, Nghi D. Q. Bui</p>
<p>Abstract: Mainframe operating systems, despite their inception in the 1940s, continue to support critical sectors like finance and government. However, these systems are often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and modernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can understand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce XMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution involves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce high-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this specialized domain. Additionally, we present MainframeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that XMainframe consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, XMainframe achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of XMainframe to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gianluca De Stefano, Lea Sch\"onherr, Giancarlo Pellegrino</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique commonly used to equip models with out of distribution knowledge. This process involves collecting, indexing, retrieving, and providing information to an LLM for generating responses. Despite its growing popularity due to its flexibility and low cost, the security implications of RAG have not been extensively studied. The data for such systems are often collected from public sources, providing an attacker a gateway for indirect prompt injections to manipulate the responses of the model. In this paper, we investigate the security of RAG systems against end-to-end indirect prompt manipulations. First, we review existing RAG framework pipelines, deriving a prototypical architecture and identifying critical parameters. We then examine prior works searching for techniques that attackers can use to perform indirect prompt manipulations. Finally, we implemented Rag 'n Roll, a framework to determine the effectiveness of attacks against end-to-end RAG applications. Our results show that existing attacks are mostly optimized to boost the ranking of malicious documents during the retrieval phase. However, a higher rank does not immediately translate into a reliable attack. Most attacks, against various configurations, settle around a 40% success rate, which could rise to 60% when considering ambiguous answers as successful attacks (those that include the expected benign one as well). Additionally, when using unoptimized documents, attackers deploying two of them (or more) for a target query can achieve similar results as those using optimized ones. Finally, exploration of the configuration space of a RAG showed limited impact in thwarting the attacks, where the most successful combination severely undermines functionality.</p>
