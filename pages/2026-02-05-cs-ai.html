<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik Goh, John Kos, Ashok Goel</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) can struggle with reasoning ability and planning tasks. Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya Basarkar (DK), Benyamin Tabarsi (DK), Tiffany Barnes (DK),  Dongkuan (DK),  Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is a fundamental benchmark for assessing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence and a gateway to applications in education, science, and engineering where reliable symbolic reasoning is essential. Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yinyi Luo, Yiqiao Jin, Weichen Yu, Mengqi Zhang, Srijan Kumar, Xiaoxiao Li, Weijie Xu, Xin Chen, Jindong Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While large language model (LLM) multi-agent systems achieve superior reasoning performance through iterative debate, practical deployment is limited by their high computational cost and error propagation. This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhui Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning in interactive environments is challenging under partial observability: task-critical preconditions (e.g., object locations or container states) may be unknown at decision time, yet grounding them through interaction is costly. Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03975">Adaptive Test-Time Compute Allocation via Learned Heuristics over Categorical Structure</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuhui Qu</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time computation has become a primary driver of progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning, but it is increasingly bottlenecked by expensive verification. In many reasoning systems, a large fraction of verifier calls are spent on redundant or unpromising intermediate hypotheses. We study reasoning under a \emph{verification-cost-limited} setting and ask how verification effort should be allocated across intermediate states. We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty. Unlike solution-level best-of-$N$ or uniform intermediate verification, our method distributes verification where it is most informative. On the \textsc{MATH} benchmark, our approach achieves higher accuracy than best-of-$N$, majority voting, and beam search while using 44\% fewer verifier calls.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zidi Xiong, Shan Chen, Himabindu Lakkaraju</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are increasingly deployed, auditing their chain-of-thought (CoT) traces for safety becomes critical. Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a "free gift" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04003">When AI Persuades: Adversarial Explanation Attacks on Human Trust in AI-Assisted Decision Making</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Shutong Fan, Lan Zhang, Xiaoyong Yuan</p>
<p>Abstract: Most adversarial threats in artificial intelligence target the computational behavior of models rather than the humans who rely on them. Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI. This is the first systematic security study that treats explanations as an adversarial cognitive channel and quantifies their impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04028">Axiomatic Foundations of Counterfactual Explanations</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Leila Amgoud, Martin Cooper</p>
<p>Abstract: Explaining autonomous and intelligent systems is critical in order to improve trust in their decisions. Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.
  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04089">Scaling In-Context Online Learning Capability of LLMs via Cross-Episode Meta-RL</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaofeng Lin, Sirou Zhu, Yilei Chen, Mingyu Chen, Hejian Sang, Ioannis Paschalidis, Zhipeng Wang, Aldo Pacchiano, Xuezhou Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance when all task-relevant information is available upfront, as in static prediction and instruction-following problems. However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin. Scaling experiments further reveal consistent gains with model size, suggesting significant headroom for learn-at-inference-time decision-making agents.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04101">Interfaze: The Future of AI is built on Task-Specific Small Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Harsha Vardhan Khurdula, Vineet Agarwal, Yoeven D Khemlani</p>
<p>Abstract: We present Interfaze, a system that treats modern LLM applications as a problem of building and acting over context, not just picking the right monolithic model. Instead of a single transformer, we combine (i) a stack of heterogeneous DNNs paired with small language models as perception modules for OCR involving complex PDFs, charts and diagrams, and multilingual ASR with (ii) a context-construction layer that crawls, indexes, and parses external sources (web pages, code, PDFs) into compact structured state, and (iii) an action layer that can browse, retrieve, execute code in a sandbox, and drive a headless browser for dynamic web pages. A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response.
  On this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%). We show that most queries are handled primarily by the small-model and tool stack, with the large LLM operating only on distilled context, yielding competitive accuracy while shifting the bulk of computation away from the most expensive and monolithic models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruiting Dai, Zheyu Wang, Haoyu Yang, Yihan Liu, Chengzhi Wang, Zekun Zhang, Zishan Huang, Jiaman Cen, Lisi Mo</p>
<p>Abstract: Data incompleteness severely impedes the reliability of multimodal systems. Existing reconstruction methods face distinct bottlenecks: conventional parametric/generative models are prone to hallucinations due to over-reliance on internal memory, while retrieval-augmented frameworks struggle with retrieval rigidity. Critically, these end-to-end architectures are fundamentally constrained by Semantic-Detail Entanglement -- a structural conflict between logical reasoning and signal synthesis that compromises fidelity. In this paper, we present \textbf{\underline{O}}mni-\textbf{\underline{M}}odality \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration Agent (\textbf{OMG-Agent}), a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from static mapping to a dynamic coarse-to-fine Agentic Workflow. By mimicking a \textit{deliberate-then-act} cognitive process, OMG-Agent explicitly decouples the task into three synergistic stages: (1) an MLLM-driven Semantic Planner that resolves input ambiguity via Progressive Contextual Reasoning, creating a deterministic structured semantic plan; (2) a non-parametric Evidence Retriever that grounds abstract semantics in external knowledge; and (3) a Retrieval-Injected Executor that utilizes retrieved evidence as flexible feature prompts to overcome rigidity and synthesize high-fidelity details. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that OMG-Agent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, maintaining robustness under extreme missingness, e.g., a $2.6$-point gain on CMU-MOSI at $70$\% missing rates.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Enyu Zhou, Zhiheng Xi, Long Ma, Zhihao Zhang, Shihan Dou, Zhikai Lei, Guoteng Wang, Rui Zheng, Hang Yan, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Feiyu Gavin Zhu, Jean Oh, Reid Simmons</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning has shown success in many tasks by learning from expert demonstrations. However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop. This shows that our method is more suitable for end-users without much technical background in machine learning to train a dependable policy</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Lu, Haoyuan Huang, Yulin Zhou, Chen Li, Ningxin Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Inference-time scaling strategies, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yansong Ning, Jun Fang, Naiqiang Tan, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Managing agent thought and observation during multi-turn agent-environment interactions is an emerging strategy to improve agent efficiency. However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04326">From Assumptions to Actions: Turning LLM Reasoning into Uncertainty-Aware Planning for Embodied Agents</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> SeungWon Seo, SooBin Lim, SeongRae Noh, Haneul Kim, HyeongYeop Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marco Picone, Fabio Turazza, Matteo Martinelli, Marco Mamei</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), particularly in the industrial domain, has amplified the challenges associated with the effective integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Fragmentation across IoT and IIoT technologies, manifested through diverse communication protocols, data formats and device capabilities, creates a substantial gap between low-level physical layers and high-level intelligent functionalities. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering structured, interoperable and semantically rich digital representations of physical assets. Current approaches are often siloed and tightly coupled, limiting scalability and reuse of AI functionalities. This work proposes a modular and interoperable solution that enables seamless AI pipeline integration into CPS by minimizing configuration and decoupling the roles of DTs and AI components. We introduce the concept of Zero Configuration (ZeroConf) AI pipelines, where DTs orchestrate data management and intelligent augmentation. The approach is demonstrated in a MicroFactory scenario, showing support for concurrent ML models and dynamic data processing, effectively accelerating the deployment of intelligent services in complex industrial settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: Expert-level scientific reasoning remains challenging for large language models, particularly on benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), where rigid tool pipelines, brittle multi-agent coordination, and inefficient test-time scaling often limit performance. We introduce ReThinker, a confidence-aware agentic framework that orchestrates retrieval, tool use, and multi-agent reasoning through a stage-wise Solver-Critic-Selector architecture. Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision. Experiments on HLE, GAIA, and XBench demonstrate that ReThinker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models with tools and existing deep research systems, achieving state-of-the-art results on expert-level reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Niv Fono, Yftah Ziser, Omer Ben-Porat</p>
<p>Abstract: While Generative AI (GenAI) systems draw users away from (Q&A) forums, they also depend on the very data those forums produce to improve their performance. Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaheng Liu, Yuanxing Zhang, Shihao Li, Xinping Lei</p>
<p>Abstract: For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.
  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zelai Xu, Zhexuan Xu, Ruize Zhang, Chunyang Zhu, Shi Yu, Weilin Liu, Quanlu Zhang, Wenbo Ding, Chao Yu, Yu Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Vatsal, Harsh Dubey, Aditi Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents that plan, use tools and act has begun to shape healthcare and medicine. Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haosen Ge, Hamsa Bastani, Osbert Bastani</p>
<p>Abstract: Rapidly increasing AI capabilities have substantial real-world consequences, ranging from AI safety concerns to labor market consequences. The Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) report argues that AI capabilities have exhibited exponential growth since 2019. In this note, we argue that the data does not support exponential growth, even in shorter-term horizons. Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed. In addition, we propose a more complex model that decomposes AI capabilities into base and reasoning capabilities, exhibiting individual rates of improvement. We prove that this model supports our hypothesis that AI capabilities will exhibit an inflection point in the near future. Our goal is not to establish a rigorous forecast of our own, but to highlight the fragility of existing forecasts of exponential growth.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaotian Weng, Antonis Antoniades, Deepak Nathani, Zhen Zhang, Xiao Pu, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-ended self-improving agents can autonomously modify their own structural designs to advance their capabilities and overcome the limits of pre-defined architectures, thus reducing reliance on human intervention. We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dmitrii Kharlapenko, Alessandro Stolfo, Arthur Conmy, Mrinmaya Sachan, Zhijing Jin</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning language models, which generate long chains of thought, dramatically outperform non-reasoning language models on abstract problems. However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss. We find that one of the factors driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations, which we dub Fluid Reasoning Representations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mai H. Nguyen, Shibani Likhite, Jiawei Tang, Darshini Mahendran, Bridget T. McInnes</p>
<p>Abstract: The extraction of chemical-gene relations plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate interactions between chemical compounds and genes, with significant implications for drug discovery, disease understanding, and biomedical research. This paper presents a data set created by merging the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets to augment sample counts and improve model accuracy. We evaluate the merged dataset using two state of the art relationship extraction algorithms: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) specifically BioBERT, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) combined with BioBERT. While BioBERT excels at capturing local contexts, it may benefit from incorporating global information essential for understanding chemical-gene interactions. This can be achieved by integrating GCNs with BioBERT to harness both global and local context. Our results show that by integrating the ChemProt and DrugProt datasets, we demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, particularly in CPR groups shared between the datasets. Incorporating the global context using GCN can help increase the overall precision and recall in some of the CPR groups over using just BioBERT.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keyu Zhao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li, Tie-Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The "AI Scientist" paradigm is transforming scientific research by automating key stages of the research process, from idea generation to scholarly writing. This shift is expected to accelerate discovery and expand the scope of scientific inquiry. However, a key question remains unclear: can AI scientists identify meaningful research questions? While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied successfully to task-specific ideation, their potential to conduct strategic, long-term assessments of past breakthroughs and future questions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore a human-AI hybrid solution that integrates the scalable data processing capabilities of AI with the value judgment of human experts. Our methodology is structured in three phases. The first phase, AI-Accelerated Information Gathering, leverages AI's advantage in processing vast amounts of literature to generate a hybrid information base. The second phase, Candidate Question Proposing, utilizes this synthesized data to prompt an ensemble of six diverse LLMs to propose an initial candidate pool, filtered via a cross-model voting mechanism. The third phase, Hybrid Question Selection, refines this pool through a multi-stage filtering process that progressively increases human oversight. To validate this system, we conducted an experiment aiming to identify the Top 10 Scientific Breakthroughs of 2025 and the Top 10 Scientific Questions for 2026 across five major disciplines. Our analysis reveals that while AI agents demonstrate high alignment with human experts in recognizing established breakthroughs, they exhibit greater divergence in forecasting prospective questions, suggesting that human judgment remains crucial for evaluating subjective, forward-looking challenges.</p>

We then propose a violation-conditioned VLM that additionally conditions on the WCAG2 violation count to guide the correction process.

<p>Abstract: The mental well-being of graduate students is an increasing concern, yet the adoption of scalable support remains uneven. Artificial intelligence-powered cognitive behavioral therapy chatbots (AI-CBT) offer low barrier help, but little is known about how Chinese postgraduates perceive and use them. This qualitative study explored perceptions and experiences of AI-CBT chatbots among ten Chinese graduate students recruited through social media. Semi-structured Zoom interviews were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, with the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as sensitizing frameworks. The findings indicate a cautious openness to AI-CBT chatbots: perceived usefulness and 24/7 access supported favorable attitudes, while data privacy, emotional safety, and uncertainty about `fit' for complex problems restricted the intention to use. Social norms (e.g., stigma and peer views) and perceived control (digital literacy, language quality) further shaped adoption. The study offers context-specific information to guide the culturally sensitive design, communication, and deployment of AI mental well-being tools for student populations in China and outlines the design implications around transparency, safeguards, and graduated care pathways.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chandrashekar M S, Vineet Singh, Lakshmi Pedapudi</p>
<p>Abstract: The digitization of agricultural advisory services in India requires robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems capable of accurately transcribing domain-specific terminology in multiple Indian languages. This paper presents a benchmarking framework for evaluating ASR performance in agricultural contexts across Hindi, Telugu, and Odia languages. We introduce evaluation metrics including Agriculture Weighted Word Error Rate (AWWER) and domain-specific utility scoring to complement traditional metrics. Our evaluation of 10,934 audio recordings, each transcribed by up to 10 ASR models, reveals performance variations across languages and models, with Hindi achieving the best overall performance (WER: 16.2%) while Odia presents the greatest challenges (best WER: 35.1%, achieved only with speaker diarization). We characterize audio quality challenges inherent to real-world agricultural field recordings and demonstrate that speaker diarization with best-speaker selection can substantially reduce WER for multi-speaker recordings (upto 66% depending on the proportion of multi-speaker audio). We identify recurring error patterns in agricultural terminology and provide practical recommendations for improving ASR systems in low-resource agricultural domains. The study establishes baseline benchmarks for future agricultural ASR development.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaming Zhang, Huanyi Xie, Meng Ding, Shaopeng Fu, Jinyan Liu, Di Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research shows that modern deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy partly by memorizing individual training samples. Such memorization raises serious privacy concerns, motivating the widespread adoption of differentially private training algorithms such as DP-SGD. However, a growing body of empirical work shows that DP-SGD often leads to suboptimal generalization performance, particularly on long-tailed data that contain a large number of rare or atypical samples. Despite these observations, a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, and existing differential privacy analysis are difficult to extend to the nonconvex and nonsmooth neural networks commonly used in practice. In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for analyzing DP-SGD on long-tailed data from a feature learning perspective. We show that the test error of DP-SGD-trained models on the long-tailed subpopulation is significantly larger than the overall test error over the entire dataset. Our analysis further characterizes the training dynamics of DP-SGD, demonstrating how gradient clipping and noise injection jointly adversely affect the model's ability to memorize informative but underrepresented samples. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Jia, Weibin Li, Jingyao Wu, Xiaofeng Yu, Yan Gao, Jintao Cheng, Xiaoyu Tang, Feng Xia, Ting Dang</p>
<p>Abstract: Emotion recognition from human speech is a critical enabler for socially aware conversational AI. However, while most prior work frames emotion recognition as a categorical classification problem, real-world affective states are often ambiguous, overlapping, and context-dependent, posing significant challenges for both annotation and automatic modeling. Recent large-scale audio language models (ALMs) offer new opportunities for nuanced affective reasoning without explicit emotion supervision, but their capacity to handle ambiguous emotions remains underexplored. At the same time, advances in inference-time techniques such as test-time scaling (TTS) have shown promise for improving generalization and adaptability in hard NLP tasks, but their relevance to affective computing is still largely unknown. In this work, we introduce the first benchmark for ambiguous emotion recognition in speech with ALMs under test-time scaling. Our evaluation systematically compares eight state-of-the-art ALMs and five TTS strategies across three prominent speech emotion datasets. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the interaction between model capacity, TTS, and affective ambiguity, offering new insights into the computational and representational challenges of ambiguous emotion understanding. Our benchmark establishes a foundation for developing more robust, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent speech-based AI systems, and highlights key future directions for bridging the gap between model assumptions and the complexity of real-world human emotion.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.</p>

<p>Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) trains a reward model on pairwise preference data and then uses it for policy optimization. However, while reward models are optimized to capture relative preferences, existing policy optimization techniques rely on absolute reward magnitudes during training. In settings where the rewards are non-verifiable such as summarization, instruction following, and chat completion, this misalignment often leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Group Ordinal Policy Optimization (GOPO), a policy optimization method that uses only the ranking of the rewards and discards their magnitudes. Our rank-based transformation of rewards provides several gains, compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), in settings with non-verifiable rewards: (1) consistently higher training/validation reward trajectories, (2) improved LLM-as-judge evaluations across most intermediate training steps, and (3) reaching a policy of comparable quality in substantially less training steps than GRPO. We demonstrate consistent improvements across a range of tasks and model sizes.</p>

<p>Abstract: To address the trade-off between computational efficiency and adherence to Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles, we propose TruKAN, a new architecture based on the KAN structure and learnable activation functions. TruKAN replaces the B-spline basis in KAN with a family of truncated power functions derived from k-order spline theory. This change maintains the KAN's expressiveness while enhancing accuracy and training time. Each TruKAN layer combines a truncated power term with a polynomial term and employs either shared or individual knots. TruKAN exhibits greater interpretability than other KAN variants due to its simplified basis functions and knot configurations. By prioritizing interpretable basis functions, TruKAN aims to balance approximation efficacy with transparency. We develop the TruKAN model and integrate it into an advanced EfficientNet-V2-based framework, which is then evaluated on computer vision benchmark datasets. To ensure a fair comparison, we develop various models: MLP-, KAN-, SineKAN and TruKAN-based EfficientNet frameworks and assess their training time and accuracy across small and deep architectures. The training phase uses hybrid optimization to improve convergence stability. Additionally, we investigate layer normalization techniques for all the models and assess the impact of shared versus individual knots in TruKAN. Overall, TruKAN outperforms other KAN models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and memory usage on the complex vision task, demonstrating advantages beyond the limited settings explored in prior KAN studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maxx Richard Rahman, Mostafa Hammouda, Wolfgang Maass</p>
<p>Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a major challenge due to the subtle and temporally irregular progression of structural brain changes in the prodromal stages. Existing deep learning approaches require large longitudinal datasets and often fail to model the temporal continuity and modality irregularities inherent in real-world clinical data. To address these limitations, we propose the Diffusion-Guided Attention Network (DiGAN), which integrates latent diffusion modelling with an attention-guided convolutional network. The diffusion model synthesizes realistic longitudinal neuroimaging trajectories from limited training data, enriching temporal context and improving robustness to unevenly spaced visits. The attention-convolutional layer then captures discriminative structural--temporal patterns that distinguish cognitively normal subjects from those with mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Experiments on synthetic and ADNI datasets demonstrate that DiGAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing its potential for early-stage AD detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haijiang Yan, Nick Chater, Adam Sanborn</p>
<p>Abstract: Incorporating individual-level cognitive priors offers an important route to personalizing neural networks, yet accurately eliciting such priors remains challenging: existing methods either fail to uniquely identify them or introduce systematic biases. Here, we introduce PriorProbe, a novel elicitation approach grounded in Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People that recovers fine-grained, individual-specific priors. Focusing on a facial expression recognition task, we apply PriorProbe to individual participants and test whether integrating the recovered priors with a state-of-the-art neural network improves its ability to predict an individual's classification on ambiguous stimuli. The PriorProbe-derived priors yield substantial performance gains, outperforming both the neural network alone and alternative sources of priors, while preserving the network's inference on ground-truth labels. Together, these results demonstrate that PriorProbe provides a general and interpretable framework for personalizing deep neural networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akshansh Mishra, Rakesh Morisetty</p>
<p>Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Seohyun Joo, Yoori Oh</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-visual video highlight detection aims to automatically identify the most salient moments in videos by leveraging both visual and auditory cues. However, existing models often underutilize the audio modality, focusing on high-level semantic features while failing to fully leverage the rich, dynamic characteristics of sound. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Dual-Pathway Audio Encoders for Video Highlight Detection (DAViHD). The dual-pathway audio encoder is composed of a semantic pathway for content understanding and a dynamic pathway that captures spectro-temporal dynamics. The semantic pathway extracts high-level information by identifying the content within the audio, such as speech, music, or specific sound events. The dynamic pathway employs a frequency-adaptive mechanism as time evolves to jointly model these dynamics, enabling it to identify transient acoustic events via salient spectral bands and rapid energy changes. We integrate the novel audio encoder into a full audio-visual framework and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Mr.HiSum benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a sophisticated, dual-faceted audio representation is key to advancing the field of highlight detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinxing Zhou, Yanghao Zhou, Yaoting Wang, Zongyan Han, Jiaqi Ma, Henghui Ding, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal</p>
<p>Abstract: Language-referred audio-visual segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects described by natural language by jointly reasoning over video, audio, and text. Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugo Markoff, Stefan Hein Bengtson, Michael {\O}rsted</p>
<p>Abstract: Manual labeling of animal images remains a significant bottleneck in ecological research, limiting the scale and efficiency of biodiversity monitoring efforts. This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences. We introduce an open-source benchmarking toolkit and provide recommendations for ecologists to select appropriate methods for sorting their specific taxonomic groups and data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilles Bareilles, Wassim Bouaziz, Julien Fageot, El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Aggregation rules are the cornerstone of distributed (or federated) learning in the presence of adversaries, under the so-called Byzantine threat model. They are also interesting mathematical objects from the point of view of robust mean estimation. The Krum aggregation rule has been extensively studied, and endowed with formal robustness and convergence guarantees. Yet, MultiKrum, a natural extension of Krum, is often preferred in practice for its superior empirical performance, even though no theoretical guarantees were available until now. In this work, we provide the first proof that MultiKrum is a robust aggregation rule, and bound its robustness coefficient. To do so, we introduce $\kappa^\star$, the optimal *robustness coefficient* of an aggregation rule, which quantifies the accuracy of mean estimation in the presence of adversaries in a tighter manner compared with previously adopted notions of robustness. We then construct an upper and a lower bound on MultiKrum's robustness coefficient. As a by-product, we also improve on the best-known bounds on Krum's robustness coefficient. We show that MultiKrum's bounds are never worse than Krum's, and better in realistic regimes. We illustrate this analysis by an experimental investigation on the quality of the lower bound.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiying Zhang, Shuhao Zhang, Pierre Vandergheynst, Patrick Barth</p>
<p>Abstract: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), primary targets for over one-third of approved therapeutics, rely on intricate conformational transitions to transduce signals. While Molecular Dynamics (MD) is essential for elucidating this transduction process, particularly within ligand-bound complexes, conventional all-atom MD simulation is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce GPCRLMD, a deep generative framework for efficient all-atom GPCR-ligand simulation.GPCRLMD employs a Harmonic-Prior Variational Autoencoder (HP-VAE) to first map the complex into a regularized isometric latent space, preserving geometric topology via physics-informed constraints. Within this latent space, a Residual Latent Flow samples evolution trajectories, which are subsequently decoded back to atomic coordinates. By capturing temporal dynamics via relative displacements anchored to the initial structure, this residual mechanism effectively decouples static topology from dynamic fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that GPCRLMD achieves state-of-the-art performance in GPCR-ligand dynamics simulation, faithfully reproducing thermodynamic observables and critical ligand-receptor interactions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weiqi Wang, Zhiyi Tian, Chenhan Zhang, Shui Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is widely used, but in deep learning, it is usually implemented through tractable surrogates, such as variational bounds or neural mutual information (MI) estimators, rather than directly controlling the MI I(X;Z) itself. The looseness and estimator-dependent bias can make IB "compression" only indirectly controlled and optimization fragile.
  We revisit the IB problem through the lens of information geometry and propose a \textbf{Geo}metric \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}ottleneck (\textbf{GeoIB}) that dispenses with mutual information (MI) estimation. We show that I(X;Z) and I(Z;Y) admit exact projection forms as minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances from the joint distributions to their respective independence manifolds. Guided by this view, GeoIB controls information compression with two complementary terms: (i) a distribution-level Fisher-Rao (FR) discrepancy, which matches KL to second order and is reparameterization-invariant; and (ii) a geometry-level Jacobian-Frobenius (JF) term that provides a local capacity-type upper bound on I(Z;X) by penalizing pullback volume expansion of the encoder. We further derive a natural-gradient optimizer consistent with the FR metric and prove that the standard additive natural-gradient step is first-order equivalent to the geodesic update. We conducted extensive experiments and observed that the GeoIB achieves a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane than the mainstream IB baselines on popular datasets. GeoIB improves invariance and optimization stability by unifying distributional and geometric regularization under a single bottleneck multiplier.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qiuming Luo, Tao Zeng, Feng Li, Heming Liu, Rui Mao, Chang Kong</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples.</p>

<p>Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable sparse expert activation, meaning that only a subset of the model's parameters is used during each inference. However, to translate this sparsity into practical performance, an expert caching mechanism is required. Previous works have proposed hardware-centric caching policies, but how these various caching policies interact with each other and different hardware specification remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{SpecMD}, a standardized framework for benchmarking ad-hoc cache policies on various hardware configurations. Using SpecMD, we perform an exhaustive benchmarking of several MoE caching strategies, reproducing and extending prior approaches in controlled settings with realistic constraints. Our experiments reveal that MoE expert access is not consistent with temporal locality assumptions (e.g LRU, LFU). Motivated by this observation, we propose \textbf{Least-Stale}, a novel eviction policy that exploits MoE's predictable expert access patterns to reduce collision misses by up to $85\times$ over LRU. With such gains, we achieve over $88\%$ hit rates with up to $34.7\%$ Time-to-first-token (TTFT) reduction on OLMoE at only $5\%$ or $0.6GB$ of VRAM cache capacity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Aich, Andreas F\"urst, Florian Sestak, Carlos Ruiz-Gonzalez, Niklas Boers, Johannes Brandstetter</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized weather and climate modeling, yet the current landscape remains fragmented: highly specialized models are typically trained individually for distinct tasks. To unify this landscape, we introduce WIND, a single pre-trained foundation model capable of replacing specialized baselines across a vast array of tasks. Crucially, in contrast to previous atmospheric foundation models, we achieve this without any task-specific fine-tuning. To learn a robust, task-agnostic prior of the atmosphere, we pre-train WIND with a self-supervised video reconstruction objective, utilizing an unconditional video diffusion model to iteratively reconstruct atmospheric dynamics from a noisy state. At inference, we frame diverse domain-specific problems strictly as inverse problems and solve them via posterior sampling. This unified approach allows us to tackle highly relevant weather and climate problems, including probabilistic forecasting, spatial and temporal downscaling, sparse reconstruction and enforcing conservation laws purely with our pre-trained model. We further demonstrate the model's capacity to generate physically consistent counterfactual storylines of extreme weather events under global warming scenarios. By combining generative video modeling with inverse problem solving, WIND offers a computationally efficient paradigm shift in AI-based atmospheric modeling.</p>

<p>Abstract: Extracting medical decisions from clinical notes is a key step for clinical decision support and patient-facing care summaries. We study how the linguistic characteristics of clinical decisions vary across decision categories and whether these differences explain extraction failures. Using MedDec discharge summaries annotated with decision categories from the Decision Identification and Classification Taxonomy for Use in Medicine (DICTUM), we compute seven linguistic indices for each decision span and analyze span-level extraction recall of a standard transformer model. We find clear category-specific signatures: drug-related and problem-defining decisions are entity-dense and telegraphic, whereas advice and precaution decisions contain more narrative, with higher stopword and pronoun proportions and more frequent hedging and negation cues. On the validation split, exact-match recall is 48%, with large gaps across linguistic strata: recall drops from 58% to 24% from the lowest to highest stopword-proportion bins, and spans containing hedging or negation cues are less likely to be recovered. Under a relaxed overlap-based match criterion, recall increases to 71%, indicating that many errors are span boundary disagreements rather than complete misses. Overall, narrative-style spans--common in advice and precaution decisions--are a consistent blind spot under exact matching, suggesting that downstream systems should incorporate boundary-tolerant evaluation and extraction strategies for clinical decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study strategic Gaussian semantic compression under rate and compute constraints, where an encoder and decoder optimize distinct quadratic objectives. A latent Gaussian state generates a task dependent semantic variable, and the decoder best responds via MMSE estimation, reducing the encoder's problem to posterior covariance design under an information rate constraint. We characterize the strategic rate distortion function in direct, remote, and full information regimes, derive semantic waterfilling and rate constrained Gaussian persuasion solutions, and establish Gaussian optimality under misaligned objectives. We further show that architectural compute limits act as implicit rate constraints, yielding exponential improvements in semantic accuracy with model depth and inference time compute, while multimodal observation eliminates the geometric mean penalty inherent to remote encoding. These results provide information theoretic foundations for data and energy efficient AI and offer a principled interpretation of modern multimodal language models as posterior design mechanisms under resource constraints.</p>

<p>Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) represents a significant technological shift within the scientific ecosystem, particularly within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper examines structural changes in the AI research landscape using a dataset of arXiv preprints (cs.AI) from 2021 through 2025. Given the rapid pace of AI development, the preprint ecosystem has become a critical barometer for real-time scientific shifts, often preceding formal peer-reviewed publication by months or years. By employing a multi-stage data collection and enrichment pipeline in conjunction with LLM-based institution classification, we analyze the evolution of publication volumes, author team sizes, and academic--industry collaboration patterns. Our results reveal an unprecedented surge in publication output following the introduction of ChatGPT, with academic institutions continuing to provide the largest volume of research. However, we observe that academic--industry collaboration is still suppressed, as measured by a Normalized Collaboration Index (NCI) that remains significantly below the random-mixing baseline across all major subfields. These findings highlight a continuing institutional divide and suggest that the capital-intensive nature of generative AI research may be reshaping the boundaries of scientific collaboration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kapilan Balagopalan, Yinan Li, Yao Zhao, Tuan Nguyen, Anton Daitche, Houssam Nassif, Kwang-Sung Jun</p>
<p>Abstract: The best-arm identification (BAI) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in interactive machine learning, which has two flavors: the fixed-budget setting (FB) and the fixed-confidence setting (FC).
  For $K$-armed bandits with the unique best arm, the optimal sample complexities for both settings have been settled down, and they match up to logarithmic factors.
  This prompts an interesting research question about the generic, potentially structured BAI problems: Is FB harder than FC or the other way around?
  In this paper, we show that FB is no harder than FC up to logarithmic factors.
  We do this constructively: we propose a novel algorithm called FC2FB (fixed confidence to fixed budget), which is a meta algorithm that takes in an FC algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ and turn it into an FB algorithm.
  We prove that this FC2FB enjoys a sample complexity that matches, up to logarithmic factors, that of the sample complexity of $\mathcal{A}$.
  This means that the optimal FC sample complexity is an upper bound of the optimal FB sample complexity up to logarithmic factors.
  Our result not only reveals a fundamental relationship between FB and FC, but also has a significant implication: FC2FB, combined with existing state-of-the-art FC algorithms, leads to improved sample complexity for a number of FB problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vsevolod Kapatsinski</p>
<p>Abstract: Because language is creative, any reasonable language model must generalize, deciding what to say in novel contexts by using information from similar contexts. But what about contexts that are not novel but merely infrequent? In hierarchical regression, the model's predictions for behavior in a context are affected by observations from other similar contexts to the extent that 1) the current context is infrequent and 2) different contexts behave similarly. This is called adaptive partial pooling of evidence. This paper shows that next-word predictions of a transformer (GPT2) are increasingly unaffected by observations from outside the current context across epochs of training (the amount of pooling reduces with training), and that the extent of pooling is affected by context frequency, context number (type frequency) and context variability in a similar way to hierarchical regression. These characteristics of learning in transformers are argued to be realistic on both rational and empirical grounds.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aijie Shu, Wenbin Wu, Gbenga Ibikunle, Fengxiang He</p>
<p>Abstract: Credit exposure in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is often implicit and token-mediated, creating a dense web of inter-protocol dependencies. Thus, a shock to one token may result in significant and uncontrolled contagion effects. As the DeFi ecosystem becomes increasingly linked with traditional financial infrastructure through instruments, such as stablecoins, the risk posed by this dynamic demands more powerful quantification tools. We introduce DeXposure-FM, the first time-series, graph foundation model for measuring and forecasting inter-protocol credit exposure on DeFi networks, to the best of our knowledge. Employing a graph-tabular encoder, with pre-trained weight initialization, and multiple task-specific heads, DeXposure-FM is trained on the DeXposure dataset that has 43.7 million data entries, across 4,300+ protocols on 602 blockchains, covering 24,300+ unique tokens. The training is operationalized for credit-exposure forecasting, predicting the joint dynamics of (1) protocol-level flows, and (2) the topology and weights of credit-exposure links. The DeXposure-FM is empirically validated on two machine learning benchmarks; it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including a graph foundation model and temporal graph neural networks. DeXposure-FM further produces financial economics tools that support macroprudential monitoring and scenario-based DeFi stress testing, by enabling protocol-level systemic-importance scores, sector-level spillover and concentration measures via a forecast-then-measure pipeline. Empirical verification fully supports our financial economics tools. The model and code have been publicly available. Model: https://huggingface.co/EVIEHub/DeXposure-FM.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anish Sathyanarayanan, Aditya Nagarsekar, Aarush Rathore</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is widely assumed to expose a model's reasoning process and improve transparency. We attempted to enforce this assumption by penalizing unfaithful reasoning, but found that surface-level compliance does not guarantee causal reliance. Our central finding is negative: even when CoT is verbose, strategic, and flagged by surface-level manipulation detectors, model answers are often causally independent of the CoT content. We present a diagnostic framework for auditing this failure mode: it combines (i) an interpretable behavioral module that scores manipulation-relevant signals in CoT text and (ii) a causal probe that measures CoT-mediated influence (CMI) via hidden-state patching and reports a bypass score ($1-\mathrm{CMI}$), quantifying the degree to which the answer is produced by a bypass circuit independent of the rationale. In pilot evaluations, audit-aware prompting increases detectable manipulation signals (mean risk-score delta: $+5.10$), yet causal probes reveal task-dependent mediation: many QA items exhibit near-total bypass (CMI $\approx 0$), while some logic problems show stronger mediation (CMI up to $0.56$). Layer-wise analysis reveals narrow and task-dependent ``reasoning windows'' even when mean CMI is low.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jusheng Zhang, Ningyuan Liu, Qinhan Lyu, Jing Yang, Keze Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep neural networks typically treat nonlinearities as fixed primitives (e.g., ReLU), limiting both interpretability and the granularity of control over the induced function class. While recent additive models (like KANs) attempt to address this using splines, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and boundary instability. We propose the Rational-ANOVA Network (RAN), a foundational architecture grounded in functional ANOVA decomposition and Pad\'e-style rational approximation. RAN models f(x) as a composition of main effects and sparse pairwise interactions, where each component is parameterized by a stable, learnable rational unit. Crucially, we enforce a strictly positive denominator, which avoids poles and numerical instability while capturing sharp transitions and near-singular behaviors more efficiently than polynomial bases. This ANOVA structure provides an explicit low-order interaction bias for data efficiency and interpretability, while the rational parameterization significantly improves extrapolation. Across controlled function benchmarks and vision classification tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10) under matched parameter and compute budgets, RAN matches or surpasses parameter-matched MLPs and learnable-activation baselines, with better stability and throughput.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehdi Lotfian, Mohammad Jalali, Farzan Farnia</p>
<p>Abstract: Prompt-guided generative AI models have rapidly expanded across vision and language domains, producing realistic and diverse outputs from textual inputs. The growing variety of such models, trained with different data and architectures, calls for principled methods to identify which types of prompts lead to distinct model behaviors. In this work, we propose PromptSplit, a kernel-based framework for detecting and analyzing prompt-dependent disagreement between generative models. For each compared model pair, PromptSplit constructs a joint prompt--output representation by forming tensor-product embeddings of the prompt and image (or text) features, and then computes the corresponding kernel covariance matrix. We utilize the eigenspace of the weighted difference between these matrices to identify the main directions of behavioral difference across prompts. To ensure scalability, we employ a random-projection approximation that reduces computational complexity to $O(nr^2 + r^3)$ for projection dimension $r$. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that this approximation yields an eigenstructure estimate whose expected deviation from the full-dimensional result is bounded by $O(1/r^2)$. Experiments across text-to-image, text-to-text, and image-captioning settings demonstrate that PromptSplit accurately detects ground-truth behavioral differences and isolates the prompts responsible, offering an interpretable tool for detecting where generative models disagree.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04019">Understanding and Guiding Layer Placement in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichen Xu, Yuyang Liang, Shan Dai, Tianyang Hu, Tsz Nam Chan, Chenhao Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow, the cost of full-parameter fine-tuning has made parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) the default strategy for downstream adaptation. Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost. Moreover, on Qwen3-8B, we show that selectively adapting a subset of layers can achieve performance close to full-layer LoRA while substantially reducing fine-tuning cost and the number of adapter-augmented layers during inference, offering a more cost-performance-aware alternative to full-layer insertion.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vignesh Kothapalli, Rishabh Ranjan, Valter Hudovernik, Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Johannes Hoffart, Carlos Guestrin, Jure Leskovec</p>
<p>Abstract: Relational Foundation Models (RFMs) facilitate data-driven decision-making by learning from complex multi-table databases. However, the diverse relational databases needed to train such models are rarely public due to privacy constraints. While there are methods to generate synthetic tabular data of arbitrary size, incorporating schema structure and primary--foreign key connectivity for multi-table generation remains challenging. Here we introduce PluRel, a framework to synthesize multi-tabular relational databases from scratch. In a step-by-step fashion, PluRel models (1) schemas with directed graphs, (2) inter-table primary-foreign key connectivity with bipartite graphs, and, (3) feature distributions in tables via conditional causal mechanisms. The design space across these stages supports the synthesis of a wide range of diverse databases, while being computationally lightweight. Using PluRel, we observe for the first time that (1) RFM pretraining loss exhibits power-law scaling with the number of synthetic databases and total pretraining tokens, (2) scaling the number of synthetic databases improves generalization to real databases, and (3) synthetic pretraining yields strong base models for continued pretraining on real databases. Overall, our framework and results position synthetic data scaling as a promising paradigm for RFMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jind\v{r}ich Libovick\'y</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent studies evaluate the value orientation of large language models (LLMs) using adapted social surveys, typically by prompting models with survey questions and comparing their responses to average human responses. This paper identifies limitations in this methodology that, depending on the exact setup, can lead to both underestimating and overestimating the similarity of value orientation. Using the World Value Survey in three languages across five countries, we demonstrate that prompting methods (direct vs. chain-of-thought) and decoding strategies (greedy vs. sampling) significantly affect results. To assess the interaction between answers, we introduce a novel metric, self-correlation distance. This metric measures whether LLMs maintain consistent relationships between answers across different questions, as humans do. This indicates that even a high average agreement with human data, when considering LLM responses independently, does not guarantee structural alignment in responses. Additionally, we reveal a weak correlation between two common evaluation metrics, mean-squared distance and KL divergence, which assume that survey answers are independent of each other. For future research, we recommend CoT prompting, sampling-based decoding with dozens of samples, and robust analysis using multiple metrics, including self-correlation distance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> R\'ois\'in Luo</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, significantly expanding the frontiers of what is achievable in artificial intelligence. Yet, despite these advances, critical challenges remain -- most notably, ensuring robustness to small input perturbations and generalization to out-of-distribution data. These critical challenges underscore the need to understand the underlying fundamental principles that govern robustness and generalization. Among the theoretical tools available, Lipschitz continuity plays a pivotal role in governing the fundamental properties of neural networks related to robustness and generalization. It quantifies the worst-case sensitivity of network's outputs to small input perturbations. While its importance is widely acknowledged, prior research has predominantly focused on empirical regularization approaches based on Lipschitz constraints, leaving the underlying principles less explored. This thesis seeks to advance a principled understanding of the principles of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks within the paradigm of machine learning, examined from two complementary perspectives: an internal perspective -- focusing on the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during training (i.e., training dynamics); and an external perspective -- investigating how Lipschitz continuity modulates the behavior of neural networks with respect to features in the input data, particularly its role in governing frequency signal propagation (i.e., modulation of frequency signal propagation).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexandre Barbosa de Lima</p>
<p>Abstract: Channel estimation in wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems faces fundamental pilot overhead limitations in high-dimensional beyond-5G and sixth-generation (6G) scenarios. This paper presents a hybrid tensor-neural architecture that formulates pilot-limited channel estimation as low-rank tensor completion from sparse observations -- a fundamentally different setting from prior tensor methods that assume fully observed received signal tensors. A canonical polyadic (CP) baseline implemented via a projection-based scheme (Tucker completion under partial observations) and Tucker decompositions are compared under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and scattering conditions: CP performs well for specular channels matching the multipath model, while Tucker provides greater robustness under model mismatch. A lightweight three-dimensional (3D) U-Net learns residual components beyond the low-rank structure, bridging algebraic models and realistic propagation effects. Empirical recovery threshold analysis shows that sample complexity scales approximately with intrinsic model dimensionality $L(N_r + N_t + N_f)$ rather than ambient tensor size $N_r N_t N_f$, where $L$ denotes the number of dominant propagation paths. Experiments on synthetic channels demonstrate 10-20\,dB normalized mean-square error (NMSE) improvement over least-squares (LS) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) baselines at 5-10\% pilot density, while evaluations on DeepMIMO ray-tracing channels show 24-44\% additional NMSE reduction over pure tensor-based methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: A number of studies have concluded that dreaming is mostly caused by randomly arriving internal signals because "dream contents are random impulses", and argued that dream sleep is unlikely to play an important part in our intellectual capacity. On the contrary, numerous functional studies have revealed that dream sleep does play an important role in our learning and other intellectual functions. Specifically, recent studies have suggested the importance of dream sleep in memory consolidation, following the findings of neural replaying of recent waking patterns in the hippocampus. The randomness has been the hurdle that divides dream theories into either functional or functionless. This study presents a cognitive and computational model of dream process. This model is simulated to perform the functions of learning and memory consolidation, which are two most popular dream functions that have been proposed. The simulations demonstrate that random signals may result in learning and memory consolidation. Thus, dreaming is proposed as a continuation of brain's waking activities that processes signals activated spontaneously and randomly from the hippocampus. The characteristics of the model are discussed and found in agreement with many characteristics concluded from various empirical studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aayushma Pant, Lakpa Tamang, Tsz-Kwan Lee, Sunil Aryal</p>
<p>Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify rare and irregular targets in high-dimensional hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are often noisy and unlabelled data. Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly framed as a collaborative partner in creative activities, yet children's interactions with AI have largely been studied in AI-led instructional settings rather than co-creative collaboration. This leaves open questions about how children can meaningfully engage with AI through iterative co-creation. We present Tinker Tales, a tangible storytelling system designed with narrative and social-emotional scaffolding to support child-AI collaboration. The system combines a physical storytelling board, NFC-embedded toys representing story elements (e.g., characters, places, items, and emotions), and a mobile app that mediates child-AI interaction. Children shape and refine stories by placing and moving story elements and interacting with the AI through tangible and voice-based interaction. We conducted an exploratory user study with 10 children to examine how they interacted with Tinker Tales. Our findings show that children treated the AI as an attentive, responsive collaborator, while scaffolding supported coherent narrative refinement without diminishing children's agency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have achieved remarkable success in generalizing across diverse domains. However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samaresh Kumar Singh, Joyjit Roy</p>
<p>Abstract: Though Explainable AI (XAI) has made significant advancements, its inclusion in edge and IoT systems is typically ad-hoc and inefficient. Most current methods are "coupled" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sercan Karaka\c{s}, Yusuf \c{S}im\c{s}ek</p>
<p>Abstract: Light verb constructions (LVCs) are a challenging class of verbal multiword expressions, especially in Turkish, where rich morphology and productive complex predicates create minimal contrasts between idiomatic predicate meanings and literal verb--argument uses. This paper asks what signals drive LVC classification by systematically restricting model inputs. Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices. Overall, Our findings motivate targeted evaluation of Turkish MWEs and show that ``lemma-only'' is not a single, well-defined representation, but one that depends critically on how normalization is operationalized.</p>

<p>Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in long-horizon missions that require coordination among robots with diverse capabilities. However, existing planning approaches struggle to construct accurate symbolic representations and maintain plan consistency in dynamic environments. Classical PDDL planners require manually crafted symbolic models, while LLM-based planners often ignore agent heterogeneity and environmental uncertainty. We introduce KGLAMP, a knowledge-graph-guided LLM planning framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. The framework maintains a structured knowledge graph encoding object relations, spatial reachability, and robot capabilities, which guides the LLM in generating accurate PDDL problem specifications. The knowledge graph serves as a persistent, dynamically updated memory that incorporates new observations and triggers replanning upon detecting inconsistencies, enabling symbolic plans to adapt to evolving world states. Experiments on the MAT-THOR benchmark show that KGLAMP improves performance by at least 25.5% over both LLM-only and PDDL-based variants.</p>

<p>Abstract: Vision and language models (VLMs) are expected to analyse complex documents, such as those containing flowcharts, through a question-answering (QA) interface. The ability to recognise and interpret these flowcharts is in high demand, as they provide valuable insights unavailable in text-only explanations. However, developing VLMs with precise flowchart understanding requires large-scale datasets of flowchart images and corresponding text, the creation of which is highly time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce JSynFlow, a synthesised visual QA dataset for Japanese flowcharts, generated using large language models (LLMs). Our dataset comprises task descriptions for various business occupations, the corresponding flowchart images rendered from domain-specific language (DSL) code, and related QA pairs. This paper details the dataset's synthesis procedure and demonstrates that fine-tuning with JSynFlow significantly improves VLM performance on flowchart-based QA tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yirum Kim, Jaewoo Kim, Ue-Hwan Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Current 3D scene graph generation (3DSGG) approaches heavily rely on a single-agent assumption and small-scale environments, exhibiting limited scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce Multi-Agent 3D Scene Graph Generation (MA3DSG) model, the first framework designed to tackle this scalability challenge using multiple agents. We develop a training-free graph alignment algorithm that efficiently merges partial query graphs from individual agents into a unified global scene graph. Leveraging extensive analysis and empirical insights, our approach enables conventional single-agent systems to operate collaboratively without requiring any learnable parameters. To rigorously evaluate 3DSGG performance, we propose MA3DSG-Bench-a benchmark that supports diverse agent configurations, domain sizes, and environmental conditions-providing a more general and extensible evaluation framework. This work lays a solid foundation for scalable, multi-agent 3DSGG research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihao Jing, Yuxi Long, Ganlin Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting in graph-structured domains is critical for real-world applications, yet existing spatiotemporal models often suffer from performance degradation under data scarcity and cross-domain shifts. We address these challenges through the lens of structure-aware context selection. We propose TL-GPSTGN, a transfer-oriented spatiotemporal framework that enhances sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization by selectively pruning non-optimized graph context. Specifically, our method employs information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to extract structurally informative subgraphs and features, resulting in a compact, semantically grounded representation. This optimized context is subsequently integrated into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture to capture complex multivariate dynamics. Evaluations on large-scale traffic benchmarks demonstrate that TL-GPSTGN consistently outperforms baselines in low-data transfer scenarios. Our findings suggest that explicit context pruning serves as a powerful inductive bias for improving the robustness of graph-based forecasting models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenhe Du, Qing Wu, Xuanyu Tian, Jingyi Yu, Hongjiang Wei, Yuyao Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Meiling Jin, Fei Wang, Xiaoyun Yuan, Chen Qian, Yuan Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Static sparse training is a promising route to efficient learning by committing to a fixed mask pattern, yet the constrained structure reduces robustness. Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weidong Hao</p>
<p>Abstract: Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) has attracted significant attention due to the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras. However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Angel Martinez-Sanchez, Parthib Roy, Ross Greer</p>
<p>Abstract: Instruction-grounded driving, where passenger language guides trajectory planning, requires vehicles to understand intent before motion. However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning. GitHub: https://github.com/Mi3-Lab/doScenes-VLM-Planning</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyue Wang, Yuanhe Zhang, Zhengshuo Gong, Haoran Gao, Fanyu Meng, Zhenhong Zhou, Li Sun, Yang Liu, Sen Su</p>
<p>Abstract: The enhanced capabilities of LLM-based agents come with an emergency for model planning and tool-use abilities. Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of "over-refusal", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term "Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its "usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hsien-Jyh Liao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic fluency but struggle to reliably complete long-horizon tasks under explicit procedural constraints. In legal cross-examination, purely proba-bilistic generation often maintains behavioral coherence while failing to ensure procedural advancement. We characterize this failure as procedural stagnation and propose Soft-FSM, a neuro-symbolic architecture that enforces monotonic progress over accumulated Key Information Units (KIUs) via an external deterministic state controller. Experiments on three real-world Taiwanese criminal homicide cases show that baseline methods collapse below 40% completeness, while Soft-FSM consistently achieves over 97% with near-zero redundancy. These results suggest that, in such domains, reliable task completion cannot be guaranteed by emergent LLM behavior alone, and can be reliably enforced through explicit and verifiable external state control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hyeonbeom Choi, Daechul Ahn, Youhan Lee, Taewook Kang, Seongwon Cho, Jonghyun Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic control, with test-time scaling (TTS) gaining attention to enhance robustness beyond training. However, existing TTS methods for VLAs require additional training, verifiers, and multiple forward passes, making them impractical for deployment. Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SCALE improves state-of-the-art VLAs and outperforms existing TTS methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael A. Lepori, Tal Linzen, Ann Yuan, Katja Filippova</p>
<p>Abstract: Though large language models (LLMs) have enabled great success across a wide variety of tasks, they still appear to fall short of one of the loftier goals of artificial intelligence research: creating an artificial system that can adapt its behavior to radically new contexts upon deployment. One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks.
  We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoqi Liu, Xiaoshen Han, Jiawei Gao, Yue Zhao, Haonan Chen, Yilun Du</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeming Wei, Qiaosheng Zhang, Xia Hu, Xingcheng Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved tremendous success with their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet also face safety issues similar to those of basic language models. In particular, while algorithms are designed to guide them to deliberately refuse harmful prompts with safe reasoning, this process often fails to generalize against diverse and complex jailbreak attacks. In this work, we attribute these failures to the generalization of the safe reasoning process, particularly their insufficiency against complex attack prompts. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO successfully generalizes multiple LRMs' safe reasoning adaptively across diverse attack prompts whilst preserving general utility, contributing a robust alignment technique for LRM safety.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aditya R. Bhattacharya, Debanjan Goswami, Shayok Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm integrating perception, decision-making, and control within a unified learning framework. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance. Furthermore, we deploy AppleVLM on an AGV platform and successfully showcase real-world end-to-end autonomous driving in complex outdoor environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ibrahim Albool, Malak Gamal El-Din, Salma Elmalaki, Yasser Shoukry</p>
<p>Abstract: Residual connections are the de facto standard for mitigating vanishing gradients, yet they impose structural constraints and fail to address the inherent inefficiencies of piecewise linear activations. We show that Deep Bernstein Networks (which utilizes Bernstein polynomials as activation functions) can act as residual-free architecture while simultaneously optimize trainability and representation power. We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures. By unifying these results, we demonstrate that Bernstein activations provide a superior mechanism for function approximation and signal flow. Our experiments on HIGGS and MNIST confirm that Deep Bernstein Networks achieve high-performance training without skip-connections, offering a principled path toward deep, residual-free architectures with enhanced expressive capacity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it frequently encounters challenges such as entropy collapse, excessive verbosity, and insufficient exploration for hard problems. Crucially, existing reward schemes fail to distinguish between the need for extensive search during problem-solving and the efficiency required for mastered knowledge. In this work, we introduce T2T(Thickening-to-Thinning), a dynamic reward framework inspired by human learning processes. Specifically, it implements a dual-phase mechanism: (1) On incorrect attempts, T2T incentivizes "thickening" (longer trajectories) to broaden the search space and explore novel solution paths; (2) Upon achieving correctness, it shifts to "thinning", imposing length penalties to discourage redundancy, thereby fostering model confidence and crystallizing reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME, AMC) across Qwen-series and Deepseek models demonstrate that T2T significantly outperforms standard GRPO and recent baselines, achieving superior performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: 4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

<p>Abstract: Non Pneumatic tires offer a promising alternative to pneumatic tires. However, their discontinuous spoke structures present challenges in stiffness tuning, durability, and high speed vibration. This study introduces an integrated generative design and machine learning driven framework to optimize UPTIS type spoke geometries for passenger vehicles. Upper and lower spoke profiles were parameterized using high order polynomial representations, enabling the creation of approximately 250 generative designs through PCHIP based geometric variation. Machine learning models like KRR for stiffness and XGBoost for durability and vibration achieved strong predictive accuracy, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive FEM simulations. Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization further enabled extensive performance refinement. The resulting designs demonstrate 53% stiffness tunability, up to 50% durability improvement, and 43% reduction in vibration compared to the baseline. PSO provided fast, targeted convergence, while Bayesian Optimization effectively explored multi objective tradeoffs. Overall, the proposed framework enables systematic development of high performance, next generation UPTIS spoke structures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yun Cheng, Xingyu Zhu, Haoyu Zhao, Sanjeev Arora</p>
<p>Abstract: Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sudipto Ghosh, Sujoy Nath, Sunny Manchanda, Tanmoy Chakraborty</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-expert systems, where multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) collaborate to solve complex tasks, are increasingly adopted for high-performance reasoning and generation. However, the orchestration policies governing expert interaction and sequencing remain largely opaque. We introduce INFORM, an interpretability analysis that treats orchestration as an explicit, analyzable computation, enabling the decoupling of expert interaction structure, execution order, and causal attribution. We use INFORM to evaluate an orchestrator on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MMLU using a homogeneous consortium of ten instruction-tuned experts drawn from LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen-3 8B, and DeepSeek-R1 8B, with controlled decoding-temperature variation, and a secondary heterogeneous consortium spanning 1B-7B parameter models. Across tasks, routing dominance is a poor proxy for functional necessity. We reveal a divergence between relational importance, captured by routing mass and interaction topology, and intrinsic importance, measured via gradient-based causal attribution: frequently selected experts often act as interaction hubs with limited causal influence, while sparsely routed experts can be structurally critical. Orchestration behaviors emerge asynchronously, with expert centralization preceding stable routing confidence and expert ordering remaining non-deterministic. Targeted ablations show that masking intrinsically important experts induces disproportionate collapse in interaction structure compared to masking frequent peers, confirming that INFORM exposes causal and structural dependencies beyond accuracy metrics alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanshu Wang, Shuaishuai Yang, Jingjing He, Tong Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing threats from jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. While prompt-based defenses such as Role-Oriented Prompts (RoP) and Task-Oriented Prompts (ToP) have shown effectiveness, the role of few-shot demonstrations in these defense strategies remains unclear. Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated code generation, yet the evaluation of their real-world effectiveness remains limited by static benchmarks and simplistic metrics. We present ProxyWar, a novel framework that systematically assesses code generation quality by embedding LLM-generated agents within diverse, competitive game environments. Unlike existing approaches, ProxyWar evaluates not only functional correctness but also the operational characteristics of generated programs, combining automated testing, iterative code repair, and multi-agent tournaments to provide a holistic view of program behavior. Applied to a range of state-of-the-art coders and games, our approach uncovers notable discrepancies between benchmark scores and actual performance in dynamic settings, revealing overlooked limitations and opportunities for improvement. These findings highlight the need for richer, competition-based evaluation of code generation. Looking forward, ProxyWar lays a foundation for research into LLM-driven algorithm discovery, adaptive problem solving, and the study of practical efficiency and robustness, including the potential for models to outperform hand-crafted agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Branislav Pecher, Michal Spiegel, Robert Belanec, Jan Cegin</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zipeng Zhu, Zhanghao Hu, Qinglin Zhu, Yuxi Hong, Yijun Liu, Jingyong Su, Yulan He, Lin Gui</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static "magic layer" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kahee Lim, Soyeon Kim, Steven Euijong Whang</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their fair responses across demographics has become crucial. Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., "A is better than B" vs. "B is worse than A") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of "framing disparity" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses.</p>

<p>Abstract: End-to-end prediction of high-order crystal tensor properties from atomic structures remains challenging: while spherical-harmonic equivariant models are expressive, their Clebsch-Gordan tensor products incur substantial compute and memory costs for higher-order targets. We propose the Cartesian Environment Interaction Tensor Network (CEITNet), an approach that constructs a multi-channel Cartesian local environment tensor for each atom and performs flexible many-body mixing via a learnable channel-space interaction. By performing learning in channel space and using Cartesian tensor bases to assemble equivariant outputs, CEITNet enables efficient construction of high-order tensor. Across benchmark datasets for order-2 dielectric, order-3 piezoelectric, and order-4 elastic tensor prediction, CEITNet surpasses prior high-order prediction methods on key accuracy criteria while offering high computational efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian-Wei Wang, Guanghao Meng, Ren Cai, Yaguang Song, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, but adapting them to downstream tasks typically requires costly labeled data. Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian-Wei Wang, Yaguang Song, Shu-Tao Xia</p>
<p>Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.</p>

<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling strategies have effectively leveraged inference-time compute to enhance the reasoning abilities of Autoregressive Large Language Models. In this work, we demonstrate that Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) are inherently amenable to advanced search strategies, owing to their iterative and non-autoregressive generation process. To leverage this, we propose UnMaskFork (UMF), a framework that formulates the unmasking trajectory as a search tree and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search to optimize the generation path. In contrast to standard scaling methods relying on stochastic sampling, UMF explores the search space through deterministic partial unmasking actions performed by multiple MDLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that UMF consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling baselines on complex coding benchmarks, while also exhibiting strong scalability on mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng-Fang Hsiao, Bo-Kai Ruan, Yu-Lun Liu, Hong-Han Shuai</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D editing has emerged as a critical research area to provide users with flexible control over 3D assets. While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zekun Li, Ning Wang, Tongxin Bai, Changwang Mei, Peisong Wang, Shuang Qiu, Jian Cheng</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\mathbf{> 5\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\mathbf{1.57\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\mathbf{2.28\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

<p>Abstract: Policy optimization methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants have achieved strong results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Despite extensive exploration of reward processing strategies and training dynamics, all existing group-based methods exclusively use KL divergence for policy regularization, leaving the choice of divergence function unexplored. We introduce Group-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO), a framework that extends group-based policy optimization to flexible Bregman divergences, including hand-designed alternatives (L2 in probability space) and learned neural mirror maps. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning, hand-designed ProbL2-GRPO achieves 86.7% accuracy, improving +5.5 points over the Dr. GRPO baseline. On MBPP code generation, neural mirror maps reach 60.1-60.8% pass@1, with random initialization already capturing most of the benefit. While evolutionary strategies meta-learning provides marginal accuracy improvements, its primary value lies in variance reduction ($\pm$0.2 versus $\pm$0.6) and efficiency gains (15% shorter responses on MBPP), suggesting that random initialization of neural mirror maps is sufficient for most practical applications. These results establish divergence choice as a critical, previously unexplored design dimension in group-based policy optimization for LLM reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Early detection of colorectal cancer hinges on real-time, accurate polyp identification and resection. Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings. This work provides not only a CPU-native solution for colonoscopy but also a reproducible blueprint for broader minimally invasive surgical vision applications.

Subsequently, we introduce a Blockchain-based FL model, trained collaboratively across multiple retailers without direct data sharing. Our preliminary results show that FL models have performance almost equivalent to the ideal setting in which parties share data with each other, and are notably superior to models built by individual parties without sharing data, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Distributed training of foundation models via $\texttt{DDP}$ is limited by interconnect bandwidth. While infrequent communication strategies reduce synchronization frequency, they remain bottlenecked by the memory and communication requirements of optimizer states. Low-rank optimizers can alleviate these constraints; however, in the local-update regime, workers lack access to the full-batch gradients required to compute low-rank projections, which degrades performance. We propose $\texttt{LoRDO}$, a principled framework unifying low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization. We first demonstrate that, while global projections based on pseudo-gradients are theoretically superior, they permanently restrict the optimization trajectory to a low-rank subspace. To restore subspace exploration, we introduce a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update. $\texttt{LoRDO}$ achieves near-parity with low-rank $\texttt{DDP}$ in language modeling and downstream tasks at model scales of $125$M--$720$M, while reducing communication by $\approx 10 \times$. Finally, we show that $\texttt{LoRDO}$ improves performance even more in very low-memory settings with small rank/batch size.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their outputs often exhibit social biases, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods, such as fine-tuning on additional datasets or prompt engineering, face scalability issues or compromise user experience in multi-turn interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julian Rodemann, Unai Fischer-Abaigar, James Bailie, Krikamol Muandet</p>
<p>Abstract: Performative predictions influence the very outcomes they aim to forecast. We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinglong Yang, Zhilin Peng, Zhanzhan Liu, Haochen Shi, Sheng-Jun Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\%, representing a 107\% improvement over the baseline.</p>

<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized medical institutions while preserving data privacy. However, medical FL benchmarks remain scarce, with existing efforts focusing mainly on unimodal or bimodal modalities and a limited range of medical tasks. This gap underscores the need for standardized evaluation to advance systematic understanding in medical MultiModal FL (MMFL). To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks. To support reproducibility and fair comparison of future multimodal federated learning (MMFL) methods under realistic medical settings, we release the complete benchmark implementation, including data processing and partitioning pipelines, at https://github.com/bhattarailab/Med-MMFL-Benchmark .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lunjun Zhang, Jimmy Ba</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire increasingly complex reasoning and agentic behaviors. In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&A with search engines, including 29.7% $\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA. Overall, we show that EMA-PG is a simple, principled, and powerful approach to scaling RL for LLMs. Code: https://github.com/LunjunZhang/ema-pg</p>

<p>Abstract: We present SPEAR, a multi-agent coordination framework for smart contract auditing that applies established MAS patterns in a realistic security analysis workflow. SPEAR models auditing as a coordinated mission carried out by specialized agents: a Planning Agent prioritizes contracts using risk-aware heuristics, an Execution Agent allocates tasks via the Contract Net protocol, and a Repair Agent autonomously recovers from brittle generated artifacts using a programmatic-first repair policy. Agents maintain local beliefs updated through AGM-compliant revision, coordinate via negotiation and auction protocols, and revise plans as new information becomes available. An empirical study compares the multi-agent design with centralized and pipeline-based alternatives under controlled failure scenarios, focusing on coordination, recovery behavior, and resource use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giacomo Frisoni, Lorenzo Molfetta, Davide Freddi, Gianluca Moro</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern chess language models are dense transformers trained on millions of games played by thousands of high-rated individuals. However, these monolithic networks tend to collapse into mode-averaged behavior, where stylistic boundaries are blurred, and rare but effective strategies are suppressed. To counteract homogenization, we introduce Mixture-of-Masters (MoM), the first chess mixture-of-experts model with small-sized GPT experts emulating world-class grandmasters. Each expert is trained with a combination of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning guided by chess-specific rewards. For each move, a post-hoc learnable gating network selects the most appropriate persona to channel depending on the game state, allowing MoM to switch its style dynamically$--$e.g., Tal's offensive vocation or Petrosian's defensive solidity. When evaluated against Stockfish on unseen standard games, MoM outperforms both dense individual expert networks and popular GPT baselines trained on aggregated data, while ensuring generation variety, control, and interpretability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiacheng Liang, Yuhui Wang, Tanqiu Jiang, Ting Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models introduce unique challenges for safety alignment due to their sparse routing mechanisms, which can enable degenerate optimization behaviors under standard full-parameter fine-tuning. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that naively applying full-parameter safety fine-tuning to MoE models can reduce attack success rates through routing or expert dominance effects, rather than by directly repairing Safety-Critical Experts. To address this challenge, we propose RASA, a routing-aware expert-level alignment framework that explicitly repairs Safety-Critical Experts while preventing routing-based bypasses. RASA identifies experts disproportionately activated by successful jailbreaks, selectively fine-tunes only these experts under fixed routing, and subsequently enforces routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts. Across two representative MoE architectures and a diverse set of jailbreak attacks, RASA achieves near-perfect robustness, strong cross-attack generalization, and substantially reduced over-refusal, while preserving general capabilities on benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA. Our results suggest that robust MoE safety alignment benefits from targeted expert repair rather than global parameter updates, offering a practical and architecture-preserving alternative to prior approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyi Chen, Eun Cheol Choi, Yingjia Luo, Xinyi Wang, Yulei Xiao, Aizi Yang, Luca Luceri</p>
<p>Abstract: People increasingly seek advice online from both human peers and large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. Such advice rarely involves identifying a single correct answer; instead, it typically requires navigating trade-offs among competing values. We aim to characterize how LLMs navigate value trade-offs across different advice-seeking contexts. First, we examine the value trade-off structure underlying advice seeking using a curated dataset from four advice-oriented subreddits. Using a bottom-up approach, we inductively construct a hierarchical value framework by aggregating fine-grained values extracted from individual advice options into higher-level value categories. We construct value co-occurrence networks to characterize how values co-occur within dilemmas and find substantial heterogeneity in value trade-off structures across advice-seeking contexts: a women-focused subreddit exhibits the highest network density, indicating more complex value conflicts; women's, men's, and friendship-related subreddits exhibit highly correlated value-conflict patterns centered on security-related tensions (security vs. respect/connection/commitment); by contrast, career advice forms a distinct structure where security frequently clashes with self-actualization and growth. We then evaluate LLM value preferences against these dilemmas and find that, across models and contexts, LLMs consistently prioritize values related to Exploration & Growth over Benevolence & Connection. This systemically skewed value orientation highlights a potential risk of value homogenization in AI-mediated advice, raising concerns about how such systems may shape decision-making and normative outcomes at scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Masaya Tsunokake, Yuta Koreeda, Terufumi Morishita, Koichi Nagatsuka, Hikaru Tomonari, Yasuhiro Sogawa</p>
<p>Abstract: When applying LLMs to real-world enterprise operations, LLMs need to handle proprietary knowledge in small domains of specific operations ($\textbf{micro domains}$). A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability.</p>

<p>Abstract: This letter proposes a novel three-tier content caching architecture for Vehicular Fog Caching (VFC)-assisted platoon, where the VFC is formed by the vehicles driving near the platoon. The system strategically coordinates storage across local platoon vehicles, dynamic VFC clusters, and cloud server (CS) to minimize content retrieval latency. To efficiently manage distributed storage, we integrate large language models (LLMs) for real-time and intelligent caching decisions. The proposed approach leverages LLMs' ability to process heterogeneous information, including user profiles, historical data, content characteristics, and dynamic system states. Through a designed prompting framework encoding task objectives and caching constraints, the LLMs formulate caching as a decision-making task, and our hierarchical deterministic caching mapping strategy enables adaptive requests prediction and precise content placement across three tiers without frequent retraining. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed caching scheme.</p>

<p>Abstract: Constructing mechanistic models of neural circuits is a fundamental goal of neuroscience, yet verifying such models is limited by the lack of ground truth. To rigorously test model discovery, we establish an in silico testbed using neuromechanical simulations of a larval zebrafish as a transparent ground truth. We find that LLM-based tree search autonomously discovers predictive models that significantly outperform established forecasting baselines. Conditioning on sensory drive is necessary but not sufficient for faithful system identification, as models exploit statistical shortcuts. Structural priors prove essential for enabling robust out-of-distribution generalization and recovery of interpretable mechanistic models. Our insights provide guidance for modeling real-world neural recordings and offer a broader template for AI-driven scientific discovery.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuanhua Yin, Runkai Zhao, Lina Yao, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Naturalistic fMRI characterizes the brain as a dynamic predictive engine driven by continuous sensory streams. However, modeling the causal forward evolution in realistic neural simulation is impeded by the timescale mismatch between multimodal inputs and the complex topology of cortical networks. To address these challenges, we introduce BrainVista, a multimodal autoregressive framework designed to model the causal evolution of brain states. BrainVista incorporates Network-wise Tokenizers to disentangle system-specific dynamics and a Spatial Mixer Head that captures inter-network information flow without compromising functional boundaries. Furthermore, we propose a novel Stimulus-to-Brain (S2B) masking mechanism to synchronize high-frequency sensory stimuli with hemodynamically filtered signals, enabling strict, history-only causal conditioning. We validate our framework on Algonauts 2025, CineBrain, and HAD, achieving state-of-the-art fMRI encoding performance. In long-horizon rollout settings, our model yields substantial improvements over baselines, increasing pattern correlation by 36.0\% and 33.3\% on relative to the strongest baseline Algonauts 2025 and CineBrain, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Andr\'es Holgado-S\'anchez, Holger Billhardt, Alberto Fern\'andez, Sascha Ossowski</p>
<p>Abstract: Agreement Technologies refer to open computer systems in which autonomous software agents interact with one another, typically on behalf of humans, in order to come to mutually acceptable agreements. With the advance of AI systems in recent years, it has become apparent that such agreements, in order to be acceptable to the involved parties, must remain aligned with ethical principles and moral values. However, this is notoriously difficult to ensure, especially as different human users (and their software agents) may hold different value systems, i.e. they may differently weigh the importance of individual moral values. Furthermore, it is often hard to specify the precise meaning of a value in a particular context in a computational manner. Methods to estimate value systems based on human-engineered specifications, e.g. based on value surveys, are limited in scale due to the need for intense human moderation. In this article, we propose a novel method to automatically \emph{learn} value systems from observations and human demonstrations. In particular, we propose a formal model of the \emph{value system learning} problem, its instantiation to sequential decision-making domains based on multi-objective Markov decision processes, as well as tailored preference-based and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms to infer value grounding functions and value systems. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by two simulated use cases.</p>

<p>Abstract: Rapid urban expansion has fueled the growth of informal settlements in major cities of low- and middle-income countries, with Lahore and Karachi in Pakistan and Mumbai in India serving as prominent examples. However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gang Lin, Dongfang Li, Zhuoen Chen, Yukun Shi, Xuhui Chen, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.</p>

<p>Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge for neural networks when tasks are trained sequentially. In this work, we reformulate continual learning as a control problem where learning and preservation signals compete within neural activity dynamics. We convert regularization penalties into preservation signals that protect prior-task representations. Learning then proceeds by minimizing the control effort required to integrate new tasks while competing with the preservation of prior tasks. At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage. Experiments confirm that our learning framework recovers true prior-task curvature and enables task discrimination, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks without replay.</p>

OmniRad is evaluated on a broad suite of public benchmarks spanning classification and segmentation across multiple modalities. On the MedMNISTv2 collection, OmniRad improves classification F1 by up to 2.05% over competing foundation models. For dense prediction, OmniRad attains mean Dice score improvements across six MedSegBench datasets when using frozen representations.

<p>Abstract: Emerging networked systems such as industrial IoT and real-time cyber-physical infrastructures demand intelligent scheduling strategies capable of adapting to dynamic traffic, deadlines, and interference constraints. In this work, we present a novel Digital Twin-enabled scheduling framework inspired by Dual Mind World Model (DMWM) architecture, for learning-informed and imagination-driven network control. Unlike conventional rule-based or purely data-driven policies, the proposed DMWM combines short-horizon predictive planning with symbolic model-based rollout, enabling the scheduler to anticipate future network states and adjust transmission decisions accordingly. We implement the framework in a configurable simulation testbed and benchmark its performance against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines under varied traffic conditions. Our results show that DMWM achieves superior performance in bursty, interference-limited, and deadline-sensitive environments, while maintaining interpretability and sample efficiency. The proposed design bridges the gap between network-level reasoning and low-overhead learning, marking a step toward scalable and adaptive NDT-based network optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaeyoon Jung, Yejun Yoon, Seunghyun Yoon, Kunwoo Park</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper describes VILLAIN, a multimodal fact-checking system that verifies image-text claims through prompt-based multi-agent collaboration. For the AVerImaTeC shared task, VILLAIN employs vision-language model agents across multiple stages of fact-checking. Textual and visual evidence is retrieved from the knowledge store enriched through additional web collection. To identify key information and address inconsistencies among evidence items, modality-specific and cross-modal agents generate analysis reports. In the subsequent stage, question-answer pairs are produced based on these reports. Finally, the Verdict Prediction agent produces the verification outcome based on the image-text claim and the generated question-answer pairs. Our system ranked first on the leaderboard across all evaluation metrics. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ssu-humane/VILLAIN.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rahul Bajaj, Anuj Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Encoder-only transformers remain indispensable in retrieval, classification, and ranking systems where latency, stability, and cost are paramount. Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Luyi Sun, Wei Xu, Zaifeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: As the paradigm of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) gains prominence, its benefits to society are accompanied by significant ethical concerns, one of which is the protection of individual privacy. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of privacy within HCAI, proposing a human-centered privacy (HCP) framework, providing integrated solution from technology, ethics, and human factors perspectives. The chapter begins by mapping privacy risks across each stage of AI development lifecycle, from data collection to deployment and reuse, highlighting the impact of privacy risks on the entire system. The chapter then introduces privacy-preserving techniques such as federated learning and dif erential privacy. Subsequent chapters integrate the crucial user perspective by examining mental models, alongside the evolving regulatory and ethical landscapes as well as privacy governance. Next, advice on design guidelines is provided based on the human-centered privacy framework. After that, we introduce practical case studies across diverse fields. Finally, the chapter discusses persistent open challenges and future research directions, concluding that a multidisciplinary approach, merging technical, design, policy, and ethical expertise, is essential to successfully embed privacy into the core of HCAI, thereby ensuring these technologies advance in a manner that respects and ensures human autonomy, trust and dignity.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b>  Tse-Hsun (Peter),  Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Software Engineering (SE) agents have shown promising abilities in supporting various SE tasks. Current SE agents remain fundamentally reactive, making decisions mainly based on conversation history and the most recent response. However, this reactive design provides no explicit structure or persistent state within the agent's memory, making long-horizon reasoning challenging. As a result, SE agents struggle to maintain a coherent understanding across reasoning steps, adapt their hypotheses as new evidence emerges, or incorporate execution feedback into the mental reasoning model of the system state.
  In this position paper, we argue that, to further advance SE agents, we need to move beyond reactive behavior toward a structured, state-aware, and execution-grounded reasoning. We outline how explicit structure, persistent and evolving state, and the integration of execution-grounded feedback can help SE agents perform more coherent and reliable reasoning in long-horizon tasks. We also provide an initial roadmap for developing next-generation SE agents that can more effectively perform real-world tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaemoo Choi, Yuchen Zhu, Wei Guo, Petr Molodyk, Bo Yuan, Jinbin Bai, Yi Xin, Molei Tao, Yongxin Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xianbiao Qi, Marco Chen, Jiaquan Ye, Yelin He, Rong Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: The Muon optimizer has recently attracted considerable attention for its strong empirical performance and use of orthogonalized updates on matrix-shaped parameters, yet its underlying mechanisms and relationship to adaptive optimizers such as Adam remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eun Cheol Choi, Lindsay E. Young, Emilio Ferrara</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Zhou, Zhirui Wang, Qi Hong, Yunyang Shi, Ziyuan Gu, Zhiyuan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting in real-world applications requires both high predictive accuracy and interpretable uncertainty quantification. Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial.</p>

<p>Abstract: We study the fine-grained text-to-audio (T2A) generation task. While recent models can synthesize high-quality audio from text descriptions, they often lack precise control over attributes such as loudness, pitch, and sound events. Unlike prior approaches that retrain models for specific control types, we propose to train ControlNet models on top of pre-trained T2A backbones to achieve controllable generation over loudness, pitch, and event roll. We introduce two designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter, and show that the T2A-Adapter model offers a more efficient structure with strong control ability. With only 38M additional parameters, T2A-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioSet-Strong in both event-level and segment-level F1 scores. We further extend this framework to audio editing, proposing T2A-Editor for removing and inserting audio events at time locations specified by instructions. Models, code, dataset pipelines, and benchmarks will be released to support future research on controllable audio generation and editing.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sijia Chen, Lijuan Ma, Yanqiu Yu, En Yu, Liman Liu, Wenbing Tao</p>
<p>Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sagie Dekel, Moshe Tennenholtz, Oren Kurland</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a highly effective paradigm for keeping LLM-based responses up-to-date and reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLMs' output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David F. Ramirez, Tim Overman, Kristen Jaskie, Joe Marvin, Andreas Spanias</p>
<p>Abstract: We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.</p>

<p>Abstract: Aligning text-to-image generation with user intent remains challenging, for users who provide ambiguous inputs and struggle with model idiosyncrasies. We propose Adaptive Prompt Elicitation (APE), a technique that adaptively asks visual queries to help users refine prompts without extensive writing. Our technical contribution is a formulation of interactive intent inference under an information-theoretic framework. APE represents latent intent as interpretable feature requirements using language model priors, adaptively generates visual queries, and compiles elicited requirements into effective prompts. Evaluation on IDEA-Bench and DesignBench shows that APE achieves stronger alignment with improved efficiency. A user study with challenging user-defined tasks demonstrates 19.8% higher alignment without workload overhead. Our work contributes a principled approach to prompting that, for general users, offers an effective and efficient complement to the prevailing prompt-based interaction paradigm with text-to-image models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Moritz Miller, Florent Draye, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent progress on fine-tuning language models around a fixed sparse autoencoder, we disentangle the decoder matrix into almost orthogonal features. This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.</p>

The ensuing response of software engineering research yielded a massive body of tools and approaches. In this paper, we join the hassle by introducing agentic AI solutions for two tasks.

This approach relies on specialized worker agents forming a star topology with the supervisor agent in the middle. We demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world example. Second, we developed an agentic AI solution for the document retrieval task in the context of software engineering documents. Our solution enables performing various use cases on a body of documents related to the development of a single software, including search, question answering, tracking changes, and large document summarization. In this case, each use case is handled by a dedicated LLM-based agent, which performs all subtasks related to the corresponding use case.

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire unintended biases from seemingly benign training data even without explicit cues or malicious content. Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Casey Ford, Madison Van Doren, Emily Dix</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for political stance detection in informal online discourse, where language is often sarcastic, ambiguous, and context-dependent. We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\% to +38.5\%, achieving up to 74\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts. These findings underscore the value of incorporating user-level context to enhance LLM performance in nuanced political classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyu Zhou, Chang Jin, Carsten Eickhoff, Zhijiang Guo, Seyed Ali Bahrainian</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Liu, Pratap Tokekar, Ming Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly equipped with heterogeneous multimodal sensors, enabling richer perception but introducing modality-specific and agent-dependent uncertainty. Existing multi-agent collaboration frameworks typically reason at the agent level, assume homogeneous sensing, and handle uncertainty implicitly, limiting robustness under sensor corruption. We propose Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML), a principled approach for uncertainty-aware, modality-level collaboration. A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities. Extensive experiments on connected autonomous driving scenarios for collaborative accident detection demonstrate that A2MAML consistently outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines, achieving up to 18.7% higher accident detection rate.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maya Bechler-Speicher, Yoel Gottlieb, Andrey Isakov, David Abensur, Ami Tavory, Daniel Haimovich, Ido Guy, Udi Weinsberg</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph-structured data underpins many critical applications. While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Congjing Zhang, Ryan Feng Lin, Ruoxuan Bao, Shuai Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: While tabular data is fundamental to many real-world machine learning (ML) applications, acquiring high-quality tabular data is usually labor-intensive and expensive. Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jia-peng Zhang, Cheng-Feng Pu, Meng-Hao Guo, Yan-Pei Cao, Shi-Min Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elizabeth Bates, Chris Hicks, Vasilios Mavroudis</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiarui Yuan, Tailin Jin, Weize Chen, Zeyuan Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farzia Hossain, Samanta Ghosh, Shahida Begum, B. M. Shahria Alam, Mohammad Tahmid Noor, Md Parvez Mia, Nishat Tasnim Niloy</p>
<p>Abstract: Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.</p>

<p>Abstract: Urban traffic management demands systems that simultaneously predict future conditions, detect anomalies, and take safe corrective actions -- all while providing reliability guarantees. We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\% compared to 69\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Our theoretical understanding of neural networks is lagging behind their empirical success. One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present El Agente Estructural, a multimodal, natural-language-driven geometry-generation and manipulation agent for autonomous chemistry and molecular modelling. Unlike molecular generation or editing via generative models, Estructural mimics how human experts directly manipulate molecular systems in three dimensions by integrating a comprehensive set of domain-informed tools and vision-language models. This design enables precise control over atomic or functional group replacements, atomic connectivity, and stereochemistry without the need to rebuild extensive core molecular frameworks. Through a series of representative case studies, we demonstrate that Estructural enables chemically meaningful geometry manipulation across a wide range of real-world scenarios. These include site-selective functionalization, ligand binding, ligand exchange, stereochemically controlled structure construction, isomer interconversion, fragment-level structural analysis, image-guided generation of structures from schematic reaction mechanisms, and mechanism-driven geometry generation and modification. These examples illustrate how multimodal reasoning, when combined with specialized geometry-aware tools, supports interactive and context-aware molecular modelling beyond structure generation. Looking forward, the integration of Estructural into El Agente Quntur, an autonomous multi-agent quantum chemistry platform, enhances its capabilities by adding sophisticated tools for the generation and editing of three-dimensional structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a foundational enabling tool for the fields of chemistry, materials science, computational biology and others. Despite of its power, the practical application of quantum chemistry simulations remains in the hands of qualified experts due to methodological complexity, software heterogeneity, and the need for informed interpretation of results. To bridge the accessibility gap for these tools and expand their reach to chemists with broader backgrounds, we introduce El Agente Quntur, a hierarchical, multi-agent AI system designed to operate not merely as an automation tool but as a research collaborator for computational quantum chemistry. Quntur was designed following three main strategies: i) elimination of hard-coded procedural policies in favour of reasoning-driven decisions, ii) construction of general and composable actions that facilitate generalization and efficiency, and iii) implementation of guided deep research to integrate abstract quantum-chemical reasoning across subdisciplines and a detailed understanding of the software's internal logic and syntax. Although instantiated in ORCA, these design principles are applicable to research agents more generally and easily expandable to additional quantum chemistry packages and beyond. Quntur supports the full range of calculations available in ORCA 6.0 and reasons over software documentation and scientific literature to plan, execute, adapt, and analyze in silico chemistry experiments following best practices. We discuss the advances and current bottlenecks in agentic systems operating at the research level in computational chemistry, and outline a roadmap toward a fully autonomous end-to-end computational chemistry research agent.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryan Liu, Eric Qu, Tobias Kreiman, Samuel M. Blau, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets.
  We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yannick Denker, Alexander Gepperth</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) requires agents to learn from a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired policies. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nicholas Barnfield, Subhabrata Sen, Pragya Sur</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent progress has rapidly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in modern attention-based neural networks. However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Penghui Qi, Xiangxin Zhou, Zichen Liu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Min Lin, Wee Sun Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) deployments operate in nonstationary, dynamic environments where factors such as sensor drift, evolving user behavior, and heterogeneous user privacy requirements can affect application utility. Continual learning (CL) addresses this by adapting models over time without catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful representation-learning paradigm that improves robustness and sample efficiency in a self-supervised manner. This paper reviews the usage of \emph{contrastive continual learning} (CCL) for IoT, connecting algorithmic design (replay, regularization, distillation, prompts) with IoT system realities (TinyML constraints, intermittent connectivity, privacy). We present a unifying problem formulation, derive common objectives that blend contrastive and distillation losses, propose an IoT-oriented reference architecture for on-device, edge, and cloud-based CCL, and provide guidance on evaluation protocols and metrics. Finally, we highlight open unique challenges with respect to the IoT domain, such as spanning tabular and streaming IoT data, concept drift, federated settings, and energy-aware training.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanru Qu, Cheng-Yen Hsieh, Zaixiang Zheng, Ge Liu, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonsu Kim, Hyoungwook Jin, Hayeon Doh, Eunhye Kim, Dongyun Jung, Seungju Kim, Kiyoon Choi, Jinho Son, Juho Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Students' handwritten math work provides a rich resource for diagnosing cognitive skills, as it captures intermediate reasoning beyond final answers. We investigate how current large language models (LLMs) perform in diagnosing cognitive skills from such work. However, student responses vary widely, often omitting steps or providing only vague, contextually implicit evidence. Despite recent advances in LLMs' multimodal and reasoning capabilities, their performance under such conditions remains underexplored. To address this gap, we constructed MathCog, a benchmark dataset containing 3,036 diagnostic verdicts across 639 student responses to 110 math problems, annotated by teachers using TIMSS-grounded cognitive skill checklists with evidential strength labels (Evident/Vague). Evaluating 18 LLMs, we find that (1) all models underperform (F1 < 0.5) regardless of capability, and (2) performance degrades sharply under vague evidence. Error analysis reveals systematic patterns: models frequently misattribute Vague evidence as Evident, overthink minimal cues, and hallucinate nonexistent evidence. We discuss implications for evidence-aware, teacher-in-the-loop designs for LLM-based cognitive diagnosis in educational settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid growth of large-scale single-cell omic datasets, omic foundation models (FMs) have emerged as powerful tools for advancing research in life sciences and precision medicine. However, most existing omic FMs rely primarily on numerical transcriptomic data by sorting genes as sequences, while lacking explicit integration of biomedical prior knowledge and signaling interactions that are critical for scientific discovery. Here, we introduce the Text-Omic Signaling Graph (TOSG), a novel data structure that unifies human-interpretable biomedical textual knowledge, quantitative omic data, and signaling network information. Using this framework, we construct OmniCellTOSG, a large-scale resource comprising approximately half million meta-cell TOSGs derived from around 80 million single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq profiles across organs and diseases. We further develop CellTOSG-FM, a multimodal graph language FM, to jointly analyze textual, omic and signaling network context. Across diverse downstream tasks, CellTOSG-FM outperforms existing omic FMs, and provides interpretable insights into disease-associated targets and signaling pathways.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ruihang Wang, Qingang Zhang, Yonggang Wen, Stuart Kennedy</p>
<p>Abstract: The revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) has brought sustainable challenges in data center management due to the high carbon emissions and short cooling response time associated with high-power density racks. While machine learning (ML) offers promise for intelligent management, its adoption is hindered by safety and reliability concerns. To address this, we propose a multiphysics-informed machine learning (MPIML) framework that integrates physical priors into data-driven models for enhanced accuracy and safety. We introduce an integrated system architecture comprising three core engines: DCLib for versatile facility modeling, DCTwin for high-fidelity multiphysics simulation, and DCBrain for decision-making optimization. This system enables critical predictive and prescriptive applications, such as carbon-aware IT provisioning, safety-aware intelligent cooling control and battery health forecasting. An illustrative example on an industry-grade data center cooling control demonstrates that our MPIML approach reduces annual carbon emissions up to 200 kilotons compared with conventional methods while ensuring operational constraints are met. We conclude by outlining key challenges and future directions for developing autonomous and sustainable data centers.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Khurram Yamin, Gaurav Ghosal, Bryan Wilder</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junzhe Li, Yutao Cui, Tao Huang, Yinping Ma, Chun Fan, Miles Yang, Zhao Zhong, Liefeng Bo</p>
<p>Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO and DanceGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for faster sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Si Chen, Izzy Molnar, Ting Hua, Peiyu Li, Le Huy Khiem, G. Alex Ambrose, Jim Lang, Ronald Metoyer, Nitesh V. Chawla</p>
<p>Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain, SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage. Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Li, Han Zhang, Zhantao Yang, Fangyi Chen, Zihan Wang, Anudeepsekhar Bolimera, Marios Savvides</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning, which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H, STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3% higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently outperforms across all OOD benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hung-Tien Huang, Dzung Dinh, Junier B. Oliva</p>
<p>Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which, at inference time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement learning policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library of feature templates -- sets of features that are jointly informative -- and uses this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and computation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Leonidas Bakopoulos, Georgios Chalkiadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across several environments.</p>

<h1> replace <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434">Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiahao Yu, Zelei Cheng, Xian Wu, Xinyu Xing</p>
<p>Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve real-world issues. A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs. While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS. Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce EntroPO, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting. EntroPO augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses. We validate EntroPO by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches. On the SWEBENCH leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with EntroPO ranks 1st on SWEBENCH-LITE and 4th on SWEBENCH-VERIFIED on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(e.g., >$350B).</p>

Each EG encodes seven acoustic features (e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy over zero-shot baselines.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Vincent Tu, Chih-Lun Lee, Jiachen Yang, Ang Li, Xin Eric Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their performance on long-horizon, complex problems remains unreliable. Single-rollout execution is brittle, with small errors compounding over time and leading to high variance in outcomes. While prior work has attempted to scale within a single rollout, such approaches have yielded limited gains. Scaling over multiple rollouts offers a more promising alternative but doing so effectively is challenging due to the difficulty of evaluating and selecting among long-horizon agent behaviors. We introduce Behavior Judge (BJudge), which addresses this challenge by representing agent executions as behavior narratives and comparing candidate behaviors at this level, substantially improving robustness and success rates. Using multiple rollouts, BJudge establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) in OSWorld at 72.6%, significantly outperforming prior methods and surpassing human-level performance at 72.36%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the strong effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and BJudge provides a practical framework to achieve this.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce catastrophic responses in conversational settings that pose serious risks to public safety and security.Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations.In this work, we propose C$^3$LLM, a novel, principled statistical Certification framework for Catastrophic risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions with statistical guarantees.We model multi-turn conversations as probability distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions--random node, graph path, and adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models, with certified lower bounds as high as 70\% for the worst model, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.</p>

Experiments across multiple multimodal backbones and subjects show consistent improvements over strong baselines, enhanced cross-subject generalization, and interpretable expert patterns that correlate with content type.

<p>Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional memory or computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform across a planning horizon and that certain parts of a predicted trajectory should be more densely generated. We propose Mixed-Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters. We show that MDD surpasses the SOTA Diffusion Veteran (DV) framework across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (D4RL) task domains, achieving a new SOTA on the D4RL benchmark.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable inference-time improvements through parallel thinking. However, existing methods rely on redundant sampling of reasoning trajectories, failing to effectively explore the reasoning space to uncover high-quality solutions. To address these limitations, we propose Decoding Tree Sketching (DTS), a plug-and-play decoding framework for structural multi-trajectory exploration and reasoning selection. For reasoning exploration, DTS sketches a backbone tree of the reasoning space by selectively branching at decision tokens. For reasoning selection, guided by length-accuracy anti-correlation, DTS designs an early termination to prioritize short and reliable trajectories during decoding. Experimental results across four LRMs and datasets demonstrate that DTS significantly enhances accuracy by 14% and reduces repetitive generation by 8% on average. Notably, DTS enables smaller models to outperform larger models with 10$\times$ the size, highlighting its potential to strengthen reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mengyu Zhang, Siyu Ding, Weichong Yin, Yu Sun, Hua Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards(RLVR) has demonstrated great potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, its success has thus far been largely confined to the mathematical and programming domains with clear and automatically checkable outcomes. Reinforcement learning on open-ended tasks (e.g., creative writing and subjective Q&A) continues to rely on reward models due to the absence of verifiable solutions. This raises a key question: how can we extend RLVR to strengthen reasoning in open-ended tasks regardless of the absence of the unambiguous ground truth? To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (VMR-RLVR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across seven open-ended benchmarks, our VMR-RLVR training delivers an average gain of 3.29 points over the RL with reward model.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingtong Yue, Ziqi Huang, Zhaoxi Chen, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Ziwei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohan Zhang, Tian Gao, Mingyue Cheng, Bokai Pan, Ze Guo, Yaguo Liu, Xiaoyu Tao, Qi Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making across many real-world applications. Despite substantial progress, most existing methods still treat forecasting as a static, single-pass regression problem. In contrast, human experts form predictions through iterative reasoning that integrates temporal features, domain knowledge, case-based references, and supplementary context, with continuous refinement. In this work, we propose CastMind, an interaction-driven agentic reasoning framework that enables accurate time series forecasting with training-free large language models. CastMind reformulates forecasting as an expert-like process and organizes it into a multi-stage workflow involving context preparation, reasoning-based generation, and reflective evaluation, transforming forecasting from a single-pass output into a multi-turn, autonomous interaction process. To support diverse perspectives commonly considered by human experts, we develop a lightweight toolkit comprising a feature set, a knowledge base, a case library, and a contextual pool that provides external support for LLM-based reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that CastMind generally outperforms representative baselines. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/SkyeGT/CastMind .</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyue Zhao, Dingqi Chen, Shaoyu Wang, Pan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: DatalogMTL extends the classical Datalog language with metric temporal logic (MTL), enabling expressive reasoning over temporal data. While existing reasoning approaches, such as materialisation based and automata based methods, offer soundness and completeness, they lack support for handling efficient dynamic updates, a crucial requirement for real-world applications that involve frequent data updates. In this work, we propose DRedMTL, an incremental reasoning algorithm for DatalogMTL with bounded intervals. Our algorithm builds upon the classical DRed algorithm, which incrementally updates the materialisation of a Datalog program. Unlike a Datalog materialisation which is in essence a finite set of facts, a DatalogMTL materialisation has to be represented as a finite set of facts plus periodic intervals indicating how the full materialisation can be constructed through unfolding. To cope with this, our algorithm is equipped with specifically designed operators to efficiently handle such periodic representations of DatalogMTL materialisations. We have implemented this approach and tested it on several publicly available datasets. Experimental results show that DRedMTL often significantly outperforms rematerialisation, sometimes by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present M^3-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal tool use under the Model Context Protocol. The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhaoyang Liu, Mokai Pan, Zhongyi Wang, Kaizhen Zhu, Haotao Lu, Haipeng Zhang, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Imitation learning with diffusion models has advanced robotic control by capturing the multi-modal action distributions. However, existing methods typically treat observations only as high-level conditions to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, the sampling is forced to begin from random noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We propose BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that directly integrates observations into the stochastic dynamics via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich and informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key difficulty is that diffusion bridge normally connects distributions of matched dimensionality, while robotic observations are heterogeneous and not naturally aligned with actions. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner to unify the visual and state inputs and align the observations with action representations, making diffusion bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and 5 real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongqiang Yu, Xuhui Li, Hazza Mahmood, Jinxing Zhou, Haodong Hong, Longtao Jiang, Zhiqiang Xu, Qi Wu, Xiaojun Chang</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-world deployment of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents is constrained by the scarcity of reliable supervision after offline training. While recent adaptation methods attempt to mitigate distribution shifts via environment-driven self-supervision (e.g., entropy minimization), these signals are often noisy and can cause the agent to amplify its own mistakes during long-horizon sequential decision-making. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift that positions user feedback, specifically episode-level success confirmations and goal-level corrections, as a primary and general-purpose supervision signal for VLN. Unlike internal confidence scores, user feedback is intent-aligned and in-situ consistent, directly correcting the agent's decoupling from user instructions. To effectively leverage this supervision, we introduce a user-feedback-driven learning framework featuring a topology-aware trajectory construction pipeline. This mechanism lifts sparse, goal-level corrections into dense path-level supervision by generating feasible paths on the agent's incrementally built topological graph, enabling sample-efficient imitation learning without requiring step-by-step human demonstrations. Furthermore, we develop a persistent memory bank mechanism for warm-start initialization, supporting the reuse of previously acquired topology and cached representations across navigation sessions. Extensive experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark demonstrate that our approach transforms sparse interaction into robust supervision, consistently outperforming environment-driven baselines while exhibiting strong adaptability across diverse instruction styles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tomoaki Yamaguchi, Yutong Zhou, Masahiro Ryo, Keisuke Katsura</p>
<p>Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Zhang, Chaofa Yuan, Ryan Guo, Xiaomin Yu, Rui Xu, Zhangquan Chen, Zinuo Li, Zhi Yang, Shuhao Guan, Zhenheng Tang, Sen Hu, Liwen Zhang, Ronghao Chen, Huacan Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: While LLM-based agents have shown promise for deep research, most existing approaches rely on fixed workflows that struggle to adapt to real-world, open-ended queries. Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiming Xue, Sichen Zhao, Yalun Qi, Xianling Zeng, Zihan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of the e-commerce industry, the logistics network is experiencing unprecedented pressure. The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Wang, Hao Wang, Shi Feng, Xiaocui Yang, Daling Wang, Yiqun Zhang, Jinghao Lin, Haihua Yang, Xiaozhong Ji</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical reasoning models remain constrained by parametric knowledge and are thus susceptible to forgetting and hallucinations. DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains. We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus "find it but fail to use it," leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot. Overall, on seven medical benchmarks, DeepMed improves its base model by 9.79\% on average and outperforms larger medical reasoning and DR models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Deng, Zhen Fang, Sharon Li, Ling Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyun Wang, Dian Li, Xiaohan Wang, Gang Liu, Jiahong Yan, Guoliang Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiecong Wang, Hao Peng, Chunyang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaorui Shi, Shugui Liu, Yu Yang, Wenyu Mao, Yuxin Chen, Qi GU, Hui Su, Xunliang Cai, Xiang Wang, An Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Liu, Tianle Chen, Ryan Amiri, Christopher Amato</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ed Li, Junyu Ren, Cat Yan</p>
<p>Abstract: While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +16.7pp while quality metrics improve by up to 47%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent systems on various domains. By addressing these challenges, our work takes a first step toward scaling multiagent systems for complex, long-horizon tasks with minimal human supervision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yepeng Liu, Yu Huang, Yu-Xiang Wang, Yingbin Liang, Yuheng Bu</p>
<p>Abstract: Convex analysis is a modern branch of mathematics with many applications. As Large Language Models (LLMs) start to automate research-level math and sciences, it is important for LLMs to demonstrate the ability to understand and reason with convexity. We introduce \cb, a scalable and mechanically verifiable benchmark for testing \textit{whether LLMs can identify the convexity of a symbolic objective under deep functional composition.} Experiments on frontier LLMs reveal a sharp compositional reasoning gap: performance degrades rapidly with increasing depth, dropping from an F1-score of $1.0$ at depth $2$ to approximately $0.2$ at depth $100$. Inspection of models' reasoning traces indicates two failure modes: \textit{parsing failure} and \textit{lazy reasoning}. To address these limitations, we propose an agentic divide-and-conquer framework that (i) offloads parsing to an external tool to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) and (ii) enforces recursive reasoning over each intermediate sub-expression with focused context. This framework reliably mitigates deep-composition failures, achieving substantial performance improvement at large depths (e.g., F1-Score $= 1.0$ at depth $100$).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yiliang Song, Hongjun An, Jiangong Xiao, Haofei Zhao, Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Leaderboard scores on public benchmarks have been steadily rising and converging, with many frontier language models now separated by only marginal differences. However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.</p>

<p>Abstract: We build a custom transformer model to study how neural networks make moral decisions on trolley-style dilemmas. The model processes structured scenarios using embeddings that encode who is affected, how many people, and which outcome they belong to. Our 2-layer architecture achieves 77% accuracy on Moral Machine data while remaining small enough for detailed analysis. We use different interpretability techniques to uncover how moral reasoning distributes across the network, demonstrating that biases localize to distinct computational stages among other findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Philip A. LeMaitre, Marius Krumm, Hans J. Briegel</p>
<p>Abstract: With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However, most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits, including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are discussed.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Megha Srivastava, Cedric Colas, Dorsa Sadigh, Jacob Andreas</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern AI systems such as self-driving cars and game-playing agents achieve superhuman performance, but often lack human-like generalization, interpretability, and inter-operability with human users. Inspired by the rich interactions between language and decision-making in humans, we introduce Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck (PLLB), a framework enabling AI agents to generate linguistic rules that capture the high-level strategies underlying rewarding behaviors. PLLB alternates between a *rule generation* step guided by language models, and an *update* step where agents learn new policies guided by rules, even when a rule is insufficient to describe an entire complex policy. Across five diverse tasks, including a two-player signaling game, maze navigation, image reconstruction, and robot grasp planning, we show that PLLB agents are not only able to learn more interpretable and generalizable behaviors, but can also share the learned rules with human users, enabling more effective human-AI coordination. We provide source code for our experiments at https://github.com/meghabyte/bottleneck .</p>

<p>Abstract: We study efficient mechanism design for allocating multiple heterogeneous objects. The aim is to maximize the residual surplus, the total value generated from an allocation minus the costs of screening. We discover a robust trend indicating that no-screening mechanisms, such as serial dictatorship with exogenous priority order, tend to perform better as the variety of goods increases. We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing asymptotically efficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated mechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and validate the trend in general environments. Building on these implications, we propose the register-invite-book system (RIB) as an efficient system for scheduling vaccinations against pandemic diseases.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Udvas Das, Debabrota Basu</p>
<p>Abstract: Pure exploration in bandits formalises multiple real-world problems, such as tuning hyper-parameters or conducting user studies to test a set of items, where different safety, resource, and fairness constraints on the decision space naturally appear. We study these problems as pure exploration in multi-armed bandits with unknown linear constraints, where the aim is to identify an $r$-optimal and feasible policy as fast as possible with a given level of confidence. First, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation of the sample complexity lower bound for pure exploration under constraints. Second, we leverage properties of convex optimisation in the Lagrangian lower bound to propose two computationally efficient extensions of Track-and-Stop and Gamified Explorer, namely LATS and LAGEX. Then, we propose a constraint-adaptive stopping rule, and while tracking the lower bound, use optimistic estimate of the feasible set at each step. We show that LAGEX achieves asymptotically optimal sample complexity upper bound, while LATS shows asymptotic optimality up to novel constraint-dependent constants. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with different reward distributions and constraints that validate efficient performance of LATS and LAGEX.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinye Chen, Erin Carson, Cheng Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to avoid obvious drifting during forecasting tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive forecasting capability compared to recent SOTA time series forecasting results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.

<p>Abstract: We present methods and applications for the development of digital twins (DT) for urban traffic management. While the majority of studies on the DT focus on its ``eyes," which is the emerging sensing and perception like object detection and tracking, what really distinguishes the DT from a traditional simulator lies in its ``brain," the prediction and decision making capabilities of extracting patterns and making informed decisions from what has been seen and perceived. In order to add value to urban transportation management, DTs need to be powered by artificial intelligence and complement with low-latency high-bandwidth sensing and networking technologies, in other words, cyberphysical systems. This paper can be a pointer to help researchers and practitioners identify challenges and opportunities for the development of DTs; a bridge to initiate conversations across disciplines; and a road map to exploiting potentials of DTs for diverse urban transportation applications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Karpekov, Archith Iyer, Sourish Gunesh Dhekane, Sonia Chernova, Thomas Pl\"otz</p>
<p>Abstract: Smart homes equipped with ambient sensors offer a transformative approach to continuous health monitoring and assisted living. Traditional research in this domain primarily focuses on Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which relies on mapping sensor data to a closed set of predefined activity labels. However, the fixed granularity of these labels often constrains their practical utility, failing to capture the subtle, household-specific nuances essential, for example, for tracking individual health over time. To address this, we propose DISCOVER, a framework for discovering and annotating Patterns of Daily Living (PDL) - fine-grained, recurring sequences of sensor events that emerge directly from a resident's unique routines. DISCOVER utilizes a self-supervised feature extraction and representation-aware clustering pipeline, supported by a custom visualization interface that enables experts to interpret and label discovered patterns with minimal effort. Our evaluation across multiple smart-home environments demonstrates that DISCOVER identifies cohesive behavioral clusters with high inter-rater agreement while achieving classification performance comparable to fully-supervised baselines using only 0.01% of the labels. Beyond reducing annotation overhead, DISCOVER establishes a foundation for longitudinal analysis. By grounding behavior in a resident's specific environment rather than rigid semantic categories, our framework facilitates the observation of within-person habitual drift. This capability positions the system as a potential tool for identifying subtle behavioral indicators associated with early-stage cognitive decline in future longitudinal studies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nimet Beyza Bozdag, Shuhaib Mehri, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-T\"ur</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Beyond the concern of how LLMs persuade others, their own susceptibility to persuasion poses a critical alignment challenge, raising questions about robustness, safety, and adherence to ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasiveness and susceptibility to persuasion in multi-agent interactions. Our framework offers a scalable alternative to the costly and time-intensive human annotation process typically used to study persuasion in LLMs. PMIYC automatically conducts multi-turn conversations between Persuader and Persuadee agents, measuring both the effectiveness of and susceptibility to persuasion. Our comprehensive evaluation spans a diverse set of LLMs and persuasion settings (e.g., subjective and misinformation scenarios). We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and demonstrate alignment with human assessments from prior studies. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xian-Rong Zhang, Yue-Jiao Gong, Yuan-Ting Zhong, Ting Huang, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In many-task optimization scenarios, surrogate models are valuable for mitigating the computational burden of repeated fitness evaluations across tasks. This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed sentiment analysis, yet balancing accuracy, efficiency, and explainability remains a critical challenge. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of DeepSeek-R1--an open-source reasoning model--against OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. We test the full 671B model and its distilled variants, systematically documenting few-shot learning curves. Our experiments show DeepSeek-R1 achieves a 91.39\% F1 score on 5-class sentiment and 99.31\% accuracy on binary tasks with just 5 shots, an eightfold improvement in few-shot efficiency over GPT-4o. Architecture-specific distillation effects emerge, where a 32B Qwen2.5-based model outperforms the 70B Llama-based variant by 6.69 percentage points. While its reasoning process reduces throughput, DeepSeek-R1 offers superior explainability via transparent, step-by-step traces, establishing it as a powerful, interpretable open-source alternative.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangwen Zhang, Qian Zhang, Longfei Han, Qiang Qu, Xiaoming Chen, Weidong Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Collecting real-world vehicle accident videos for autonomous driving research is challenging due to their rarity and complexity. While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are both helpful and harmless is a critical challenge, as overly strict constraints can lead to excessive refusals, while permissive models risk generating harmful content. Existing approaches, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO), attempt to balance these trade-offs but suffer from performance conflicts, limited controllability, and poor extendability. To address these issues, we propose Preference Vector, a novel framework inspired by task arithmetic. Instead of optimizing multiple preferences within a single objective, we train separate models on individual preferences, extract behavior shifts as preference vectors, and dynamically merge them at test time. This modular approach enables fine-grained, user-controllable preference adjustments and facilitates seamless integration of new preferences without retraining. Experiments show that our proposed Preference Vector framework improves helpfulness without excessive conservatism, allows smooth control over preference trade-offs, and supports scalable multi-preference alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shubham Vaishnav, Praveen Kumar Donta, Sindri Magn\'usson</p>
<p>Abstract: IoT networks often face conflicting routing goals such as maximizing packet delivery, minimizing delay, and conserving limited battery energy. These priorities can also change dynamically: for example, an emergency alert requires high reliability, while routine monitoring prioritizes energy efficiency to prolong network lifetime. Existing works, including many deep reinforcement learning approaches, are typically centralized and assume static objectives, making them slow to adapt when preferences shift. We propose a dynamic and fully distributed multi-objective Q-learning routing algorithm that learns multiple per-preference Q-tables in parallel and introduces a novel greedy interpolation policy to act near-optimally for unseen preferences without retraining or central coordination. A theoretical analysis further shows that the optimal value function is Lipschitz-continuous in the preference parameter, ensuring that the proposed greedy interpolation policy yields provably near-optimal behavior. Simulations show that our approach adapts in real time to shifting priorities and achieves up to 80-90\% lower energy consumption and more than 2-5x higher cumulative rewards and packet delivery compared to six baseline protocols, under dynamic and distributed settings. Sensitivity analysis across varying preference window lengths confirms that the proposed DPQ framework consistently achieves higher composite reward than all baseline methods, demonstrating robustness to changes in operating conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soumya Rani Samineni, Durgesh Kalwar, Karthik Valmeekam, Kaya Stechly, Subbarao Kambhampati</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training of large language models (LLMs) has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing claims around improved reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as an MDP, and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP, that characterizes the problem as a contextual bandit, where RL updates naturally collapse into a form of on-policy variant of outcome-driven supervised learning. The two critical structural assumptions include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions with states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the trajectory. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that, due to these simplifying assumptions, GRPO objective reduces to filtered Iterative SFT, an on-policy variant of supervised fine-tuning. Our experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K and Countdown, across a diverse set of model families show that Filtered Iterative SFT, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We also show that these structural assumptions indirectly incentivize RL to generate longer sequences of intermediate tokens which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL incentivizing thinking because it generates longer thinking traces."</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Farshad Noravesh, Reza Haffari, Layki Soon, Arghya Pal</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Attention Networks (GATs) have emerged as powerful models for learning expressive representations from such data by adaptively weighting neighboring nodes through attention mechanisms. However, most existing approaches primarily rely on node attributes and direct neighborhood connections, often overlooking rich structural patterns that capture higher-order topological information crucial for many real-world datasets. In this work, we present the Graph Structure Attention Network (GSAT), a novel extension of GAT that jointly integrates attribute-based and structure-based representations for more effective graph learning. GSAT incorporates structural features derived from anonymous random walks (ARWs) and graph kernels to encode local topological information, enabling attention mechanisms to adapt based on the underlying graph structure. This design enhances the model's ability to discern meaningful relational dependencies within complex data. Comprehensive experiments on standard graph classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that GSAT achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art graph learning methods, highlighting the value of incorporating structural context for representation learning on graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Monoshi Kumar Roy, Simin Chen, Benjamin Steenhoek, Jinjun Peng, Gail Kaiser, Baishakhi Ray, Wei Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about code semantics is essential for enhancing code LLMs' abilities to solve real-world software engineering (SE) tasks. Although several code reasoning benchmarks exist, most rely on synthetic datasets or educational coding problems and focus on coarse-grained reasoning tasks such as input/output prediction, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating LLMs in practical SE contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose CodeSense, the first benchmark that makes available a spectrum of fine-grained code reasoning tasks concerned with the software engineering of real-world code. We collected Python, C and Java software projects from real-world repositories. We executed tests from these repositories, collected their execution traces, and constructed a ground truth dataset for fine-grained semantic reasoning tasks. We then performed comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show a clear performance gap for the models to handle fine-grained reasoning tasks. Although prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought and in-context learning helped, the lack of code semantics in LLMs fundamentally limits models' capabilities of code reasoning. Besides dataset, benchmark and evaluation, our work produced an execution tracing framework and tool set that make it easy to collect ground truth for fine-grained SE reasoning tasks, offering a strong basis for future benchmark construction and model post training.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Goksenin Yuksel, Marcel van Gerven, Kiki van der Heijden</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio foundation models learn general-purpose audio representations that facilitate a wide range of downstream tasks. While the performance of these models has greatly increased for conventional single-channel, dry audio clips, their success in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise is limited. Furthermore, most audio foundation models ignore the spatial dimension of real-world acoustic environments, ruling out tasks involving sound localization. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a general-purpose real-world audio model that employs a multi-channel masked autoencoder to efficiently learn spatial audio representations. We evaluated GRAM and other audio foundation models in a standardized manner on high-quality simulations of naturalistic, spatial acoustic environments as well as recordings of real-world environments and release these two complementary benchmark task suites: NatHEAR and RealSELD. Our results demonstrate that GRAM outperforms all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models on NatHEAR and the clean, single-channel version HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also shows state-of-the-art localization performance in simulated environments and generalizes efficiently to real-world recordings in RealSELD. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advance toward robust spatial audio foundation models for real-world environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Annabelle Sujun Tang, Christopher Priebe, Rohan Mahapatra, Lianhui Qin, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh</p>
<p>Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating a structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mattie Ji, Amauri H. Souza, Vikas Garg</p>
<p>Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than PH and spectral information on graphs alone. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinyoung Park, Jeehye Na, Jinyoung Kim, Hyunwoo J. Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success using a PPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with group-normalized rewards. However, the effectiveness of GRPO in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we explore GRPO and identify two issues that hinder effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) vanishing advantage. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO loss function as a regression task that directly predicts the advantage in GRPO, eliminating the need for safeguards such as clipping and min operations. This directly aligns the model with the advantages, providing guidance to prefer better outputs. The difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy augments input prompts/videos to target solvable difficulty levels, enabling diverse reward signals. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Joydeep Chandra, Aleksandr Algazinov, Satyam Kumar Navneet, Rim El Filali, Matt Laing, Andrew Hanna, Yong Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era of AI-generated misinformation flooding the web, existing tools struggle to empower users with nuanced, transparent assessments of content credibility. They often default to binary (true/false) classifications without contextual justifications, leaving users vulnerable to disinformation. We address this gap by introducing TRACE: Transparent Reliability Assessment with Contextual Explanations, a unified framework that performs two key tasks: (1) it assigns a fine-grained, continuous reliability score (from 0.1 to 1.0) to web content, and (2) it generates a contextual explanation for its assessment. The core of TRACE is the TrueGL-1B model, fine-tuned on a novel, large-scale dataset of over 140,000 articles. This dataset's primary contribution is its annotation with 35 distinct continuous reliability scores, created using a Human-LLM co-creation and data poisoning paradigm. This method overcomes the limitations of binary-labeled datasets by populating the mid-ranges of reliability. In our evaluation, TrueGL-1B consistently outperforms other small-scale LLM baselines and rule-based approaches on key regression metrics, including MAE, RMSE, and R2. The model's high accuracy and interpretable justifications make trustworthy information more accessible. To foster future research, our code and model are made publicly available here: github.com/zade90/TrueGL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mehul Bafna, Siddhant anand Jadhav, David Sweet</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has traditionally solved black-box problems where function evaluation is expensive and, therefore, observations are few. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in applying BO to problems where function evaluation is cheaper and observations are more plentiful. In this regime, scaling to many observations $N$ is impeded by Gaussian-process (GP) surrogates: GP hyperparameter fitting scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ (reduced to roughly $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ in modern implementations), and it is repeated at every BO iteration. Many methods improve scaling at acquisition time, but hyperparameter fitting still scales poorly, making it the bottleneck. We propose Epistemic Nearest Neighbors (ENN), a lightweight alternative to GPs that estimates function values and uncertainty (epistemic and aleatoric) from $K$-nearest-neighbor observations. ENN scales as $\mathcal{O}(N)$ for both fitting and acquisition. Our BO method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the GP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson-sampling acquisition with $\mathrm{UCB} = \mu(x) + \sigma(x)$. For the special case of noise-free problems, we can omit fitting altogether by replacing $\mathrm{UCB}$ with a non-dominated sort over $\mu(x)$ and $\sigma(x)$. We show empirically that TuRBO-ENN reduces proposal time (i.e., fitting time + acquisition time) by one to two orders of magnitude compared to TuRBO at up to 50,000 observations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepak Kumar Panda, Weisi Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples; however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate. Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI), man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Intern\`o, Robert Geirhos, Markus Olhofer, Sunny Liu, Barbara Hammer, David Klindt</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyi Liu, Shuang Li, Eric Cousineau, Siyuan Feng, Benjamin Burchfiel, Shuran Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding and predicting dynamics of the physical world can enhance a robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of generated videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. Through this geometric supervision, the model learns a shared 3D scene representation, enabling it to generate spatio-temporally aligned future video sequences from novel viewpoints given a single RGB-D image per view, and without relying on camera poses as input. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, yielding robot manipulation policies that generalize well to novel camera viewpoints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yizhou Wang, Song Mao, Yang Chen, Yufan Shen, Yinqiao Yan, Pinlong Cai, Ding Wang, Guohang Yan, Zhi Yu, Xuming Hu, Botian Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly integrate multiple vision encoders to improve performance on various benchmarks, assuming that diverse pretraining objectives yield complementary visual signals. However, we show this assumption often fails in practice. Through systematic encoder masking across representative multi encoder MLLMs, we find that performance typically degrades gracefully and sometimes even improves when selected encoders are masked, revealing pervasive encoder redundancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce two principled metrics: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR), which measures an encoders marginal contribution in the presence of others, and the Information Gap (IG), which captures heterogeneity in encoder utility within a model. Using these tools, we observe (i) strong specialization on tasks like OCR and Chart, where a single encoder can dominate with a CUR greater than 90%, (ii) high redundancy on general VQA and knowledge-based tasks, where encoders are largely interchangeable, (iii) instances of detrimental encoders with negative CUR. Notably, masking specific encoders can yield up to 16% higher accuracy on a specific task category and 3.6% overall performance boost compared to the full model.Furthermore, single and dual encoder variants recover over 90% of baseline on most non OCR tasks. Our analysis challenges the more encoders are better heuristic in MLLMs and provides actionable diagnostics for developing more efficient and effective multimodal architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bogdan Kulynych, Juan Felipe Gomez, Georgios Kaissis, Jamie Hayes, Borja Balle, Flavio P. Calmon, Jean Louis Raisaro</p>
<p>Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work, we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary, including worst-case, levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., an accuracy increase from 52% to 70% in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification, attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Berkant Turan, Suhrab Asadulla, David Steinmann, Kristian Kersting, Wolfgang Stammer, Sebastian Pokutta</p>
<p>Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, expressive concept encodings effectively allow to translate such data into interpretable concepts but are often utilised in the context of low-capacity linear predictors. In this work, we push towards real-world verifiability by combining the strengths of both approaches. We introduce Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified framework combining PVGs for formal verifiability with concept encodings to handle complex, high-dimensional inputs in an interpretable way. NCV achieves this by utilizing recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these encodings, which a verifier, implemented as a nonlinear predictor, uses exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms classic concept-based models and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex datasets and helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV as a promising step toward concept-level, verifiable AI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Normative theories allow one to elicit key parts of a ML algorithm from first principles, which is crucial at a time of championed scrutiny for ML work. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) cleverly bypasses reward modeling by making an explicit link with a specific normative model of human choice. Our paper elevates this connection to the full generality of DPO's normative framework. Getting there requires reworking human choice theory's textbook path for a better RLHF/ML fit. It elevates the connection to a remarkably broad viewpoint on preference optimization, considering the current panorama of DPO follow-ups. It also unveils unexpected riches for ML, chief among which the support for non-convex losses, the fact that any compliant ML analytical choice can be embedded with any human choice model, and a normative framework's umbrella wide enough to safeguard DPO's extensions (margins, length correction, ...). A toy experiment ``far away'' from the DPO crowd is given.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components: document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28 languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.</p>

Traditional language modeling is an intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple ``futures'' may be equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and the Winner-Takes-All loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through Low-Rank Adaptation. We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying MCL to language modeling, assuming the data is generated from a mixture of distributions. We illustrate the proposed approach using mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with experiments on visual and audio captioning, as well as machine translation, that our method achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs. The accompanying code and a general-purpose package for applying LoRA-MCL to a wide range of language models are made available.</p>

<p>Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. Furthermore, ASR-derived utterance timestamps provide access to pause dynamics, which are thought to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. Yet, their added value beyond semantic measures remains insufficiently explored. In this study, we evaluated a scalable multimodal framework that integrates pause features with semantic coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries (AVH), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY), and dream narratives (PsyCL). Pause-related features were evaluated alongside established coherence measures using support vector regression to predict clinical FTD scores. Models using pause features alone robustly predict manually rated FTD severity consistently across datasets. Integrating pause features with semantic coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to coherence-only models, with late fusion yielding the most robust and consistent gains in all three datasets. On average across datasets, Spearman correlation increased from \r{ho} = 0.413 for semantic-only models to \r{ho} = 0.455 with late fusion. The performance gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all contexts, though the nature of the most informative pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These findings suggest that both pause dynamics and semantic coherence reflect complementary aspects of thought disorganization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Wu, Weihao Xuan, Ximing Lu, Mingjie Liu, Yi Dong, Zaid Harchaoui, Yejin Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances highlight Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing LLMs' capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether the current practice of RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or mainly amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows, thereby improving precision. This study presents an empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the limits of RLVR. We examine how RLVR can operate as a support-constrained optimization mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions, remaining constrained by the base model's initial distribution. We also identify an entropy-reward trade-off: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while RLVR consistently improves \texttt{pass@1}, \textit{the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets}, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy, it results in greater uncertainty at each generation step and declining answer-level entropy. This indicates that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, we reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash requires future innovations that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.</p>

<p>Abstract: On-device skin lesion analysis is constrained by the compute and energy cost of conventional CNN inference and by the need to update models as new patient data become available. Neuromorphic processors provide event-driven sparse computation and support on-chip incremental learning, yet deployment is often hindered by CNN-to-SNN conversion failures, including non-spike-compatible operators and accuracy degradation under class imbalance. We propose QANA, a quantization-aware CNN backbone embedded in an end-to-end pipeline engineered for conversion-stable neuromorphic execution. QANA replaces conversion-fragile components with spike-compatible transformations by bounding intermediate activations and aligning normalization with low-bit quantization, reducing conversion-induced distortion that disproportionately impacts rare classes. Efficiency is achieved through Ghost-based feature generation under tight FLOP budgets, while spatially-aware efficient channel attention and squeeze-and-excitation recalibrate channels without heavy global operators that are difficult to map to spiking cores. The resulting quantized projection head produces SNN-ready logits and enables incremental updates on edge hardware without full retraining or data offloading. On HAM10000, QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 91.0% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.5 percentage points in Top-1 accuracy (a 4.0% relative gain) and by 12.0 points in macro F1 (a 15.2% relative gain). On a clinical dataset, QANA achieves 90.8% Top-1 accuracy and 81.7% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.2 points in Top-1 accuracy (a 3.7% relative gain) and by 3.6 points in macro F1 (a 4.6% relative gain). When deployed on BrainChip Akida, QANA runs in 1.5 ms per image with 1.7 mJ per image, corresponding to 94.6% lower latency and 99.0% lower energy than its GPU-based CNN implementation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Taeyoung Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for solver operators for various functional problems, yet their stability, generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present a systematic effective field theory analysis of FNOs in an infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high frequency modes that are otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this frequency transfer. For wide networks, we derive explicit criticality conditions on the weight initialization ensemble that ensure small input perturbations maintain a uniform scale across depth, and we confirm experimentally that the theoretically predicted ratio of kernel perturbations matches the measurements. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for hyperparameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning in FNOs. Finally, we translate the criticality theory into a practical criterion-matched initialization (calibration) procedure; on a standard PDEBench Burgers benchmark, the calibrated FNO exhibits markedly more stable optimization, faster convergence, and improved test error relative to a vanilla FNO.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hiskias Dingeto, Taeyoun Kwon, Dasol Choi, Bodam Kim, DongGeon Lee, Haon Park, JaeHoon Lee, Jongho Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that manipulates state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method embeds harmful payloads as subtle perturbations into audio inputs that remain intelligible to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based white-box optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to jailbreak the target model and elicit harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use gradient-based optimization to embed subtle perturbations into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Our method achieves average attack success rates of 60-78% across two benchmarks and five multimodal LLMs, validated by multiple evaluation frameworks. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating multimodal AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar, Yang Li, Qiyang Liu, Shashank Srivastava, Junier Oliva</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce universal neural likelihood inference (UNLI): enabling a single model to provide data-grounded, conditional likelihood predictions for arbitrary targets given any collection of observed features, across diverse domains and tasks. To achieve UNLI over heterogeneous tabular data, we develop the Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant Reasoning Engine (ASPIRE) model. Our design addresses critical gaps in existing approaches to merge semantic-understanding capabilities and generalised numerical feature reasoning within a zero-shot capable framework. Trained on over 1,400 real diverse datasets spanning various domains, ASPIRE achieves 15\% higher F1 scores and 85\% lower RMSE than existing tabular foundation models in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Lastly, this work introduces open-world active feature acquisition, where we leverage the UNLI capabilities of ASPIRE to adeptly determine next feature-values to observe to improve inference time prediction accuracies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gilad Abiri</p>
<p>Abstract: We have convinced ourselves that the way to make AI safe is to make it unsafe. Since 2022, policymakers worldwide have embraced the Regulation Sacrifice - the belief that dismantling safety oversight will deliver security through AI dominance. Fearing China or USA will gain advantage, nations rush to eliminate safeguards that might slow progress. This Essay reveals the fatal flaw: though AI poses national security challenges, the solution demands stronger regulatory frameworks, not weaker ones. A race without guardrails breeds shared danger, not competitive strength. The Regulation Sacrifice makes three false promises. First, it promises durable technological leads. But AI capabilities spread rapidly - performance gaps between U.S. and Chinese systems collapsed from 9 percent to 2 percent in thirteen months. When advantages evaporate in months, sacrificing permanent safety for temporary speed makes no sense. Second, it promises deregulation accelerates innovation. The opposite often proves true. Companies report well-designed governance streamlines development. Investment flows toward regulated markets. Clear rules reduce uncertainty; uncertain liability creates paralysis. Environmental standards did not kill the auto industry; they created Tesla and BYD. Third, enhanced national security through deregulation actually undermines security across all timeframes. Near term: it hands adversaries information warfare tools. Medium term: it democratizes bioweapon capabilities. Long term: it guarantees deployment of uncontrollable AGI systems. The Regulation Sacrifice persists because it serves powerful interests, not security. Tech companies prefer freedom to accountability. Politicians prefer simple stories to complex truths. This creates mutually assured deregulation, where each nation's sprint for advantage guarantees collective vulnerability. The only way to win is not to play.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rapheal Huang (Yuming), Weilong Guo</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, traditionally requiring high-quality large-scale data and extensive training. Recent works reveal a very appealing Less-Is-More phenomenon where very small, carefully curated high-quality datasets match resource-intensive approaches. In this work, we further systematically relax their quality constraints by adding controlled noise via persona context relevance and comparing datasets of different qualities. Counterintuitively, we find that mixing relevant and irrelevant contexts consistently across training and inference stages yields optimal results -- a phenomenon we term training-testing co-design. Dataset quality comparisons show that high-quality data benefits weaker models on easy questions, while low-quality data achieves higher scores on hard questions with capable models. Across our experiments, reasoning performance is linked to reasoning efficiency. We, for the first time, found adding noisy and irrelevant contexts into queries can improve reasoning efficiency without any prices and targeted designs. Building on these insights, we propose Input-Time Scaling: applying small, low-quality data to capable models with training-testing co-design. This maintains Less-Is-More while further removing labor-intensive quality curation and improving reasoning effectiveness and efficiency, making the approach more applicable and affordable. Our method achieves 76.7% pass@1 on AIME24/25 using Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and 90.0%/80.0% with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B -- state-of-the-art among Qwen2.5-32B variants. We are open-sourcing our datasets, pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marie Mirsch (RWTH Aachen University, Germany), Laila Wegner (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands), Jonas Strube (RWTH Aachen University, Germany), Carmen Leicht-Scholten (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)</p>
<p>Abstract: People's experiences of discrimination are often shaped by multiple intersecting factors, yet algorithmic fairness research rarely reflects this complexity. While intersectionality offers tools for understanding how forms of oppression interact, current approaches to intersectional algorithmic fairness tend to focus on narrowly defined demographic subgroups. These methods contribute important insights but risk oversimplifying social reality and neglecting structural inequalities. In this paper, we outline how a substantive approach to intersectional algorithmic fairness can reorient this research and practice. In particular, we propose Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic Fairness, extending Green's (2022) notion of substantive algorithmic fairness with insights from intersectional feminist theory. Aiming to provide as actionable guidance as possible, our approach is articulated as ten desiderata to guide the design, assessment, and deployment of algorithmic systems that address systemic inequities while mitigating harms to intersectionally marginalized communities. Rather than prescribing fixed operationalizations, these desiderata invite AI practitioners and experts to reflect on assumptions of neutrality, the use of protected attributes, the inclusion of multiply marginalized groups, and the transformative potential of algorithmic systems. By bridging computational and social science perspectives, the approach emphasizes that fairness cannot be separated from social context, and that in some cases, principled non-deployment may be necessary.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Huy Le, Nhat Chung, Tung Kieu, Jingkang Yang, Ngan Le</p>
<p>Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Silver, Thangarajah Akilan</p>
<p>Abstract: Falls among seniors are a major public health issue. Existing solutions using wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and RGB-based vision systems face challenges in reliability, user compliance, and practicality. Studies indicate that stakeholders, such as older adults and eldercare facilities, prefer non-wearable, passive, privacy-preserving, and real-time fall detection systems that require no user interaction. This study proposes an advanced thermal fall detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures. Among them, BiConvLSTM achieved state-of-the-art performance with a ROC-AUC of $99.7\%$ on the TSF dataset and demonstrated robust results on TF-66, a newly emerged, diverse, and privacy-preserving benchmark. These results highlight the generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable, high-performance solutions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Woongkyu Lee, Junhee Cho, Jungwook Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation from single-function tasks to competitive-programming problems, but existing multi-agent solutions either rely on costly large-scale (>30B) models or collapse when downsized to small open-source models. We present MapCoder-Lite, a framework for distilling the complex reasoning of large, multi-agent coding systems into a single 7B model. Our contribution is a novel, three-pillar methodology that synergistically generates, refines, and encodes multi-agent knowledge: (i) pass-based trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and reduces failures in debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction with global feedback strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from 13.2% to 28.3%), eliminates all format failures, while reducing GPU memory and token-generation time by 4x compared to a 32B model. It also achieves over 10% gains on simpler coding benchmarks, demonstrating broad improvements beyond competitive programming. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jungsoo Park, Ethan Mendes, Gabriel Stanovsky, Alan Ritter</p>
<p>Abstract: Progress in large language models is increasingly constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: benchmarks must be built and models run before iteration can begin. We investigate whether evaluation outcomes can be forecast before any experiments are conducted. Specifically, we study text-only performance prediction, where models estimate performance from task descriptions and experimental configurations alone, without access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. We scrape task and configuration descriptions from arXiv, yielding 2,290 instances covering 1,519 papers, and construct a test split using papers published after the evaluated models' knowledge cutoff. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: reasoning models achieve a non-trivial forecasting skill reaching mean absolute error as low as 9.9 at high-confidence thresholds. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter resource allocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aymen Bouguerra, Daniel Montoya, Alexandra Gomez-Villa, Chokri Mraidha, Fabio Arnez</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have revolutionized zero-shot classification and safety-critical tasks, including Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, their high computational cost hinders efficient real-world deployment. While quantization is a standard solution for efficiency, its broader impact on reliability metrics beyond simple Top-1 accuracy remains critically under-explored. In this study, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of VLM quantization across a comprehensive experimental suite of over 700k evaluation runs with varying configurations. We find that, contrary to the assumption that quantization's noise degrades performance, it can simultaneously improve accuracy, calibration, OOD detection, and robustness to noise, though not to covariate shift or spurious correlations. We leverage these counterintuitive findings to characterize the mechanics of quantization beyond simple regularization: we show that quantization dampens high-rank spectral components, compelling the model to rely more heavily on robust, low-rank features. Ultimately, this spectral filtering effect drives the observed improvements in generalization and noise tolerance, establishing a pathway to deploy faster, more reliable VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaorui Shi, Yuxin Chen, Siyuan Wang, Sihang Li, Hengxing Cai, Qi Gu, Xiang Wang, An Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering, where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens. Existing works equip large language models with a memory buffer that is dynamically updated via a linear document scan, also known as the "memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it suffers from pruning of latent evidence, information loss through overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these challenges, we present ReMemR1, which integrates the mechanism of memory retrieval into the memory update process, enabling the agent to selectively callback historical memories for non-linear reasoning. To further strengthen training, we propose a multi-level reward design, which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate information degradation, improve supervision, and support complex multi-hop reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMemR1 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-context question answering while incurring negligible computational overhead, validating its ability to trade marginal cost for robust long-context reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our method supports causal interventions on target attributes and consistently propagates their effects to causal dependents while preserving the core identity of the image. Unlike prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling with two attribute-regularization strategies: (i) prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and (ii) a conditioned token contrastive loss that disentangles attribute factors and reduces spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including up to a 91% reduction in MAE on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and up to an 87% reduction in FID on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI generation. These results demonstrate robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.

<p>Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) with audio-language models (ALMs) remains vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time, leading to performance degradation in out-of-domain scenarios. Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning, limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight, training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peijun Zhu, Ning Yang, Baoliang Tian, Jiayu Wei, Weihao Zhang, Haijun Zhang, Pin Lv</p>
<p>Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yubo Li, Ramayya Krishnan, Rema Padman</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rabiya Khalid, Evangelos Pournaras</p>
<p>Abstract: The growing electricity demand and use of smart appliances are placing pressure on power grids, making efficient energy management more important than ever. The existing energy management systems often prioritize system efficiency (balanced energy demand and supply) at the expense of consumer comfort. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel decentralized multi-agent coordination-based demand-side management system. The proposed system enables individual agents to coordinate for demand-side energy optimization while improving consumer comfort and maintaining system efficiency. A key innovation of this work is the introduction of a slot exchange mechanism, where agents first receive optimized appliance-level energy consumption schedules and then coordinate with each other to adjust these schedules through slot exchanges to improve their comfort even when agents show non-altruistic behaviour. It also scales well with large populations and promotes fairness by balancing satisfaction levels across consumers. For performance evaluation, a real-world dataset is used, and the results demonstrate that the proposed slot exchange mechanism increases consumer comfort and fairness without raising system inefficiency cost, making it a practical and scalable solution for future smart grids.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michele Caprio, Siu Lun Chau, Krikamol Muandet</p>
<p>Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem, and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhao Tong, Chunlin Gong, Yimeng Gu, Haichao Shi, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Xiao-Yu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Online fake news profoundly distorts public judgment and erodes trust in social platforms. While existing detectors achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets, they remain notably vulnerable to malicious comments designed specifically to induce misclassification. This evolving threat landscape necessitates detection systems that simultaneously prioritize predictive accuracy and structural robustness. However, current detectors often fail to generalize across diverse and novel comment attack patterns. To bridge this gap, we propose AdComment, an adaptive adversarial training framework for robustness enhancement against diverse malicious comments. Based on cognitive psychology, we categorize adversarial comments into Fact Distortion, Logical Confusion, and Emotional Manipulation, and leverage LLMs to synthesize diverse, category-specific perturbations. Central to our framework is an InfoDirichlet Resampling (IDR) mechanism that dynamically adjusts malicious comment proportions during training, thereby steering optimization toward the model's most susceptible regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, improving the F1 scores by 17.9%, 14.5% and 9.0%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Arip Asadulaev, Semyon Semenov, Abduragim Shtanchaev, Eric Moulines, Fakhri Karray, Martin Takac</p>
<p>Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models typically induce \emph{V-shaped} flows: each sample travels independently along a nearly straight trajectory from the prior to the data. Although effective, this independent movement overlooks the hierarchical structures that exist in real-world data. To address this, we introduce \emph{Y-shaped generative flows}, a framework in which samples travel together along shared pathways before branching off to target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is theoretically justified, yet remains practical, requiring only minimal modifications to standard velocity-driven models. We implement this through a scalable, neural network-based training objective. Experiments on synthetic, image, and biological datasets demonstrate that our method recovers hierarchy-aware structures, improves distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reaches targets in fewer steps.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francesco Giarrusso, Olga E. Sorokoletova, Vincenzo Suriani, Daniele Nardi</p>
<p>Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize risk categories rather than jailbreaking techniques. To advance the understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a structured red-teaming challenge. The outcomes of our experiments are fourfold. First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of jailbreak strategies that systematically consolidates techniques previously studied in isolation and harmonizes existing, partially overlapping classifications with explicit cross-references to prior categorizations. The taxonomy organizes jailbreak strategies into seven mechanism-oriented families: impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we benchmarked GPT-5 as a judge for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues, annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional safeguards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hezam Albagami, Haitian Wang, Xinyu Wang, Muhammad Ibrahim, Zainy M. Malakan, Abdullah M. Alqamdi, Mohammed H. Alghamdi, Ajmal Mian</p>
<p>Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps enable city planning and change detection, which is essential for municipal compliance, map maintenance, and asset monitoring, including both built structures and urban greenery. Conventional Digital Surface Model (DSM) and image differencing are sensitive to vertical bias and viewpoint mismatch, while original point cloud or voxel models require large memory, assume perfect alignment, and degrade thin structures. We propose an uncertainty-aware, object-centric method for city-scale LiDAR-based change detection. Our method aligns data from different time periods using multi-resolution Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) and a point-to-plane Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method, normalizes elevation, and computes a per-point level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate change decisions. Geometry-based associations are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and optimized using class-constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle split-merge cases. Tiled processing bounds memory and preserves narrow ground changes, while instance-level decisions integrate overlap, displacement, and volumetric differences under local detection gating. We perform experiments on a Subiaco (Western Australia) dataset captured in 2023 and again in 2025. Our method achieves 95.3% accuracy, 90.8% mF1, and 82.9% mIoU, improving over the strongest baseline, Triplet KPConv, by 0.3, 0.6, and 1.1 points, respectively.

<p>Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE) practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence, including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering 2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and software products. The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for framing future research within this rapidly evolving area.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations extracted from tabular foundation models (TabPFN, TabICL and TabSTAR) alongside classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer and a sphere model) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple feature engineering methods achieve comparable or superior performance while requiring significantly less computational resources than tabular foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanxi Li, Ruocheng Shan</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, yet their reliance on natural language prompts exposes them to prompt injection attacks. In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaoshan Wu, Yifei Yu, Xiaoyang Lyu, Yihua Huang, Bo Wang, Baoheng Zhang, Zhongrui Wang, Xiaojuan Qi</p>
<p>Abstract: Robust 3D geometry estimation from videos is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, SLAM, and 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization. Our method enables robust geometry estimation in challenging dynamic low-light scenes without requiring retraining on night-time data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06655">GSAE: Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders for Robust LLM Safety Steering</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jehyeok Yeon, Federico Cinus, Yifan Wu, Luca Luceri</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face critical safety challenges, as they can be manipulated to generate harmful content through adversarial prompts and jailbreak attacks. Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K). Robustness experiments further show generalization across LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families and resilience against jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN), consistently maintaining >= 90% refusal of harmful content.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuldip Singh Atwal, Dieter Pfoser, Daniel Rothbart</p>
<p>Abstract: Ongoing armed conflict in Sudan highlights the need for rapid monitoring of conflict-related fire damage. Recent advances in deep learning and high-frequency satellite imagery enable near--real-time assessment of active fires and burn scars in war zones. This study presents a near--real-time monitoring approach using a lightweight Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)-based model integrated with 4-band Planet Labs imagery at 3 m spatial resolution. We demonstrate that conflict-related fire damage can be detected with minimal delay using accessible, commercially available satellite data. To achieve this, we adapt a VAE-based model, originally designed for 10-band imagery, to operate effectively on high-resolution 4-band inputs. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner to learn compact latent representations of nominal land-surface conditions and identify fire-affected areas by quantifying changes between temporally paired latent embeddings. Performance is evaluated across five case studies in Sudan and compared against a cosine-distance baseline computed between temporally paired image tiles using precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving higher recall and F1-scores while maintaining strong precision in highly imbalanced fire-detection scenarios. Experiments with 8-band imagery and temporal image sequences yield only marginal performance gains over single 4-band inputs, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight approach for scalable, near--real-time conflict monitoring.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurate and efficient discrete video tokenization is essential for long video sequences processing. Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Unifying the vast heterogeneity of brain signals into a single foundation model is a longstanding challenge in neuroscience. Yet, even as large-scale pretraining becomes feasible, the field lacks principled guidance on how to scale electrophysiological foundation models under realistic data and compute constraints. We present the first systematic scaling law analysis spanning both EEG and iEEG, and uncover a distinct data-constrained characteristic. Unlike language modeling, performance in electrophysiology is dominated first by data scale, followed by training duration (epochs), with model parameter count playing a subordinate role under fixed compute budgets. This challenges the prevailing "bigger is better" heuristic derived from large language models. Building on these insights, we introduce DIVER-1, a family of models trained on the largest and most diverse corpus to date: 59.3k hours (54k EEG and 5.3k iEEG) across 1.6 million channel-hours from more than 17.7k subjects, scaling up to 1.82 billion parameters. By prioritizing data diversity and training horizons over mere parameter expansion, DIVER-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across established benchmarks. Our work provides both a powerful generalist model and actionable guidelines for efficient development of future neuro-AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: PINNs enhance scientific computing by incorporating physical laws into neural network structures, leading to significant advancements in scientific computing. However, PINNs struggle with multi-scale and high-frequency problems due to pathological gradient flow and spectral bias, which severely limit their predictive power. By combining an enhanced network architecture with a dynamically adaptive weighting mechanism featuring upper-bound constraints, we propose the Dynamic Balancing Adaptive Weighting Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (DBAW-PIKAN). The proposed method effectively mitigates gradient-related failure modes and overcomes bottlenecks in function representation. Compared to baseline models, the proposed method accelerates the convergence process and improves solution accuracy by at least an order of magnitude without introducing additional computational complexity. Numerical results on the Klein-Gordon, Burgers, and Helmholtz equations demonstrate that DBAW-PIKAN achieves superior accuracy and generalization performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding agents promises to accelerate software development, but their impact on generated code reproducibility remains largely unexplored. This paper presents an empirical study investigating whether LLM-generated code can be executed successfully in a clean environment with only OS packages and using only the dependencies that the model specifies. We evaluate three state-of-the-art LLM coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini) across 300 projects generated from 100 standardized prompts in Python, JavaScript, and Java. We introduce a three-layer dependency framework (distinguishing between claimed, working, and runtime dependencies) to quantify execution reproducibility. Our results show that only 68.3% of projects execute out-of-the-box, with substantial variation across languages (Python 89.2%, Java 44.0%). We also find a 13.5 times average expansion from declared to actual runtime dependencies, revealing significant hidden dependencies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, multimodal large language models continue to struggle with visual mathematical problem solving. Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\Rightarrow$internalization$\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow.</p>

Guided by this framework, we introduce a system that enables large audio-language models (LALMs) to understand and reason about the complex acoustic world.
  Our system endows LALMs with universal spatial understanding through four key innovations: (1) A scalable simulation pipeline that synthesizes high-quality First-Order-Ambisonics(FOA) data; (2) A unified model framework that integrates universal spatial encoding with a dense hybrid projection mechanism to bridge the modality gap; (3) A progressive training curriculum that evolves from representation alignment to reinforcement learning-based reasoning; and (4) A comprehensive benchmark for audio scene analysis (ASA) designed to rigorously evaluate atomic perception, relational integration, and cognitive reasoning capabilities, on which our model demonstrates comparatively strong capability for spatial understanding. Our work provides a clear pathway for leveraging the powerful reasoning abilities of LALMs towards holistic ASA, advancing from "mono" semantic recognition to spatial intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hunter McCoy, Zikun Wang, Prashant Pandey</p>
<p>Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a core problem in machine learning and information retrieval applications. GPUs offer a promising path to high-performance ANNS: they provide massive parallelism for distance computations, are readily available, and can co-locate with downstream applications.
  Despite these advantages, current GPU-accelerated ANNS systems face three key limitations. First, real-world applications operate on evolving datasets that require fast batch updates, yet most GPU indices must be rebuilt from scratch when new data arrives. Second, high-dimensional vectors strain memory bandwidth, but current GPU systems lack efficient quantization techniques that reduce data movement without introducing costly random memory accesses. Third, the data-dependent memory accesses inherent to greedy search make overlapping compute and memory difficult, leading to reduced performance.
  We present Jasper, a GPU-native ANNS system with both high query throughput and updatability. Jasper builds on the Vamana graph index and overcomes existing bottlenecks via three contributions: (1) a CUDA batch-parallel construction algorithm that enables lock-free streaming insertions, (2) a GPU-efficient implementation of RaBitQ quantization that reduces memory footprint up to 8x without the random access penalties, and (3) an optimized greedy search kernel that increases compute utilization, resulting in better latency hiding and higher throughput.
  Our evaluation across five datasets shows that Jasper achieves up to 1.93x higher query throughput than CAGRA and achieves up to 80% peak utilization as measured by the roofline model. Jasper's construction scales efficiently and constructs indices an average of 2.4x faster than CAGRA while providing updatability that CAGRA lacks. Compared to BANG, the previous fastest GPU Vamana implementation, Jasper delivers 19-131x faster queries.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yanhua Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongkun Cui, Nana Zhang, Kun Zhu, Qi Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Online financial services constitute an essential component of contemporary web ecosystems, yet their openness introduces substantial exposure to fraud that harms vulnerable users and weakens trust in digital finance. Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well-being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases, and (2) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42% improvement in AUC, 9.74% in F1 and 39.14% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Concept-based interpretability methods like TCAV require clean, well-separated positive and negative examples for each concept. Existing music datasets lack this structure: tags are sparse, noisy, or ill-defined. We introduce ConceptCaps, a dataset of 21k music-caption-tags triplets with explicit labels from a 200-attribute taxonomy. Our pipeline separates semantic modeling from text generation: a VAE learns plausible attribute co-occurrence patterns, a fine-tuned LLM converts attribute lists into professional descriptions, and MusicGen synthesizes corresponding audio. This separation improves coherence and controllability over end-to-end approaches. We validate the dataset through audio-text alignment (CLAP), linguistic quality metrics (BERTScore, MAUVE), and TCAV analysis confirming that concept probes recover musically meaningful patterns.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Zahn, Matt Beton, Simran Chana</p>
<p>Abstract: Biological memory solves a problem that eludes current AI: storing specific episodic facts without corrupting general semantic knowledge. Complementary Learning Systems theory explains this through two subsystems - a fast hippocampal system using sparse, pattern-separated representations for episodes, and a slow neocortical system using distributed representations for statistical regularities. Current AI systems lack this separation, attempting to serve both functions through neural weights alone. We identify the Orthogonality Constraint: reliable memory requires orthogonal keys, but semantic embeddings cannot be orthogonal because training clusters similar concepts together. The result is Semantic Interference (connecting to what cognitive psychologists have long observed in human memory), where neural systems writing facts into shared continuous parameters collapse to near-random accuracy within tens of semantically related facts. Through semantic density (rho), the mean pairwise cosine similarity, we show collapse occurs at N=5 facts (rho > 0.6) or N ~ 20-75 (moderate rho). We validate across modalities: 16,309 Wikipedia facts, scientific measurements (rho = 0.96, 0.02% accuracy at N=10,000), and image embeddings (rho = 0.82, 0.05% at N=2,000). This failure is geometric - no increase in model capacity can overcome interference when keys share semantic overlap. We propose Knowledge Objects (KOs): structured facts with hash-based identity, controlled vocabularies, and explicit version chains. On Wikipedia facts, KO retrieval achieves 45.7% where Modern Hopfield Networks collapse to near-zero; hash-based retrieval maintains 100%. Production systems (Claude Memory, ChatGPT Memory) store unstructured text, causing schema drift (40-70% consistency) and version ambiguity. Knowledge Objects provide the discrete hippocampal component that enables reliable bicameral memory.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saptarshi Roy, Alessandro Rinaldo, Purnamrita Sarkar</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, Rectified flow (RF) has gained considerable popularity largely due to its generation efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which RF automatically adapts to the intrinsic low dimensionality of the support of the target distribution to accelerate sampling. We show that, using a carefully designed choice of the time-discretization scheme and with sufficiently accurate drift estimates, the RF sampler enjoys an iteration complexity of order $O(k/\varepsilon)$ (up to log factors), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. In addition, we show that the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) procedure is equivalent to a stochastic version of RF by establishing a novel connection between these processes and stochastic localization. Building on this connection, we further design a stochastic RF sampler that also adapts to the low-dimensionality of the target distribution under milder requirements on the accuracy of the drift estimates, and also with a specific time schedule. We illustrate with simulations on the synthetic data and text-to-image data experiments the improved performance of the proposed samplers implementing the newly designed time-discretization schedules.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nima Leclerc, Chris Miller, Nicholas Brawand</p>
<p>Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhuonan Wang, Wenjie Yan, Wenqiao Zhang, Xiaohui Song, Jian Ma, Ke Yao, Yibo Yu, Beng Chin Ooi</p>
<p>Abstract: Medical image classification is a core task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), playing a pivotal role in early disease detection, treatment planning, and patient prognosis assessment. In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction. This study provides an effective solution that balances generalizability and reliability for modality-specific medical image classification tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Accurately capturing feature interactions is essential in recommender systems, and recent trends show that scaling up model capacity could be a key driver for next-level predictive performance. While prior work has explored various model architectures to capture multi-granularity feature interactions, relatively little attention has been paid to efficient feature handling and scaling model capacity without incurring excessive inference latency. In this paper, we address this by presenting Zenith, a scalable and efficient ranking architecture that learns complex feature interactions with minimal runtime overhead. Zenith is designed to handle a few high-dimensional Prime Tokens with Token Fusion and Token Boost modules, which exhibits superior scaling laws compared to other state-of-the-art ranking methods, thanks to its improved token heterogeneity. Its real-world effectiveness is demonstrated by deploying the architecture to TikTok Live, a leading online livestreaming platform that attracts billions of users globally. Our A/B test shows that Zenith achieves +1.05%/-1.10% in online CTR AUC and Logloss, and realizes +9.93% gains in Quality Watch Session / User and +8.11% in Quality Watch Duration / User.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ellen Xiaoqing Tan, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Jing Xu, Ping Yu, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Olga Golovneva</p>
<p>Abstract: Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Ni, Weijia Zhang, Fei Wang, Zezhi Shao, Hao Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have inspired time series understanding and reasoning tasks, that enable natural language querying over time series, producing textual analyses of complex temporal dynamics. Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective numerical-visual modality integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a structured alternative to standard MLPs, yet a principled theory for their training dynamics, generalization, and privacy properties remains limited. In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\sqrt{d}/(n\epsilon)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dani Roytburg, Matthew Bozoukov, Matthew Nguyen, Mackenzie Puig-Hall, Narmeen Oozeer</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) favor their own outputs when acting as judges, undermining the integrity of automated post-training and evaluation workflows. However, it is difficult to disentangle which evaluation biases are explained by narcissism versus general experimental confounds, distorting measurements of self-preference bias. We discover a core methodological confound which could reduce measurement error by 89.6%. Specifically, LLM evaluators may deliver self-preferring verdicts when the judge responds to queries which they completed incorrectly themselves; this would be true regardless of whether one of their responses is their own. To decouple self-preference signals from noisy outputs on hard problems, we introduce an Evaluator Quality Baseline, which compares the probability that a judge incorrectly votes for itself against the probability that it votes for an incorrect response from another model. Evaluating this simple baseline on 37,448 queries, only 51% of initial findings retain statistical significance. Finally, we turn towards characterizing the entropy of "easy" versus "hard" evaluation votes from LLM judges. Our corrective baseline enables future research on self-preference by eliminating noisy data from potential solutions. More widely, this work contributes to the growing body of work on cataloging and isolating judge-bias effects.</p>

<p>Abstract: Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs. Code and checkpoints will be released publicly at https://github.com/lucadellalib/dycast.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fang Sheng, Mohammad Noaeen, Zahra Shakeri</p>
<p>Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance threatens healthcare sustainability and motivates low-cost computational discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). De novo peptide generation must optimize antimicrobial activity and safety through low predicted toxicity, but likelihood-trained generators do not enforce these goals explicitly. We introduce ProDCARL, a reinforcement-learning alignment framework that couples a diffusion-based protein generator (EvoDiff OA-DM 38M) with sequence property predictors for AMP activity and peptide toxicity. We fine-tune the diffusion prior on AMP sequences to obtain a domain-aware generator. Top-k policy-gradient updates use classifier-derived rewards plus entropy regularization and early stopping to preserve diversity and reduce reward hacking. In silico experiments show ProDCARL increases the mean predicted AMP score from 0.081 after fine-tuning to 0.178. The joint high-quality hit rate reaches 6.3\% with pAMP $>$0.7 and pTox $<$0.3. ProDCARL maintains high diversity, with $1-$mean pairwise identity equal to 0.929. Qualitative analyses with AlphaFold3 and ProtBERT embeddings suggest candidates show plausible AMP-like structural and semantic characteristics. ProDCARL serves as a candidate generator that narrows experimental search space, and experimental validation remains future work.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziqi Gao, Yaotian Zhu, Qingcheng Zeng, Xu Zhao, Ziqing Wang, Feng Ruan, Kaize Ding</p>
<p>Abstract: Probing studies what information is encoded in a frozen LLM's layer representations by training a lightweight predictor on top of them. Beyond analysis, probes are often used operationally in probe-then-steer pipelines: a learned concept vector is extracted from a probe and injected via additive activation steering by adding it to a layer representation during the forward pass. The effectiveness of this pipeline hinges on estimating concept vectors that are accurate, directionally stable under ablation, and inexpensive to obtain. Motivated by these desiderata, we propose RAPTOR (Ridge-Adaptive Logistic Probe), a simple L2-regularized logistic probe whose validation-tuned ridge strength yields concept vectors from normalized weights. Across extensive experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs and human-written concept datasets, RAPTOR matches or exceeds strong baselines in accuracy while achieving competitive directional stability and substantially lower training cost; these quantitative results are supported by qualitative downstream steering demonstrations. Finally, using the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT), we provide a mechanistic characterization of ridge logistic regression in an idealized Gaussian teacher-student model in the high-dimensional few-shot regime, explaining how penalty strength mediates probe accuracy and concept-vector stability and yielding structural predictions that qualitatively align with trends observed on real LLM embeddings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anxin Guo, Jingwei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</p>

Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems. The resulting model, termed LASS-ODE (\underline{LA}rge-\underline{S}cale \underline{S}mall \underline{ODE}), is pretrained on our $40$GB ODE trajectory collections to enable strong in-domain performance, zero-shot generalization across diverse ODE systems, and additional improvements through fine-tuning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyue Wang, Jiangshan Yu, Kaihua Qin, Dawn Song, Arthur Gervais, Liyi Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has turned blockchains into financial infrastructure, allowing anyone to trade, lend, and build protocols without intermediaries, but this openness exposes pools of value controlled by code. Within five years, the DeFi ecosystem has lost over 15.75B USD to reported exploits. Many exploits arise from permissionless opportunities that any participant can trigger using only public state and standard interfaces, which we call Anyone-Can-Take (ACT) opportunities. Despite on-chain transparency, postmortem analysis remains slow and manual: investigations start from limited evidence, sometimes only a single transaction hash, and must reconstruct the exploit lifecycle by recovering related transactions, contract code, and state dependencies.
  We present TxRay, a Large Language Model (LLM) agentic postmortem system that uses tool calls to reconstruct live ACT attacks from limited evidence. Starting from one or more seed transactions, TxRay recovers the exploit lifecycle, derives an evidence-backed root cause, and generates a runnable, self-contained Proof of Concept (PoC) that deterministically reproduces the incident. TxRay self-checks postmortems by encoding incident-specific semantic oracles as executable assertions.
  To evaluate PoC correctness and quality, we develop PoCEvaluator, an independent agentic execution-and-review evaluator. On 114 incidents from DeFiHackLabs, TxRay produces an expert-aligned root cause and an executable PoC for 105 incidents, achieving 92.11% end-to-end reproduction. Under PoCEvaluator, 98.1% of TxRay PoCs avoid hard-coding attacker addresses, a +22.9pp lift over DeFiHackLabs. In a live deployment, TxRay delivers validated root causes in 40 minutes and PoCs in 59 minutes at median latency. TxRay's oracle-validated PoCs enable attack imitation, improving coverage by 15.6% and 65.5% over STING and APE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haoqiang Kang, Yizhe Zhang, Nikki Lijing Kuang, Yi-An Ma, Lianhui Qin</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods improve LLM reasoning by optimizing discrete Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation; however, exploration in token space often suffers from diversity collapse as policy entropy decreases due to mode elicitation behavior in discrete RL. To mitigate this issue, we propose Latent Diffusion Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning (LaDi-RL), a framework that conducts exploration directly in a continuous latent space, where latent variables encode semantic-level reasoning trajectories. By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziwen Xu, Chenyan Wu, Hengyu Sun, Haiwen Hong, Mengru Wang, Yunzhi Yao, Longtao Huang, Hui Xue, Shumin Deng, Zhixuan Chu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods for controlling large language models (LLMs), including local weight fine-tuning, LoRA-based adaptation, and activation-based interventions, are often studied in isolation, obscuring their connections and making comparison difficult. In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dianyi Wang, Chaofan Ma, Feng Han, Size Wu, Wei Song, Yibin Wang, Zhixiong Zhang, Tianhang Wang, Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Jiaqi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Unified multimodal models often struggle with complex synthesis tasks that demand deep reasoning, and typically treat text-to-image generation and image editing as isolated capabilities rather than interconnected reasoning steps. To address this, we propose UniReason, a unified framework that harmonizes these two tasks through two complementary reasoning paradigms. We incorporate world knowledge-enhanced textual reasoning into generation to infer implicit knowledge, and leverage editing capabilities for fine-grained editing-like visual refinement to further correct visual errors via self-reflection. This approach unifies generation and editing within a shared architecture, mirroring the human cognitive process of planning followed by refinement. We support this framework by systematically constructing a large-scale reasoning-centric dataset (~300k samples) covering five major knowledge domains (e.g., cultural commonsense, physics, etc.) for textual reasoning, alongside an agent-generated corpus for visual refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shihao Wang, Jiahao Chen, Yanqi Pan, Hao Huang, Yichen Hao, Xiangyu Zou, Wen Xia, Wentao Zhang, Haitao Wang, Junhong Li, Chongyang Qiu, Pengfei Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The prefill stage of long-context Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is severely bottlenecked by computational overhead. To mitigate this, recent methods assemble pre-calculated KV caches of retrieved RAG documents (by a user query) and reprocess selected tokens to recover cross-attention between these pre-calculated KV caches. However, we identify a fundamental "crowding-out effect" in current token selection criteria: globally salient but user-query-irrelevant tokens saturate the limited recomputation budget, displacing the tokens truly essential for answering the user query and degrading inference accuracy.
  We propose ProphetKV, a user-query-driven KV Cache reuse method for RAG scenarios. ProphetKV dynamically prioritizes tokens based on their semantic relevance to the user query and employs a dual-stage recomputation pipeline to fuse layer-wise attention metrics into a high-utility set. By ensuring the recomputation budget is dedicated to bridging the informational gap between retrieved context and the user query, ProphetKV achieves high-fidelity attention recovery with minimal overhead. Our extensive evaluation results show that ProphetKV retains 96%-101% of full-prefill accuracy with only a 20% recomputation ratio, while achieving accuracy improvements of 8.8%-24.9% on RULER and 18.6%-50.9% on LongBench over the state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., CacheBlend, EPIC, and KVShare).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jihao Xin, Tian Lvu, David Keyes, Hatem Ltaief, Marco Canini</p>
<p>Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models is increasingly bottlenecked by the memory and compute cost of the KV-Cache. Low-rank factorization compresses KV projections by writing $W \approx A * B$, where A produces latent KV states and B can be absorbed into downstream weights. In modern RoPE-based LLMs, this absorption fails: RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing substantial memory and compute overhead. We propose RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP), which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure, restore B absorption, and eliminate reconstruction. Our evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows that RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30%, all at once, while maintaining strong accuracy. Notably, RAP reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02619">daVinci-Agency: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agency Data-Efficiently</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohan Jiang, Dayuan Fu, Junhao Shi, Ji Zeng, Weiye Si, Keyu Li, Xuefeng Li, Yang Xiao, Wenjie Li, Dequan Wang, Pengfei Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at short-term tasks, scaling them to long-horizon agentic workflows remains challenging. The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon. Beyond benchmark performance, our analysis confirms...</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/WaxalNLP under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonas Petersen, Camilla Mazzoleni, Riccardo Maggioni</p>
<p>Abstract: Transformers achieve remarkable performance across many domains, yet struggle with tasks requiring multi-hop relational reasoning over structured data. We analyze this limitation through circuit complexity: standard transformers are $\mathsf{TC}^0$-complete and cannot solve graph connectivity in constant depth, implying $\Omega(k)$ layers are necessary for $k$-hop reasoning regardless of model size or training data. We introduce RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention), a minimal architectural modification that provides structural inductive bias for relational reasoning. RASA adds: (1) sparse adjacency masking that restricts attention to graph-connected positions, reducing the attention pattern search space from $O(2^{n^2})$ to $O(2^m)$ for graphs with $m$ edges; and (2) learnable edge-type biases that encode relation-specific attention preferences. While RASA does not circumvent asymptotic depth requirements, the exponential reduction in attention pattern space provides stronger inductive bias for learning graph-structured functions. Empirically, on the MetaQA knowledge graph QA benchmark, RASA achieves 97.7% accuracy on 3-hop questions, outperforming EmbedKGQA (94.8%) by 2.9 percentage points. Notably, RASA's advantage grows with reasoning depth, validating that structural inductive bias is most beneficial for complex multi-hop queries. Our results demonstrate that minimal architectural modifications, grounded in complexity-theoretic analysis, can substantially improve multi-hop reasoning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Yao, Yi-Kai Zhang, Yuxin Chen, Yueqing Sun, Zishan Xu, Yu Yang, Tianhao Hu, Qi Gu, Hui Su, Xunliang Cai</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key approach for enhancing LLM reasoning. However, standard frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) typically employ a uniform rollout budget, leading to resource inefficiency. Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly integrated into photo applications on personal devices, making editing photographs easier than ever while potentially influencing the memories they represent. This study explores how and why people use GenAI to edit personal photos and how this shapes their remembering experience. We conducted a two-phase qualitative study with 12 participants: a photo editing session using a GenAI tool guided by the Remembering Experience (RX) dimensions, followed by semi-structured interviews where participants reflected on the editing process and results. Findings show that participants prioritised felt memory over factual accuracy. For different photo elements, environments were modified easily, however, editing was deemed unacceptable if it touched upon a person's identity. Editing processes brought positive and negative impacts, and itself also became a remembering experience. We further discuss potential benefits and risks of GenAI editing for remembering purposes and propose design implications for responsible GenAI.</p>

<p>Abstract: Learning from negative samples holds great promise for improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capability, yet existing methods treat all incorrect responses as equally informative, overlooking the crucial role of sample quality. To address this, we propose Plausible Negative Samples (PNS), a method that synthesizes high-quality negative samples exhibiting expected format and structural coherence while ultimately yielding incorrect answers. PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models.</p>
