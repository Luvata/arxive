<p><b>Authors:</b> Silvia Rondini, Claudia Alvarez-Martin, Paula Angermair-Barkai, Olivier Penacchio, M. Paz, Matthew Pelowski, Dan Dediu, Antoni Rodriguez-Fornells, Xim Cerda-Company</p>
<p>Abstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Oliver Kramer</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sang Truong, Yuheng Tu, Michael Hardy, Anka Reuel, Zeyu Tang, Jirayu Burapacheep, Jonathan Perera, Chibuike Uwakwe, Ben Domingue, Nick Haber, Sanmi Koyejo</p>
<p>Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Han, Lijun Zhang, Dejian Meng, Zhuang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erik P. Nyberg, Steven Mascaro, Ingrid Zukerman, Michael Wybrow, Duc-Minh Vo, Ann Nicholson</p>
<p>Abstract: Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.
  We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16997">MirrorMind: Empowering OmniScientist with the Expert Perspectives and Collective Knowledge of Human Scientists</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Qingbin Zeng, Bingbing Fan, Zhiyu Chen, Sijian Ren, Zhilun Zhou, Xuhua Zhang, Yuanyi Zhen, Fengli Xu, Yong Li, Tie-Yan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hao Chen, Renzheng Zhang, Scott S. Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Paloma Rabaey, Adrick Tench, Stefan Heytens, Thomas Demeester</p>
<p>Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sara Zuppiroli, Carmelo Fabio Longo, Anna Sofia Lippolis, Rocco Paolillo, Lorenzo Giammei, Miguel Ceriani, Francesco Poggi, Antonio Zinilli, Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese</p>
<p>Abstract: The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kesheng Chen, Wenjian Luo, Bang Zhang, Zeping Yin, Zipeng Ye</p>
<p>Abstract: Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17198">Designing Domain-Specific Agents via Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaiyu Li, Jiayu Wang, Zhi Wang, Hui Qiao, Weizhan Zhang, Deyu Meng, Xiangyong Cao</p>
<p>Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Virginia Dignum, Frank Dignum</p>
<p>Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathalie Kirch, Samuel Dower, Adrians Skapars, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Dmitrii Krasheninnikov</p>
<p>Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaxi Liu, Chengyuan Ma, Hang Zhou, Weizhe Tang, Shixiao Liang, Haoyang Ding, Xiaopeng Li, Bin Ran</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christian Perez, Carlos March, Miguel A. Salido</p>
<p>Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a pivotal challenge in operations research and is essential for evaluating the effectiveness and performance of scheduling algorithms. Scheduling problems are a crucial domain in combinatorial optimization, where resources (machines) are allocated to job tasks to minimize the completion time (makespan) alongside other objectives like energy consumption. This research delves into the intricacies of JSP, focusing on optimizing performance metrics and minimizing energy consumption while considering various constraints such as deadlines and release dates. Recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of benchmarking in JSP, this study underscores the significance of reference libraries and datasets like JSPLIB in enriching algorithm evaluation. The research highlights the importance of problem instance characteristics, including job and machine numbers, processing times, and machine availability, emphasizing the complexities introduced by energy consumption considerations.
  An innovative instance configurator is proposed, equipped with parameters such as the number of jobs, machines, tasks, and speeds, alongside distributions for processing times and energy consumption. The generated instances encompass various configurations, reflecting real-world scenarios and operational constraints. These instances facilitate comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation of scheduling algorithms, particularly in contexts of energy efficiency. A comprehensive set of 500 test instances has been generated and made publicly available, promoting further research and benchmarking in JSP. These instances enable robust analyses and foster collaboration in developing advanced, energy-efficient scheduling solutions by providing diverse scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guanlue Li, Xufeng Zhao, Fang Wu, S\"oren Laue</p>
<p>Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are governed by surface complementarity and hydrophobic interactions at protein interfaces. However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces. Next, a multi-model diffusion model predicts the corresponding structure, while Shape-Frame Matching Networks ensure alignment between surface geometry and backbone architecture. This integrated approach facilitates surface complementarity, conformational stability, and chemical feasibility. Extensive validation across diverse protein design scenarios demonstrates PepBridge's efficacy in generating structurally viable proteins, representing a significant advancement in the joint design of top-down protein structure.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Happymore Masoka</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multilingual natural language processing (NLP), the Bantu language Shona remains under-served in terms of morphological analysis and language-aware tools. This paper presents Shona spaCy, an open-source, rule-based morphological pipeline for Shona built on the spaCy framework. The system combines a curated JSON lexicon with linguistically grounded rules to model noun-class prefixes (Mupanda 1-18), verbal subject concords, tense-aspect markers, ideophones, and clitics, integrating these into token-level annotations for lemma, part-of-speech, and morphological features. The toolkit is available via pip install shona-spacy, with source code at https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/shona-spacy and a PyPI release at https://pypi.org/project/shona-spacy/0.1.4/. Evaluation on formal and informal Shona corpora yields 90% POS-tagging accuracy and 88% morphological-feature accuracy, while maintaining transparency in its linguistic decisions. By bridging descriptive grammar and computational implementation, Shona spaCy advances NLP accessibility and digital inclusion for Shona speakers and provides a template for morphological analysis tools for other under-resourced Bantu languages.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.
  To address this, we propose \textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.
  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \textbf{5.7$\times$} retrieval speedup and \textbf{1.8$\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linus Stuhlmann, Mauricio Fadel Argerich, Jonathan F\"urst</p>
<p>Abstract: Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360{\deg}. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Mahdi</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuetian Zou, Hanlei Zhang, Hua Xu, Songze Li, Long Xiao</p>
<p>Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Giulio Antonio Abbo, Tony Belpaeme</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samarth Garg, Deeksha Varshney, Divya Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saleh Almohaimeed, Saad Almohaimeed, Mousa Jari, Khaled A. Alobaid, Fahad Alotaibi</p>
<p>Abstract: Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jonathon Dilworth, Hui Yang, Jiaoyan Chen, Yongsheng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Juan P. Cadile</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).
  Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.
  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).
  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.</p>

<p>Abstract: Enterprise ERP systems managing hundreds of thousands of employee records face critical data quality challenges when human resources departments perform decentralized manual entry across multiple languages. We present an end-to-end pipeline combining automated data cleaning with LLM-driven SQL query generation, deployed on a production system managing 240,000 employee records over six months.
  The system operates in two integrated stages: a multi-stage cleaning pipeline that performs translation normalization, spelling correction, and entity deduplication during periodic synchronization from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL; and a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by GPT-4o that translates natural-language questions in Turkish, Russian, and English into validated SQL queries. The query engine employs LangChain orchestration, FAISS vector similarity search, and few-shot learning with 500+ validated examples.
  Our evaluation demonstrates 92.5% query validity, 95.1% schema compliance, and 90.7\% semantic accuracy on 2,847 production queries. The system reduces query turnaround time from 2.3 days to under 5 seconds while maintaining 99.2% uptime, with GPT-4o achieving 46% lower latency and 68% cost reduction versus GPT-3.5. This modular architecture provides a reproducible framework for AI-native enterprise data governance, demonstrating real-world viability at enterprise scale with 4.3/5.0 user satisfaction.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating adherence to PRISMA 2020 guideline remains a burden in the peer review process. To address the lack of shareable benchmarks, we constructed a copyright-aware benchmark of 108 Creative Commons-licensed systematic reviews and evaluated ten large language models (LLMs) across five input formats. In a development cohort, supplying structured PRISMA 2020 checklists (Markdown, JSON, XML, or plain text) yielded 78.7-79.7% accuracy versus 45.21% for manuscript-only input (p less than 0.0001), with no differences between structured formats (p>0.9). Across models, accuracy ranged from 70.6-82.8% with distinct sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, replicated in an independent validation cohort. We then selected Qwen3-Max (a high-sensitivity open-weight model) and extended evaluation to the full dataset (n=120), achieving 95.1% sensitivity and 49.3% specificity. Structured checklist provision substantially improves LLM-based PRISMA assessment, though human expert verification remains essential before editorial decisions.</p>

<p>Abstract: LLMs generate buggy code: 29.6% of SWE-bench "solved" patches fail, 62% of BaxBench solutions have vulnerabilities, and existing tools only catch 65% of bugs with 35% false positives. We built CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system that uses four specialized agents to detect different types of bugs. We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, confirmed by measuring agent correlation of p = 0.05--0.25. We also show that multiple vulnerabilities in the same code create exponentially more risk than previously thought--SQL injection plus exposed credentials creates 15x more danger (risk 300 vs. 20) than traditional models predict. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method while running faster and without test execution. We tested 15 different agent combinations and found that using multiple agents improves accuracy by 39.7 percentage points (from 32.8% to 72.4%) compared to single agents, with gains of +14.9pp, +13.5pp, and +11.2pp for agents 2, 3, and 4. The best two-agent combination reaches 79.3% accuracy. Testing on 300 real patches from Claude Sonnet 4.5 runs in under 200ms per sample, making this practical for production use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yige Li, Zhe Li, Wei Zhao, Nay Myat Min, Hanxun Huang, Xingjun Ma, Jun Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the secure deployment of large language models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to implant hidden behaviors triggered by specific inputs. However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \textit{Bias Recommendation}, \textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

<p>Abstract: Personalized dual-person portrait customization has considerable potential applications, such as preserving emotional memories and facilitating wedding photography planning. However, the absence of a benchmark dataset hinders the pursuit of high-quality customization in dual-person portrait generation. In this paper, we propose the PairHuman dataset, which is the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for generating dual-person portraits that meet high photographic standards. The PairHuman dataset contains more than 100K images that capture a variety of scenes, attire, and dual-person interactions, along with rich metadata, including detailed image descriptions, person localization, human keypoints, and attribute tags. We also introduce DHumanDiff, which is a baseline specifically crafted for dual-person portrait generation that features enhanced facial consistency and simultaneously balances in personalized person generation and semantic-driven scene creation. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our dataset and method produce highly customized portraits with superior visual quality that are tailored to human preferences.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Li, Kuiye Ding, Chuanguang Yang, Hao Wang, Haoxuan Wang, Huiran Duan, Junming Liu, Yingli Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental across many domains, yet training accurate models often requires large-scale datasets and substantial computational resources. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.
  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead. All code and distilled datasets will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: Although passwords remain the primary defense against unauthorized access, users often tend to use passwords that are easy to remember. This behavior significantly increases security risks, also due to the fact that traditional password strength evaluation methods are often inadequate. In this discussion paper, we present SODA ADVANCE, a data reconstruction tool also designed to enhance evaluation processes related to the password strength. In particular, SODA ADVANCE integrates a specialized module aimed at evaluating password strength by leveraging publicly available data from multiple sources, including social media platforms. Moreover, we investigate the capabilities and risks associated with emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) in evaluating and generating passwords, respectively. Experimental assessments conducted with 100 real users demonstrate that LLMs can generate strong and personalized passwords possibly defined according to user profiles. Additionally, LLMs were shown to be effective in evaluating passwords, especially when they can take into account user profile data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Asya Y. Akkus, Bradley T. Wolfe, Pinghan Chu, Chengkun Huang, Chris S. Campbell, Mariana Alvarado Alvarez, Petr Volegov, David Fittinghoff, Robert Reinovsky, Zhehui Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Adeel Yousaf, Joseph Fioresi, James Beetham, Amrit Singh Bedi, Mubarak Shah</p>
<p>Abstract: Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wei-Cheng Tseng, Xuanru Zhou, Mingyue Huo, Yiwen Shao, Hao Zhang, Dong Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Audio-language pretraining holds promise for general-purpose audio understanding, yet remains underexplored compared to its vision counterpart. While vision-language models like CLIP serve as widely adopted foundations, existing audio-language models primarily excel at retrieval tasks with limited adoption as general-purpose encoders. We identify three key barriers: limited large-scale audio-text corpora, insufficient caption diversity, and lack of systematic exploration and evaluation. To this end, we introduce CaptionStew, a 10.7M caption dataset aggregating diverse open-source audio-text corpora across multiple domains and captioning styles. Using this resource, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing contrastive and captioning objectives for audio representation learning across speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Our results demonstrate that audio-language pretraining yields competitive, transferable representations. Through systematic data-scaling experiments, we reveal complementary objective strengths: contrastive learning achieves superior data efficiency at smaller scales, while captioning demonstrates better scalability on language-involved audio understanding tasks. We also find that common supervised initialization practices provide diminishing returns at scale, challenging current approaches. These findings establish audio-language pretraining as a viable pathway toward general-purpose audio representations, guiding future research. To accelerate progress, we release data preparation recipes, training protocols, and pretrained models, paving the way toward universal audio understanding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chen Liang, Jiawen Zheng, Yufeng Zeng, Yi Tan, Hengye Lyu, Yuhui Zheng, Zisu Li, Yueting Weng, Jiaxin Shi, Hanwang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Generative Augmented Reality (GAR) as a next-generation paradigm that reframes augmentation as a process of world re-synthesis rather than world composition by a conventional AR engine. GAR replaces the conventional AR engine's multi-stage modules with a unified generative backbone, where environmental sensing, virtual content, and interaction signals are jointly encoded as conditioning inputs for continuous video generation. We formalize the computational correspondence between AR and GAR, survey the technical foundations that make real-time generative augmentation feasible, and outline prospective applications that leverage its unified inference model. We envision GAR as a future AR paradigm that delivers high-fidelity experiences in terms of realism, interactivity, and immersion, while eliciting new research challenges on technologies, content ecosystems, and the ethical and societal implications.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yaoxin Yang, Peng Ye, Xudong Tan, Chongjun Tu, Maosen Zhao, Jia Hao, Tao Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiatao Sun, Chen Liang, Qian Wang, Daniel Rakita</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Eyad Gad, Zubair Md Fadlullah, Mostafa M. Fouda</p>
<p>Abstract: In the context of the growing proliferation of user devices and the concurrent surge in data volumes, the complexities arising from the substantial increase in data have posed formidable challenges to conventional machine learning model training. Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.</p>

<p>Abstract: Evaluating and measuring AI Safety Level (ASL) threats are crucial for guiding stakeholders to implement safeguards that keep risks within acceptable limits. ASL-3+ models present a unique risk in their ability to uplift novice non-state actors, especially in the realm of biosecurity. Existing evaluation metrics, such as LAB-Bench, BioLP-bench, and WMDP, can reliably assess model uplift and domain knowledge. However, metrics that better contextualize "real-world risks" are needed to inform the safety case for LLMs, along with scalable, open-ended metrics to keep pace with their rapid advancements. To address both gaps, we introduce MOCET, an interpretable and doubly-scalable metric (automatable and open-ended) that can quantify real-world risks.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce WorldGen, a system that enables the automatic creation of large-scale, interactive 3D worlds directly from text prompts. Our approach transforms natural language descriptions into traversable, fully textured environments that can be immediately explored or edited within standard game engines. By combining LLM-driven scene layout reasoning, procedural generation, diffusion-based 3D generation, and object-aware scene decomposition, WorldGen bridges the gap between creative intent and functional virtual spaces, allowing creators to design coherent, navigable worlds without manual modeling or specialized 3D expertise. The system is fully modular and supports fine-grained control over layout, scale, and style, producing worlds that are geometrically consistent, visually rich, and efficient to render in real time. This work represents a step towards accessible, generative world-building at scale, advancing the frontier of 3D generative AI for applications in gaming, simulation, and immersive social environments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Fu, Lifang He, Qingyu Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Existing EEG foundation models mainly treat neural signals as generic time series in Euclidean space, ignoring the intrinsic geometric structure of neural dynamics that constrains brain activity to low-dimensional manifolds. This fundamental mismatch between model assumptions and neural geometry limits representation quality and cross-subject generalization. ManifoldFormer addresses this limitation through a novel geometric deep learning framework that explicitly learns neural manifold representations. The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization. The geometric approach reveals meaningful neural patterns consistent with neurophysiological principles, establishing geometric constraints as essential for effective EEG foundation models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Transformers have defined the state-of-the-art for clinical prediction tasks involving electronic health records (EHRs). The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data. This paper presents a first ablation study with systematic design choices for input tokenization, model configuration and temporal data preprocessing. Future model development in clinical prediction tasks using EHRs could build upon this study's recommendation as a starting point.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Monitoring aquatic species, especially elusive ones like lobsters, presents challenges. This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).
  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.
  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds. This research offers a promising non-invasive PAM approach for lobster conservation, detection, and management in aquaculture and fisheries, enabling real-world edge computing applications for underwater species.</p>

<p>Abstract: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address.

<p>Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that, in addition to directly impairing functional mobility, is frequently associated with vocal impairments such as hypophonia and dysarthria, which typically manifest in the early stages. The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\%$ and $92.11\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies. Overall, this study confirms the efficiency of DNNs and emphasizes their potential to provide greater accuracy and reliability for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using voice-based biomarkers.</p>

<p>Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trieu Nguyen, Hao-Wei Pang, Shasha Feng</p>
<p>Abstract: Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging modality that combines biologics-like affinity with small-molecule-like developability, but their vast combinatorial space and multi-parameter objectives make lead optimization slow and challenging. Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints. Overall, PepEVOLVE offers a practical, reproducible path to peptide lead optimization when optimal edit sites are unknown, enabling more efficient exploration and improving design quality across multiple objectives.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Gao, Jingyu Wu, Xiangkai Xu, Kangni Xie, Yunchen Zhang, Bin Zhong, Xurui Gao, Min-Ling Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianyu Zhan, Kairui Fu, Zheqi Lv, Shengyu Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kirill Nagaitsev, Luka Grbcic, Samuel Williams, Costin Iancu</p>
<p>Abstract: Maximizing performance on available GPU hardware is an ongoing challenge for modern AI inference systems. Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunyun Wang, Zheng Duan, Xinyue Liao, Ke-Jia Chen, Songcan Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model. Our framework discovers identity-editing directions through optimization guided by novel reagent losses, which supervise for attribute preservation and identity suppression. We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junjie Hao, Chun Wang, Ying Qiao, Qiuyue Zuo, Qiya Song, Hua Ma, Xieping Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lingyan Ruan, Bin Chen, Taehyun Rhee</p>
<p>Abstract: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangrui Xiong, Yichuan Lu, Zifei Pan, Chang Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chest radiography remains one of the most widely used imaging modalities for thoracic diagnosis, yet increasing imaging volumes and radiologist workload continue to challenge timely interpretation. In this work, we investigate the use of MedImageInsight, a medical imaging foundational model, for automated binary classification of chest X-rays into Normal and Abnormal categories. Two approaches were evaluated: (1) fine-tuning MedImageInsight for end-to-end classification, and (2) employing the model as a feature extractor for a transfer learning pipeline using traditional machine learning classifiers. Experiments were conducted using a combination of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and real-world clinical data sourced from partner hospitals. The fine-tuned classifier achieved the highest performance, with an ROC-AUC of 0.888 and superior calibration compared to the transfer learning models, demonstrating performance comparable to established architectures such as CheXNet. These results highlight the effectiveness of foundational medical imaging models in reducing task-specific training requirements while maintaining diagnostic reliability. The system is designed for integration into web-based and hospital PACS workflows to support triage and reduce radiologist burden. Future work will extend the model to multi-label pathology classification to provide preliminary diagnostic interpretation in clinical environments.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Teng Fu, Mengyang Zhao, Ke Niu, Kaixin Peng, Bin Li</p>
<p>Abstract: LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.</p>

<p>Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kushal Agrawal, Frank Xiao, Guido Bergman, Asa Cooper Stickland</p>
<p>Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool-using agents causes their alignment training to manifest in new ways. Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Duo Zhou, Yuji Zhang, Tianxin Wei, Ruizhong Qiu, Ke Yang, Xiao Lin, Cheng Qian, Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong, Heng Ji, Huan Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients ("retain-invariant"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgios Anyfantis, Pere Barlet-Ros</p>
<p>Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential tools for detecting network attacks and intrusions. While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.</p>

<p>Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeqin Zhang, Yizheng Zhao, Chen Hu, Binxing Jiao, Daxin Jiang, Ruihang Miao, Cam-Tu Nguyen</p>
<p>Abstract: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Horia Cristescu, Charles Park, Trong Canh Nguyen, Sergiu Talmacel, Alexandru-Gabriel Ilie, Stefan Adam</p>
<p>Abstract: While current Computer Use Agent (CUA) benchmarks measure task completion effectively, they provide limited assessment of enterprise deployment readiness, emphasizing functional correctness over the operational reliability required for production systems. We present UI-CUBE (UiPath Computer Use BEnchmark), a systematic benchmark comprising 226 tasks across two difficulty tiers designed to expose fundamental architectural limitations in current CUAs. Our evaluation covers simple UI interactions (136 tasks) and complex workflows including copy-paste tasks (50 tasks) and enterprise application scenarios (40 tasks), with systematic interface variation coverage, multi-resolution testing and automated validation of task success through the application state. Evaluation of five state-of-the-art models reveals a sharp capability cliff rather than gradual performance degradation. Simple UI interactions achieve 67-85% success rates (compared to 97.9% human performance), but complex workflows drop precipitously to 9-19%. Human evaluators with no prior application experience achieve only 61.2% on complex tasks despite near-perfect performance on simple tasks, establishing realistic performance ceilings. This discontinuous performance pattern -- where agents achieve 68-87% of human performance on simple tasks but only 15-32% on complex workflows -- indicates fundamental architectural limitations in memory management, hierarchical planning, and state coordination rather than incremental capability gaps addressable through better training or prompting. UI-CUBE functions as an enterprise-readiness diagnostic, revealing that while current CUAs can manipulate individual interface elements, they cannot yet function as reliable workflow automation tools. These findings provide architectural insights essential for developing production-ready CUAs capable of managing complex, multi-step enterprise processes.</p>

<p>Abstract: Device-guided music transfer adapts playback across unseen devices for users who lack them. Existing methods mainly focus on modifying the timbre, rhythm, harmony, or instrumentation to mimic genres or artists, overlooking the diverse hardware properties of the playback device (i.e., speaker). Therefore, we propose DeMT, which processes a speaker's frequency response curve as a line graph using a vision-language model to extract device embeddings. These embeddings then condition a hybrid transformer via feature-wise linear modulation. Fine-tuned on a self-collected dataset, DeMT enables effective speaker-style transfer and robust few-shot adaptation for unseen devices, supporting applications like device-style augmentation and quality enhancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qianyi Wang, Guoqiang Ren</p>
<p>Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vy Nguyen, Ziqi Xu, Jeffrey Chan, Estrid He, Feng Xia, Xiuzhen Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammad Zare</p>
<p>Abstract: News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yusuf \c{C}elebi, Mahmoud El Hussieni, \"Ozay Ezerceli</p>
<p>Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanshan Li, Da Huang, Yu He, Yanwei Fu, Yu-Gang Jiang, Xiangyang Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: In daily life, people often move through spaces to find objects that meet their needs, posing a key challenge in embodied AI. Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Deep Model Predictive Control (Deep MPC) is an evolving field that integrates model predictive control and deep learning. This manuscript is focused on a particular approach, which employs deep neural network in the loop with MPC. This class of approaches distributes control authority between a neural network and an MPC controller, in such a way that the neural network learns the model uncertainties while the MPC handles constraints. The approach is appealing because training data collected while the system is in operation can be used to fine-tune the neural network, and MPC prevents unsafe behavior during those learning transients. This manuscript explains implementation challenges of Deep MPC, algorithmic way to distribute control authority and argues that a poor choice in distributing control authority may lead to poor performance. A reason of poor performance is explained through a numerical experiment on a four-wheeled skid-steer dynamics.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anshul Singh, Rohan Chaudhary, Gagneet Singh, Abhay Kumary</p>
<p>Abstract: The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiaye Qian, Ge Zheng, Yuchen Zhu, Sibei Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.</p>

<p>Abstract: Nowadays, we are witnessing an Artificial Intelligence revolution that dominates the technology landscape in various application domains, such as healthcare, robotics, automotive, security, and defense. Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology. Therefore, DISCA significantly improves the energy efficiency for matrix multiplication workloads by orders of magnitude if scaled and compared to its counterpart architectures.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suchetan G. Uppur, Hemant Kumar, Vaibhav Kumar</p>
<p>Abstract: Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Julien Merand, Boris Meden, Mathieu Grossard</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents an efficient approach for determining the joint configuration of a multifingered gripper solely from the point cloud data of its poly-articulated chain, as generated by visual sensors, simulations or even generative neural networks. Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning.</p>

<p>Abstract: Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Nordstr\"om, Johan Edstedt, Fredrik Kahl, Georg B\"okman</p>
<p>Abstract: Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Callie C. Liao, Duoduo Liao, Ellie L. Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have made music generation a prominent research focus. However, many neural-based models rely on large datasets, raising concerns about copyright infringement and high-performance costs. In contrast, we propose MusicAIR, an innovative multimodal AI music generation framework powered by a novel algorithm-driven symbolic music core, effectively mitigating copyright infringement risks. The music core algorithms connect critical lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features, creating a complete, coherent melodic score solely from the lyrics. The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions. As a co-pilot tool, GenAIM can serve as a reliable music composition assistant and a possible educational composition tutor while simultaneously lowering the entry barrier for all aspiring musicians, which is innovative and significantly contributes to AI for music generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sydney Reis</p>
<p>Abstract: According to the theory of International Political Economy (IPE), states are often incentivized to rely on rather than constrain powerful corporations. For this reason, IPE provides a useful lens to explain why efforts to govern Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the international and national levels have thus far been developed, applied, and enforced unevenly. Building on recent work that explores how AI companies engage in geopolitics, this position paper argues that some AI workers can be considered actors of geopolitics. It makes the timely case that governance alone cannot ensure responsible, ethical, or robust AI development and use, and greater attention should be paid to bottom-up interventions at the site of AI development. AI workers themselves should be situated as individual agents of change, especially when considering their potential to foster Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA). Drawing on methods of Participatory Design (PD), this paper proposes engaging AI workers as sources of knowledge, relative power, and intentionality to encourage more responsible and just AI development and create the conditions that can facilitate ACA.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marius Rodrigues (IDS, S2A), Louis Bahrman (IDS, S2A), Roland Badeau (IDS, S2A), Ga\"el Richard (S2A, IDS)</p>
<p>Abstract: In unsupervised or weakly-supervised approaches for speech dereverberation, the target clean (dry) signals are considered to be unknown during training. In that context, evaluating to what extent information can be retrieved from the sole knowledge of reverberant (wet) speech becomes critical. This work investigates the role of the reverberant (wet) phase in the time-frequency domain. Based on Statistical Wave Field Theory, we show that late reverberation perturbs phase components with white, uniformly distributed noise, except at low frequencies. Consequently, the wet phase carries limited useful information and is not essential for weakly supervised dereverberation. To validate this finding, we train dereverberation models under a recent weak supervision framework and demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by excluding the reverberant phase from the loss function.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Emma Andrews, Prabhat Mishra</p>
<p>Abstract: Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum computing and quantum autoencoders. In this paper, we propose quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) that can effectively learn missing features of a data sample within quantum states instead of classical embeddings. We showcase that our QMAE architecture can learn the masked features of an image and can reconstruct the masked input image with improved visual fidelity in MNIST images. Experimental evaluation highlights that QMAE can significantly outperform (12.86% on average) in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders in the presence of masks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Georgia Baltsou, Ioannis Sarridis, Christos Koutlis, Symeon Papadopoulos</p>
<p>Abstract: Face verification is a significant component of identity authentication in various applications including online banking and secure access to personal devices. The majority of the existing face image datasets often suffer from notable biases related to race, gender, and other demographic characteristics, limiting the effectiveness and fairness of face verification systems. In response to these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced generative models to create varied and diverse high-quality synthetic face images. This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance. By tackling the inherent inequities in existing datasets, this work not only enriches the discussion on diversity and ethics in artificial intelligence but also lays the foundation for developing more inclusive and reliable face verification technologies</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sukwon Yun, Heming Yao, Burkhard Hoeckendorf, David Richmond, Aviv Regev, Russell Littman</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: "Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yesheng Liu, Hao Li, Haiyu Xu, Baoqi Pei, Jiahao Wang, Mingxuan Zhao, Jingshu Zheng, Zheqi He, JG Yao, Bowen Qin, Xi Yang, Jiajun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yeamin Kaiser, Muhammed Tasnim Bin Anwar, Bholanath Das, Chowdhury Farhan Ahmed, Md. Tanvir Alam</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph representation learning seeks to transform complex, high-dimensional graph structures into compact vector spaces that preserve both topology and semantics. Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime. These results highlight the potential of unified, single-phase discriminative mining as a foundation for scalable and interpretable graph representation learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Christopher Boland, Sotirios Tsaftaris, Sonia Dahdouh</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shrikant Kendre, Austin Xu, Honglu Zhou, Michael Ryoo, Shafiq Joty, Juan Carlos Niebles</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional evaluation metrics for textual and visual question answering, like ROUGE, METEOR, and Exact Match (EM), focus heavily on n-gram based lexical similarity, often missing the deeper semantic understanding needed for accurate assessment. While measures like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage contextual embeddings to address this limitation, they lack flexibility in balancing sentence-level and keyword-level semantics and ignore lexical similarity, which remains important. Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patryk Krukowski, Jan Miksa, Piotr Helm, Jacek Tabor, Pawe{\l} Wawrzy\'nski, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

<p>Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied to creative domains, leading to the development of systems that collaborate with humans in design processes. In Graphic Design, integrating computational systems into co-creative workflows presents specific challenges, as it requires balancing scientific rigour with the subjective and visual nature of design practice. Following the PRISMA methodology, we identified 872 articles, resulting in a final corpus of 71 publications describing 68 unique systems. Based on this review, we introduce GRAPHIC (Guidelines for Reviewing Algorithmic Practices in Human-centred Design and Interaction for Creativity), a framework for analysing AI-based systems applied to Graphic Design. Its goal is to understand how current systems support human-AI collaboration in the Graphic Design discipline. The framework comprises main dimensions, which our analysis revealed to be essential across diverse system types: (1) Collaborative Panorama, (2) Processes and Modalities, and (3) Graphic Design Principles. Its application revealed research gaps, including the need to balance initiative and control between agents, improve communication through explainable interaction models, and promote systems that support transformational creativity grounded in core design principles.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yidong Huang, Zun Wang, Han Lin, Dong-Ki Kim, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Jaehong Yoon, Yue Zhang, Mohit Bansal</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.</p>

<p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for persona-based language model system, motivated by the need for personalized AI agents that adapt to individual user preferences. In our approach, the agent embodies the user's "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge. On the LaMP benchmark, our method improves news categorization F1 by 11.1%, movie tagging F1 by 56.1%, and reduces product rating MAE by 10.4% over prior methods.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhen Wang, Zhifeng Gao, Guolin Ke</p>
<p>Abstract: Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ayhan Kucukmanisa, Derya Gelmez, Sukru Selim Calik, Zeynep Hilal Kilimci</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal deep learning have greatly enhanced the capability of systems for speech analysis and pronunciation assessment. Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Quranic recitation, where subtle phonetic differences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings extracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, intermediate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29 Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a detailed comparison of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection. The study contributes to the development of intelligent, speaker-independent, and multimodal Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems, offering a practical step toward technology-supported Quranic pronunciation training and broader speech-based educational applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: In this article, we are interested in planning problems where the agent is aware of the presence of an observer, and where this observer is in a partial observability situation. The agent has to choose its strategy so as to optimize the information transmitted by observations. Building on observer-aware Markov decision processes (OAMDPs), we propose a framework to handle this type of problems and thus formalize properties such as legibility, explicability and predictability. This extension of OAMDPs to partial observability can not only handle more realistic problems, but also permits considering dynamic hidden variables of interest. These dynamic target variables allow, for instance, working with predictability, or with legibility problems where the goal might change during execution. We discuss theoretical properties of PO-OAMDPs and, experimenting with benchmark problems, we analyze HSVI's convergence behavior with dedicated initializations and study the resulting strategies.</p>

<p>Abstract: Research is a fundamental process driving the advancement of human civilization, yet it demands substantial time and effort from researchers. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has inspired researchers to explore how AI can accelerate and enhance research. To monitor relevant advancements, this paper presents a systematic review of the progress in this domain. Specifically, we organize the relevant studies into three main categories: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Diana Febrita</p>
<p>Abstract: Map digitization is an important process that converts maps into digital formats that can be used for further analysis. This process typically requires a deep human involvement because of the need for interpretation and decision-making when translating complex features. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an alternative to conducting map digitization with the help of machine learning techniques. Deepness, or Deep Neural Remote Sensing, is an advanced AI-driven tool designed and integrated as a plugin in QGIS application. This research focuses on assessing the effectiveness of Deepness in automated digitization. This study analyses AI-generated digitization results from Google Earth imagery and compares them with digitized outputs from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to evaluate performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sutapa Dey Tithi, Arun Kumar Ramesh, Clara DiMarco, Xiaoyi Tian, Nazia Alam, Kimia Fazeli, Tiffany Barnes</p>
<p>Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated effectiveness in teaching formal propositional logic proofs, but their reliance on template-based explanations limits their ability to provide personalized student feedback. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance up to 86.7% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with logic tutoring hints, but require additional modifications to ensure accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.</p>

<p>Abstract: Meta-World is widely used for evaluating multi-task and meta-reinforcement learning agents, which are challenged to master diverse skills simultaneously. Since its introduction however, there have been numerous undocumented changes which inhibit a fair comparison of algorithms. This work strives to disambiguate these results from the literature, while also leveraging the past versions of Meta-World to provide insights into multi-task and meta-reinforcement learning benchmark design. Through this process we release a new open-source version of Meta-World (https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Metaworld/) that has full reproducibility of past results, is more technically ergonomic, and gives users more control over the tasks that are included in a task set.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Satiyabooshan Murugaboopathy, Connor T. Jerzak, Adel Daoud</p>
<p>Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuo Liu, Tianle Chen, Zeyu Liang, Xueguang Lyu, Christopher Amato</p>
<p>Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinyan Jiang, Lin Zhang, Jiayi Zhang, Qingsong Yang, Guimin Hu, Di Wang, Lijie Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations. However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes, often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Daniel Daza, Alberto Bernardi, Luca Costabello, Christophe Gueret, Masoud Mansoury, Michael Cochez, Martijn Schut</p>
<p>Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve entities that are \emph{likely} to be answers, which is particularly useful when such answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges. However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem of query answering with soft constraints. We formalize the problem and introduce two efficient methods designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting the original answers to a query. These methods are lightweight, requiring tuning only two parameters or a small neural network trained to capture soft constraints while maintaining the original ranking structure. To evaluate the task, we extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance and adding very little overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Abhishek Jindal, Dmitry Kalashnikov, R. Alex Hofer, Oscar Chang, Divya Garikapati, Anirudha Majumdar, Pierre Sermanet, Vikas Sindhwani</p>
<p>Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sihan Hu, Xiansheng Cai, Yuan Huang, Zhiyuan Yao, Linfeng Zhang, Pan Zhang, Youjin Deng, Kun Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p>

<p>Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters, enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and animation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Linyi Yang, Yixuan Weng</p>
<p>Abstract: Current deep-research agents run in a ''fire-and-forget'' mode: once started, they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution. We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design. A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live ''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/ResearAI/ResearStudio. We will continue to update the repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents. Our live demo is publicly accessible at http://ai-researcher.net:3000/.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yoonjin Lee, Munhee Kim, Hanbi Choi, Juhyeon Park, Seungho Lyoo, Woojin Park</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains (NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs. 3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit assessment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Letian Chen, Runhan Shi, Gufeng Yu, Yang Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Aligning molecular sequence representations (e.g., SMILES notations) with textual descriptions is critical for applications spanning drug discovery, materials design, and automated chemical literature analysis. Existing methodologies typically treat molecular captioning (molecule-to-text) and text-based molecular design (text-to-molecule) as separate tasks, relying on supervised fine-tuning or contrastive learning pipelines. These approaches face three key limitations: (i) conventional metrics like BLEU prioritize linguistic fluency over chemical accuracy, (ii) training datasets frequently contain chemically ambiguous narratives with incomplete specifications, and (iii) independent optimization of generation directions leads to bidirectional inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose RTMol, a bidirectional alignment framework that unifies molecular captioning and text-to-SMILES generation through self-supervised round-trip learning. The framework introduces novel round-trip evaluation metrics and enables unsupervised training for molecular captioning without requiring paired molecule-text corpora. Experiments demonstrate that RTMol enhances bidirectional alignment performance by up to 47% across various LLMs, establishing an effective paradigm for joint molecule-text understanding and generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhe Li, Yehan Qiu, Yujie Chen, Xiang Zhou</p>
<p>Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles,host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials,and the severity of infection. This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at about 20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pei Yang, Ke Zhang, Ji Wang, Xiao Chen, Yuxin Tang, Eric Yang, Lynn Ai, Bill Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tianlong Zhang, Hongwei Xue, Shilin Yan, Di Wu, Chen Xu, Yunyun Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis -- where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones -- and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.</p>

A bidirectional LSTM is trained for attribute prediction; a minimal architectural change, removing the global average over the sequence and applying a Dense layer at each point, yields per point attribute scores. Aggregating points whose score exceeds an attribute specific threshold across many portraits produces new drawings we call FaCells: statistical abstractions of attributes such as Eyeglasses, Wavy Hair, or Bangs. Across ablations, absolute coordinates with travel-minimizing order and a global average readout perform best; this configuration is then adapted to produce per-point scores. Multilabel training over 40 attributes is stable, and attributes reaching at least 50% balanced accuracy are visualized as FaCells. Complementary notions (e.g., No_Beard) are constructed by selecting points below a negative threshold. FaCells foregrounds interpretability as a creative tool: the resulting works are plotter ready, reproducible, and inexpensive to realize, yet materially present. Presented at Spectrum Miami 2025, the project bridges data, model, and paper while acknowledging the limits of the labels and the biases of the dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Han Zheng, Zimu Li, Sergii Strelchuk, Risi Kondor, Junyu Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU$(d)$ symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxian Gu, Li Dong, Furu Wei, Minlie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising technique for reducing the high computational demand of large language models (LLMs). However, previous KD methods are primarily applied to white-box classification models or training small models to imitate black-box model APIs like ChatGPT. How to effectively distill the knowledge of white-box LLMs into small models is still under-explored, which becomes more important with the prosperity of open-source LLMs. In this work, we propose a KD approach that distills LLMs into smaller language models. We first replace the forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) objective in the standard KD approaches with reverse KLD, which is more suitable for KD on generative language models, to prevent the student model from overestimating the low-probability regions of the teacher distribution. Then, we derive an effective on-policy optimization approach to learn this objective. The student models are named MiniLLM. Extensive experiments in the instruction-following setting show that MiniLLM generates more precise responses with higher overall quality, lower exposure bias, better calibration, and higher long-text generation performance than the baselines. Our method is scalable for different model families with 120M to 13B parameters. Our code, data, and model checkpoints can be found in https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sahibzada Adil Shahzad, Ammarah Hashmi, Yan-Tsung Peng, Yu Tsao, Hsin-Min Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal manipulations (also known as audio-visual deepfakes) make it difficult for unimodal deepfake detectors to detect forgeries in multimedia content. To avoid the spread of false propaganda and fake news, timely detection is crucial. The damage to either modality (i.e., visual or audio) can only be discovered through multimodal models that can exploit both pieces of information simultaneously. However, previous methods mainly adopt unimodal video forensics and use supervised pre-training for forgery detection. This study proposes a new method based on a multimodal self-supervised-learning (SSL) feature extractor to exploit inconsistency between audio and visual modalities for multimodal video forgery detection. We use the transformer-based SSL pre-trained Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT) model as a visual and acoustic feature extractor and a multi-scale temporal convolutional neural network to capture the temporal correlation between the audio and visual modalities. Since AV-HuBERT only extracts visual features from the lip region, we also adopt another transformer-based video model to exploit facial features and capture spatial and temporal artifacts caused during the deepfake generation process. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all existing models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the FakeAVCeleb and DeepfakeTIMIT datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Keith Burghardt, Daniel M. T. Fessler, Chyna Tang, Anne Pisor, Kristina Lerman</p>
<p>Abstract: Socio-linguistic indicators of affectively-relevant phenomena, such as emotion or sentiment, are often extracted from text to better understand features of human-computer interactions, including on social media. However, an indicator that is often overlooked is the presence or absence of information concerning harms or hazards. Here, we develop a new model to detect information concerning hazards, trained on a new collection of annotated X posts. We show that not only does this model perform well (outperforming, e.g., dictionary approaches), but that the hazard information it extracts is not strongly correlated with common indicators. To demonstrate the utility of our tool, we apply it to two datasets of X posts that discuss important geopolitical events, namely the Israel-Hamas war and the 2022 French national election. In both cases, we find that hazard information, especially information concerning conflict, is common. We extract accounts associated with information campaigns from each data set to explore how information about hazards could be used to attempt to influence geopolitical events. We find that inorganic accounts representing the viewpoints of weaker sides in a conflict often discuss hazards to civilians, potentially as a way to elicit aid for the weaker side. Moreover, the rate at which these hazards are mentioned differs markedly from organic accounts, likely reflecting information operators' efforts to frame the given geopolitical event for strategic purposes. These results are first steps towards exploring hazards within an information warfare environment. The model is shared as a Python package to help researchers and journalists analyze hazard content. The model, along with data and annotations, is available in the following repository: https://github.com/KeithBurghardt/DetectHazards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Lorenzo Chicchi, Lorenzo Buffoni, Diego Febbe, Lorenzo Giambagli, Raffaele Marino, Duccio Fanelli</p>
<p>Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features. Isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. Moreover, by leveraging on the regularization of the eigenvalues, it is possible to enforce solutions making use of a minimum subset of the input components, increasing the explainability of the model and providing sparse input representations. The technique is compared to the most common methods in the literature and is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthew Nyaaba, Alyson Wright, Gyu Lim Choi</p>
<p>Abstract: This study examines how Generative Artificial Intelligence reproduces global power hierarchies in education and proposes a framework to address resulting inequities. Using a critical qualitative design, the study conducted zero-shot prompt testing with two leading systems, ChatGPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5, and collected real-time outputs from Global North and South contexts. A critical interpretive analysis traced textual, visual, and structural patterns that revealed forms of digital neocolonialism and their implications for educational equity.
  Findings show six ways in which GenAI can reinforce Western dominance. Western curriculum assumptions appeared when Gemini listed the same four seasons for the United States and Ghana, reflecting Western climatology and overlooking regional knowledge systems. Other patterns included cultural stereotyping in imagery, Western-centered examples in instructional outputs, limited support for Indigenous and local languages, underrepresentation of non-Western identities in visuals, and access barriers linked to subscription-based models. These patterns demonstrate how GenAI can reproduce inequities even as it introduces new educational opportunities.
  In response, the study proposes a dual-pathway mitigation model. The Inclusive AI Design pathway includes three components: liberatory design methods that center non-Western epistemologies, anticipatory approaches to reduce representational harm, and decentralized GenAI hubs that support local participation and data sovereignty. The pedagogical pathway, human-centric prompt engineering, equips educators to contextualize prompts and critically engage with outputs. Together, these pathways position GenAI as a tool that can support more equitable and culturally responsive education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhiyuan Pan, Xing Hu, Xin Xia, Xiaohu Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, repository-level code generation presents unique challenges, particularly due to the need to utilize information spread across multiple files within a repository. Specifically, successful generation depends on a solid grasp of both general, context-agnostic knowledge and specific, context-dependent knowledge. While LLMs are widely used for the context-agnostic aspect, existing retrieval-based approaches sometimes fall short as they are limited in obtaining a broader and deeper repository context. In this paper, we present CatCoder, a novel code generation framework designed for statically typed programming languages. CatCoder enhances repository-level code generation by integrating relevant code and type context. Specifically, it leverages static analyzers to extract type dependencies and merges this information with retrieved code to create comprehensive prompts for LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of CatCoder, we adapt and construct benchmarks that include 199 Java tasks and 90 Rust tasks. The results show that CatCoder outperforms the RepoCoder baseline by up to 14.44% and 17.35%, in terms of compile@k and pass@k scores. In addition, the generalizability of CatCoder is assessed using various LLMs, including both code-specialized models and general-purpose models. Our findings indicate consistent performance improvements across all models, which underlines the practicality of CatCoder. Furthermore, we evaluate the time consumption of CatCoder in a large open source repository, and the results demonstrate the scalability of CatCoder.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pascal J. Sager, Jan M. Deriu, Benjamin F. Grewe, Thilo Stadelmann, Christoph von der Malsburg</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce the Cooperative Network Architecture (CNA), a model that represents sensory signals using structured, recurrently connected networks of neurons, termed "nets." Nets are dynamically assembled from overlapping net fragments, which are learned based on statistical regularities in sensory input. This architecture offers robustness to noise, deformation, and generalization to out-of-distribution data, addressing challenges in current vision systems from a novel perspective. We demonstrate that net fragments can be learned without supervision and flexibly recombined to encode novel patterns, enabling figure completion and resilience to noise. Our findings establish CNA as a promising paradigm for developing neural representations that integrate local feature processing with global structure formation, providing a foundation for future research on invariant object recognition.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fanglong Yao, Yuanchang Yue, Youzhi Liu, Xian Sun, Kun Fu</p>
<p>Abstract: Aerospace embodied intelligence aims to empower unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aerospace platforms to achieve autonomous perception, cognition, and action, as well as egocentric active interaction with humans and the environment. The aerospace embodied world model serves as an effective means to realize the autonomous intelligence of UAVs and represents a necessary pathway toward aerospace embodied intelligence. However, existing embodied world models primarily focus on ground-level intelligent agents in indoor scenarios, while research on UAV intelligent agents remains unexplored. To address this gap, we construct the first large-scale real-world image-text pre-training dataset, AerialAgent-Ego10k, featuring urban drones from a first-person perspective. We also create a virtual image-text-pose alignment dataset, CyberAgent Ego500k, to facilitate the pre-training of the aerospace embodied world model. For the first time, we clearly define 5 downstream tasks, i.e., aerospace embodied scene awareness, spatial reasoning, navigational exploration, task planning, and motion decision, and construct corresponding instruction datasets, i.e., SkyAgent-Scene3k, SkyAgent-Reason3k, SkyAgent-Nav3k and SkyAgent-Plan3k, and SkyAgent-Act3k, for fine-tuning the aerospace embodiment world model. Simultaneously, we develop SkyAgentEval, the downstream task evaluation metrics based on GPT-4, to comprehensively, flexibly, and objectively assess the results, revealing the potential and limitations of 2D/3D visual language models in UAV-agent tasks. Furthermore, we integrate over 10 2D/3D visual-language models, 2 pre-training datasets, 5 finetuning datasets, more than 10 evaluation metrics, and a simulator into the benchmark suite, i.e., AeroVerse, which will be released to the community to promote exploration and development of aerospace embodied intelligence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alejandro Polo-Molina, David Alfaya, Jose Portela</p>
<p>Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have significantly advanced various fields by effectively recognizing patterns and solving complex problems. Despite these advancements, their interpretability remains a critical challenge, especially in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. To address this, explainable AI (XAI) has made progress in demystifying ANNs, yet interpretability alone is often insufficient. In certain applications, model predictions must align with expert-imposed requirements, sometimes exemplified by partial monotonicity constraints. While monotonic approaches are found in the literature for traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they still face difficulties in achieving both interpretability and certified partial monotonicity. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture, based on learnable activation functions parametrized as splines, has been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to MLPs. Building on this, we introduce a novel ANN architecture called MonoKAN, which is based on the KAN architecture and achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability. To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity through a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output. Our experiments demonstrate that MonoKAN not only enhances interpretability but also improves predictive performance across the majority of benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Amine Ben Hassouna, Hana Chaari, Ines Belhaj</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era where vast amounts of data are collected and processed from diverse sources, there is a growing demand for sophisticated AI systems capable of intelligently fusing and analyzing this information. To address these challenges, researchers have turned towards integrating tools into LLM-powered agents to enhance the overall information fusion process. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture, resulting in a lack of modularity and terminological inconsistencies among researchers. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework (LLM-Agent-UMF) that establishes a clear foundation for agent development from both functional and software architectural perspectives, developed and evaluated using the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF). Our framework clearly distinguishes between the different components of an LLM-based agent, setting LLMs and tools apart from a new element, the core-agent, which plays the role of central coordinator. This pivotal entity comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security -- the latter often neglected in previous works. By classifying core-agents into passive and active types based on their authoritative natures, we propose various multi-core agent architectures that combine unique characteristics of distinctive agents to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our framework by applying it to thirteen state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assess five architecture variants of our framework by designing new agent architectures that combine characteristics of state-of-the-art agents to address specific goals. ...</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yida Xiong, Kun Li, Jiameng Chen, Hongzhi Zhang, Di Lin, Yan Che, Wenbin Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: Molecular optimization (MO) is a crucial stage in drug discovery in which task-oriented generated molecules are optimized to meet practical industrial requirements. Existing mainstream MO approaches primarily utilize external property predictors to guide iterative property optimization. However, learning all molecular samples in the vast chemical space is unrealistic for predictors. As a result, errors and noise are inevitably introduced during property prediction due to the nature of approximation. This leads to discrepancy accumulation, generalization reduction and suboptimal molecular candidates. In this paper, we propose a text-guided multi-property molecular optimization method utilizing transformer-based diffusion language model (TransDLM). TransDLM leverages standardized chemical nomenclature as semantic representations of molecules and implicitly embeds property requirements into textual descriptions, thereby mitigating error propagation during diffusion process. By fusing physically and chemically detailed textual semantics with specialized molecular representations, TransDLM effectively integrates diverse information sources to guide precise optimization, which enhances the model's ability to balance structural retention and property enhancement. Additionally, the success of a case study further demonstrates TransDLM's ability to solve practical problems. Experimentally, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in maintaining molecular structural similarity and enhancing chemical properties on the benchmark dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hang Gao, Yongfeng Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: By augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools, their capacity to solve complex problems has been significantly enhanced. However, despite ongoing advancements in the parsing capabilities of LLMs, incorporating all available tools simultaneously in the prompt remains impractical due to the vast number of external tools. Consequently, it is essential to provide LLMs with a precise set of tools tailored to the specific task, considering both quantity and quality. Current tool retrieval methods primarily focus on refining the ranking list of tools and directly packaging a fixed number of top-ranked tools as the tool set. However, these approaches often fail to equip LLMs with the optimal set of tools prior to execution, since the optimal number of tools for different tasks could be different, resulting in inefficiencies such as redundant or unsuitable tools, which impede immediate access to the most relevant tools. This paper addresses the challenge of recommending precise toolsets for LLMs. We introduce the problem of tool recommendation, define its scope, and propose a novel Precision-driven Tool Recommendation (PTR) approach. PTR captures an initial, concise set of tools by leveraging historical tool bundle usage and dynamically adjusts the tool set by performing tool matching, culminating in a multi-view-based tool addition. Additionally, we present a new dataset, RecTools, and a metric, TRACC, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tool recommendation for LLMs. We further validate our design choices through comprehensive experiments, demonstrating promising accuracy across two open benchmarks and our RecTools dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Abstreiter, Sasu Tarkoma, Roberto Morabito</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid rise of Language Models (LMs) has expanded the capabilities of natural language processing, powering applications from text generation to complex decision-making. While state-of-the-art LMs often boast hundreds of billions of parameters and are primarily deployed in data centers, recent trends show a growing focus on compact models-typically under 10 billion parameters-enabled by techniques such as quantization and other model compression techniques. This shift paves the way for LMs on edge devices, offering potential benefits such as enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and improved data sovereignty. However, the inherent complexity of even these smaller models, combined with the limited computing resources of edge hardware, raises critical questions about the practical trade-offs in executing LM inference outside the cloud. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive evaluation of generative LM inference on representative CPU-based and GPU-accelerated edge devices. Our study measures key performance indicators-including memory usage, inference speed, and energy consumption-across various device configurations. Additionally, we examine throughput-energy trade-offs, cost considerations, and usability, alongside an assessment of qualitative model performance. While quantization helps mitigate memory overhead, it does not fully eliminate resource bottlenecks, especially for larger models. Our findings quantify the memory and energy constraints that must be considered for practical real-world deployments, offering concrete insights into the trade-offs between model size, inference performance, and efficiency. The exploration of LMs at the edge is still in its early stages. We hope this study provides a foundation for future research, guiding the refinement of models, the enhancement of inference efficiency, and the advancement of edge-centric AI systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hariprasath Govindarajan, Maciej K. Wozniak, Marvin Klingner, Camille Maurice, B Ravi Kiran, Senthil Yogamani</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINO have led to a paradigm shift in 2D camera-based perception towards extracting generalized features to support many downstream tasks. Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Junming Liu, Siyuan Meng, Yanting Gao, Song Mao, Pinlong Cai, Guohang Yan, Yirong Chen, Zilin Bian, Ding Wang, Botian Shi</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Zhang, Lanjun Wang, Yiwen Ma, Wenhui Li, An-An Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Text-to-Image(T2I) models typically deploy safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design instructions for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Soo Yong Lee, Hyunjin Hwang, Taekwan Kim, Yuyeong Kim, Kyuri Park, Jaemin Yoo, Denny Borsboom, Kijung Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) instantiate computations of psychopathology? An effective approach to the question hinges on addressing two factors. First, for conceptual validity, we require a general and computational account of psychopathology that is applicable to computational entities without biological embodiment or subjective experience. Second, psychopathological computations, derived from the adapted theory, need to be empirically identified within the LLM's internal processing. Thus, we establish a computational-theoretical framework to provide an account of psychopathology applicable to LLMs. Based on the framework, we conduct experiments demonstrating two key claims: first, that the computational structure of psychopathology exists in LLMs; and second, that executing this computational structure results in psychopathological functions. We further observe that as LLM size increases, the computational structure of psychopathology becomes denser and that the functions become more effective. Taken together, the empirical results corroborate our hypothesis that network-theoretic computations of psychopathology have already emerged in LLMs. This suggests that certain LLM behaviors mirroring psychopathology may not be a superficial mimicry but a feature of their internal processing. Our work shows the promise of developing a new powerful in silico model of psychopathology and also alludes to the possibility of safety threat from the AI systems with psychopathological behaviors in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Vedika Srivastava, Hemant Kumar Singh, Jaisal Singh</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces ISS-Geo142, a curated benchmark for geolocating astronaut photography captured from the International Space Station (ISS). Although the ISS position at capture time is known precisely, the specific Earth locations depicted in these images are typically not directly georeferenced, making automated localization non-trivial. ISS-Geo142 consists of 142 images with associated metadata and manually determined geographic locations, spanning a range of spatial scales and scene types.
  On top of this benchmark, we implement and evaluate three geolocation pipelines: a neural network based approach (NN-Geo) using VGG16 features and cross-correlation over map-derived Areas of Interest (AOIs), a Scale-Invariant Feature Transform based pipeline (SIFT-Match) using sliding-window feature matching on stitched high-resolution AOIs, and TerraByte, an AI system built around a GPT-4 model with vision capabilities that jointly reasons over image content and ISS coordinates. On ISS-Geo142, NN-Geo achieves a match for 75.52\% of the images under our evaluation protocol, SIFT-Match attains high precision on structurally rich scenes at substantial computational cost, and TerraByte establishes the strongest overall baseline, correctly geolocating approximately 90\% of the images while also producing human-readable geographic descriptions.
  The methods and experiments were originally developed in 2023; this manuscript is a revised and extended version that situates the work relative to subsequent advances in cross-view geo-localization and remote-sensing vision--language models. Taken together, ISS-Geo142 and these three pipelines provide a concrete, historically grounded benchmark for future work on ISS image geolocation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fay\c{c}al A\"it Aoudia, Jakob Hoydis, Merlin Nimier-David, Baptiste Nicolet, Sebastian Cammerer, Alexander Keller</p>
<p>Abstract: Sionna is an open-source, GPU-accelerated library that, as of version 0.14, incorporates a ray tracer, Sionna RT, for simulating radio wave propagation. A unique feature of Sionna RT is differentiability, enabling the calculation of gradients for the channel impulse responses (CIRs), radio maps, and other related metrics with respect to system and environmental parameters, such as material properties, antenna patterns, and array geometries. The release of Sionna 1.0 provides a complete overhaul of the ray tracer, significantly improving its speed, memory efficiency, and extensibility. This document details the algorithms employed by Sionna RT to simulate radio wave propagation efficiently, while also addressing their current limitations. Given that the computation of CIRs and radio maps requires distinct algorithms, these are detailed in separate sections. For CIRs, Sionna RT integrates shooting and bouncing of rays (SBR) with the image method and uses a hashing-based mechanism to efficiently eliminate duplicate paths. Radio maps are computed using a purely SBR-based approach.</p>

<p>Abstract: Many real-world problems (e.g., resource management, autonomous driving, drug discovery) require optimizing multiple, conflicting objectives. Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) extends classic reinforcement learning to handle multiple objectives simultaneously, yielding a set of policies that capture various trade-offs. However, the MORL field lacks complex, realistic environments and benchmarks. We introduce a water resource (Nile river basin) management case study and model it as a MORL environment. We then benchmark existing MORL algorithms on this task. Our results show that specialized water management methods outperform state-of-the-art MORL approaches, underscoring the scalability challenges MORL algorithms face in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chibueze Peace Obioma, Youcheng Sun, Mustafa A. Mustafa</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to adaptive backdoor attacks that preserve stealth by closely imitating benign update statistics. Existing defenses predominantly rely on anomaly detection in parameter or gradient space, overlooking behavioral constraints that backdoor attacks must satisfy to ensure reliable trigger activation. These anomaly-centric methods fail against adaptive attacks that normalize update magnitudes and mimic benign statistical patterns while preserving backdoor functionality, creating a fundamental detection gap. To address this limitation, this paper introduces FeRA (Federated Representative Attention) -- a novel attention-driven defense that shifts the detection paradigm from anomaly-centric to consistency-centric analysis. FeRA exploits the intrinsic need for backdoor persistence across training rounds, identifying malicious clients through suppressed representation-space variance, an orthogonal property to traditional magnitude-based statistics. The framework conducts multi-dimensional behavioral analysis combining spectral and spatial attention, directional alignment, mutual similarity, and norm inflation across two complementary detection mechanisms: consistency analysis and norm-inflation detection. Through this mechanism, FeRA isolates malicious clients that exhibit low-variance consistency or magnitude amplification. Extensive evaluation across six datasets, nine attacks, and three model architectures under both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings confirm FeRA achieves superior backdoor mitigation. Under different non-IID settings, FeRA achieved the lowest average Backdoor Accuracy (BA), about 1.67% while maintaining high clean accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art defenses.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanyu Wang, Xinrui Wu, Zijian Ding, Su Zheng, Chengyue Wang, Neha Prakriya, Tony Nowatzki, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong</p>
<p>Abstract: Even though high-level synthesis (HLS) tools mitigate the challenges of programming domain-specific accelerators (DSAs) by raising the abstraction level, optimizing hardware directive parameters remains a significant hurdle. Existing heuristic and learning-based methods struggle with adaptability and sample efficiency. We present LLM-DSE, a multi-agent framework designed specifically for optimizing HLS directives. Combining LLM with design space exploration (DSE), our explorer coordinates four agents: Router, Specialists, Arbitrator, and Critic. These multi-agent components interact with various tools to accelerate the optimization process. LLM-DSE leverages essential domain knowledge to identify efficient parameter combinations while maintaining adaptability through verbal learning from online interactions. Evaluations on the HLSyn dataset demonstrate that LLM-DSE achieves substantial $2.55\times$ performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, uncovering novel designs while reducing runtime. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed agent interactions. Our code is open-sourced here: https://github.com/Nozidoali/LLM-DSE.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zechen Li, Lanqing Yang, Yiheng Bian, Hao Pan, Yongjian Fu, Yezhou Wang, Zhuxi Chen, Yi-Chao Chen, Guangtao Xue</p>
<p>Abstract: Indoor environments typically contain diverse RF signals distributed across multiple frequency bands, including NB-IoT, Wi-Fi, and millimeter-wave. Consequently, wideband RF modeling is essential for practical applications such as joint deployment of heterogeneous RF systems, cross-band communication, and distributed RF sensing. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques effectively reconstruct RF radiance fields at a single frequency, they cannot model fields at arbitrary or unknown frequencies across a wide range. In this paper, we present a novel 3DGS algorithm for unified wideband RF radiance field modeling. RF wave propagation depends on signal frequency and the 3D spatial environment, including geometry and material electromagnetic (EM) properties. To address these factors, we introduce a frequency-embedded EM feature network that utilizes 3D Gaussian spheres at each spatial location to learn the relationship between frequency and transmission characteristics, such as attenuation and radiance intensity. With a dataset containing sparse frequency samples in a specific 3D environment, our model can efficiently reconstruct RF radiance fields at arbitrary and unseen frequencies. To assess our approach, we introduce a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset with 50,000 samples spanning 1 to 94 GHz across six indoor environments. Experimental results show that the proposed model trained on multiple frequencies achieves a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.922 for PAS reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art single-frequency 3DGS models with SSIM of 0.863.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuxin Ren, Maxwell D Collins, Miao Hu, Huanrui Yang</p>
<p>Abstract: While transformers dominate modern vision and language models, their attention mechanism remains poorly suited for in-memory computing (IMC) devices due to intensive activation-to-activation multiplications and non-local memory access, leading to substantial latency and bandwidth overhead on ReRAM-based accelerators. To address this mismatch, we propose FAR, a Function-preserving Attention Replacement framework that substitutes all attention in pretrained DeiTs with sequential modules inherently compatible with IMC dataflows. Specifically, FAR replaces self-attention with a multi-head bidirectional LSTM architecture via block-wise distillation to retain functional equivalence while enabling linear-time computation and localized weight reuse. We further incorporate structured pruning on FAR models, enabling flexible adaptation to resource-constrained IMC arrays while maintaining functional fidelity. Evaluations on the DeiT family demonstrate that FAR maintains comparable accuracy to the original attention-based models on ImageNet and multiple downstream tasks with reduced parameters and latency. Further analysis shows that FAR preserves the semantic token relationships learned by attention while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for energy-efficient transformer inference on IMC-based edge accelerators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohammadhossein Homaei, Mehran Tarif, Agustin Di Bartolo, Victor Gonzalez Morales, Mar Avila Vegas</p>
<p>Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has a lot of problems, like low bandwidth, high latency, mobility, and not enough energy. Routing protocols that were made for land-based networks, like RPL, don't work well in these underwater settings. This paper talks about RL-RPL-UA, a new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to make things work better in underwater situations. Each node has a small RL agent that picks the best parent node depending on local data such the link quality, buffer level, packet delivery ratio, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA works with all standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function to help people make decisions in real time. Aqua-Sim simulations demonstrate that RL-RPL-UA boosts packet delivery by up to 9.2%, uses 14.8% less energy per packet, and adds 80 seconds to the network's lifetime compared to previous approaches. These results show that RL-RPL-UA is a potential and energy-efficient way to route data in underwater networks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Patryk Krukowski, {\L}ukasz Gorczyca, Piotr Helm, Kamil Ksi\k{a}\.zek, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek</p>
<p>Abstract: Continual learning under adversarial conditions remains an open problem, as existing methods often compromise either robustness, scalability, or both. We propose a novel framework that integrates Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) with a hypernetwork-based architecture to enable certifiably robust continual learning across sequential tasks. Our method, SHIELD, generates task-specific model parameters via a shared hypernetwork conditioned solely on compact task embeddings, eliminating the need for replay buffers or full model copies and enabling efficient over time. To further enhance robustness, we introduce Interval MixUp, a novel training strategy that blends virtual examples represented as $\ell_{\infty}$ balls centered around MixUp points. Leveraging interval arithmetic, this technique guarantees certified robustness while mitigating the wrapping effect, resulting in smoother decision boundaries. We evaluate SHIELD under strong white-box adversarial attacks, including PGD and AutoAttack, across multiple benchmarks. It consistently outperforms existing robust continual learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art average accuracy while maintaining both scalability and certification. These results represent a significant step toward practical and theoretically grounded continual learning in adversarial settings.</p>

<p>Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness. We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning. Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements, suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Ray,  Ashesh, Florian Jug</p>
<p>Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 11 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haining Wang, Jason Clark, Yueru Yan, Star Bradley, Ruiyang Chen, Yiqiong Zhang, Hengyi Fu, Zuoyu Tian</p>
<p>Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably, regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We find no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrate nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhipeng He, Alexander Stevens, Chun Ouyang, Johannes De Smedt, Alistair Barros, Catarina Moreira</p>
<p>Abstract: Adversarial attacks on tabular data present unique challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions. To address this, we propose a latent-space perturbation framework using a mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate statistically consistent adversarial examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve statistical consistency. We introduce In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to jointly evaluate attack effectiveness and distributional alignment. Evaluation across six publicly available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted from image domain approaches, achieving substantially lower outlier rates and higher IDSR across six datasets and three model architectures. Our comprehensive analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control, and generative architecture demonstrate that the effectiveness of VAE-based attacks depends strongly on reconstruction quality and the availability of sufficient training data. When these conditions are met, the proposed framework achieves superior practical utility and stability compared with input-space methods. This work underscores the importance of maintaining on-manifold perturbations for generating realistic and robust adversarial examples in tabular domains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Aaron Councilman, David Jiahao Fu, Aryan Gupta, Chengxiao Wang, David Grove, Yu-Xiong Wang, Vikram Adve</p>
<p>Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However, the reliability of LLM code generation and current validation techniques for it are far from strong enough to be used for mission-critical or safety-critical applications. In this work we explore ways to offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees could improve the quality of general AI Code Assistants and support their use for critical applications. To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a Formal Query Language that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. We then have a formal specification of the user intent which we can use to verify that LLM-generated code matches the user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the Ansible programming language, widely used for system administration, including for critical systems. The system includes an intuitive formal query language, a calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic interpreter and a unification algorithm which together are used for the verification. A key innovation in Astrogator is the use of a Knowledge Base to capture system-specific implementation dependencies that greatly reduce the need for system knowledge in expressing formal queries. On a benchmark suite of 21 code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jianxiang He, Meisheng Hong, Jungang Li, Ziyang Chen, Weiyu Guo, Xuming Hu, Hui Xiong</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in vision-language tasks, yet their processing of long videos is constrained by input context length and high computational costs. Sparse frame sampling thus becomes a necessary preprocessing step, with sampled frame quality directly impacting downstream performance. Existing keyframe search algorithms achieve a balance between efficiency and sampled frame quality but heavily rely on the visual modality alone. This makes them difficult to adapt to text-related tasks and often leads to retrieval results deviating from core semantic content. To address this, we propose the VISUAL-SUBTITLE INTEGRATION (VSI), a multimodal keyframe retrieval framework. It employs a dual-branch collaborative retrieval approach combining Video Search and Subtitle Match to fuse complementary visual and textual information for precise localization. Experiments on LongVideoBench and VideoMME demonstrate that VSI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in keyframe retrieval while delivering breakthrough performance in text-related tasks and exhibiting strong generalization across other tasks.</p>

Task-specific processing is dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks. Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaehwan Jeong, Tuan-Anh Vu, Mohammad Jony, Shahab Ahmad, Md. Mukhlesur Rahman, Sangpil Kim, M. Khalid Jawed</p>
<p>Abstract: Advances in AI and Robotics have accelerated significant initiatives in agriculture, particularly in the areas of robot navigation and 3D digital twin creation. A significant bottleneck impeding this progress is the critical lack of "in-the-wild" datasets that capture the full complexities of real farmland, including non-rigid motion from wind, drastic illumination variance, and morphological changes resulting from growth. This data gap fundamentally limits research on robust AI models for autonomous field navigation and scene-level dynamic 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a modular robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture these dynamic farmland conditions. Our platform integrates multiple sensors, enabling remote, time-synchronized acquisition of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, IMU, and Pose data for efficient and repeatable long-term data collection in real-world agricultural environments. We successfully collected 18TB of data over one month, documenting the entire growth cycle of Canola under diverse illumination conditions. We benchmark state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods on AgriChrono, revealing the profound challenge of reconstructing high-fidelity, dynamic non-rigid scenes in such farmland settings. This benchmark validates AgriChrono as a critical asset for advancing model generalization, and its public release is expected to significantly accelerate research and development in precision agriculture.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Praneet Suresh, Jack Stanley, Sonia Joseph, Luca Scimeca, Danilo Bzdok</p>
<p>Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science, business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic quantification of a model's hallucination risk.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Danilo Francati, Yevin Nikhel Goonatilake, Shubham Pawar, Daniele Venturi, Giuseppe Ateniese</p>
<p>Abstract: We ask a basic question about cryptographic watermarking for generative models: to what extent can a watermark remain reliable when an adversary is allowed to corrupt the encoded signal? To study this question, we introduce a minimal coding abstraction that we call a zero-bit tamper-detection code. This is a secret-key procedure that samples a pseudorandom codeword and, given a candidate word, decides whether it should be treated as unmarked content or as the result of tampering with a valid codeword. It captures the two core requirements of robust watermarking: soundness and tamper detection.
  Within this abstraction we prove a sharp unconditional limit on robustness to independent symbol corruption. For an alphabet of size $q$, there is a critical corruption rate of $1 - 1/q$ such that no scheme with soundness, even relaxed to allow a fixed constant false positive probability on random content, can reliably detect tampering once an adversary can change more than this fraction of symbols. In particular, in the binary case no cryptographic watermark can remain robust if more than half of the encoded bits are modified. We also show that this threshold is tight by giving simple information-theoretic constructions that achieve soundness and tamper detection for all strictly smaller corruption rates.
  We then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually intact.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Elena Camuffo, Francesco Barbato, Mete Ozay, Simone Milani, Umberto Michieli</p>
<p>Abstract: Personalized object detection aims to adapt a general-purpose detector to recognize user-specific instances from only a few examples. Lightweight models often struggle in this setting due to their weak semantic priors, while large vision-language models (VLMs) offer strong object-level understanding but are too computationally demanding for real-time or on-device applications. We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a distillation framework that transfers multimodal region-level knowledge from a frozen VLM teacher into a lightweight vision-only detector. MOCHA extracts fused visual and textual teacher's embeddings and uses them to guide student training through a dual-objective loss that enforces accurate local alignment and global relational consistency across regions. This process enables efficient transfer of semantics without the need for teacher modifications or textual input at inference. MOCHA consistently outperforms prior baselines across four personalized detection benchmarks under strict few-shot regimes, yielding a +10.1 average improvement, with minimal inference cost.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ansh Nagda, Prabhakar Raghavan, Abhradeep Thakurta</p>
<p>Abstract: Can AI based methods help us make advances in complexity theory? We provide evidence towards answering this in the affirmative, using AlphaEvolve (an LLM code mutation agent) to obtain new results in three settings:
  a) We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ vertices, and our upper bounds are obtained via analytical arguments.
  b) We obtain new inapproximability results for MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate them within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP (rather than a reduction from ``standard'' H{\aa}stad-style PCPs).
  c) Inapproximability for the metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum cost tour within a factor of $111/110$ using AlphaEvolve to discover a new gadget, thus improving the SOTA of $117/116$. Along the way, we provide new modular soundness and completeness arguments that can be of independent interest.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (sometimes requiring time exponential in the size of the construction). We used AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$ for our gadgets). Our results suggest that gadget based proofs would benefit from a pass through AI-based tools to obtain stronger results.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Roussel Rahman, Jeff Shrager</p>
<p>Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT; Siegler and Shrager, 1984; Siegler, 2000) explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data, probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting practice, symbol (number) embedding, and gated attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like'' use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.</p>

Current biomedical question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making. We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based, long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT, MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weikai Huang, Jieyu Zhang, Taoyang Jia, Chenhao Zheng, Ziqi Gao, Jae Sung Park, Winson Han, Ranjay Krishna</p>
<p>Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized through tasks such as instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- enables applications ranging from robotic perception to photo editing. These fundamental problems in computer vision are powered by large-scale, painstakingly annotated datasets. Despite their impact, these datasets are costly to build, biased in coverage, and difficult to scale. Synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative but struggle with flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We introduce Synthetic Object Compositions (SOC), an accurate and scalable data synthesis pipeline via a novel object-centric composition strategy. It composes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using 3D geometric layout augmentation and camera configuration augmentation with generative harmonization and mask-area-weighted blending, yielding accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions.
  Models trained on just 100K of our synthetic images outperform those trained on larger real datasets (GRIT 20M, V3Det 200K) and synthetic pipelines (Copy-Paste, X-Paste, SynGround, SegGen) by +24-36% -- achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS and +8.4 NAcc on gRefCOCO. Beyond the general open-vocabulary setup, SOC also enables controllable dataset construction for different use cases and boosts performance in both low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios.
  Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments delivers strong performance across different real-data scales and yields even greater improvements under extremely limited real-data conditions, including +6.59 AP on a 1% COCO data setup. Furthermore, this controllability enables targeted data generation for intra-class referring, a diagnostic grounding task we propose that requires fine-grained attribute discrimination.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Pablo Miralles-Gonz\'alez, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Mart\'in, David Camacho</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover, performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827">Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL with GRPO</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Ashish Kattamuri, Ishita Prasad, Meetu Malhotra, Arpita Vats, Rahul Raja, Albert Lie</p>
<p>Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results. Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from 81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training datasets.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chiyu Chen, Xinhao Song, Yunkai Chai, Yang Yao, Haodong Zhao, Lijun Li, Jie Li, Yan Teng, Gongshen Liu, Yingchun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector: environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence, pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more robust and secure embodied agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Zhang, Tairen Zhang, Lanjun Wang, Ruidong Chen, Wenhui Li, Anan Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Using risky text prompts, such as pornography and violent prompts, to test the safety of text-to-image (T2I) models is a critical task. However, existing risky prompt datasets are limited in three key areas: 1) limited risky categories, 2) coarse-grained annotation, and 3) low effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce T2I-RiskyPrompt, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating safety-related tasks in T2I models. Specifically, we first develop a hierarchical risk taxonomy, which consists of 6 primary categories and 14 fine-grained subcategories. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct a pipeline to collect and annotate risky prompts. Finally, we obtain 6,432 effective risky prompts, where each prompt is annotated with both hierarchical category labels and detailed risk reasons. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation, we propose a reason-driven risky image detection method that explicitly aligns the MLLM with safety annotations. Based on T2I-RiskyPrompt, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight T2I models, nine defense methods, five safety filters, and five attack strategies, offering nine key insights into the strengths and limitations of T2I model safety. Finally, we discuss potential applications of T2I-RiskyPrompt across various research fields. The dataset and code are provided in https://github.com/datar001/T2I-RiskyPrompt.</p>

<p>Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anirban Ray, Vera Galinova, Florian Jug</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here, we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4 diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results, demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases, enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.</p>

<p>Abstract: Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose BioRiskEval, a framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. BioRiskEval assesses models' virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Guojian Zhan, Likun Wang, Xiangteng Zhang, Jiaxin Gao, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Shengbo Eben Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Online planning has proven effective in reinforcement learning (RL) for improving sample efficiency and final performance. However, using planning for environment interaction inevitably introduces a divergence between the collected data and the policy's actual behaviors, degrading both model learning and policy improvement. To address this, we propose BOOM (Bootstrap Off-policy with WOrld Model), a framework that tightly integrates planning and off-policy learning through a bootstrap loop: the policy initializes the planner, and the planner refines actions to bootstrap the policy through behavior alignment. This loop is supported by a jointly learned world model, which enables the planner to simulate future trajectories and provides value targets to facilitate policy improvement. The core of BOOM is a likelihood-free alignment loss that bootstraps the policy using the planner's non-parametric action distribution, combined with a soft value-weighted mechanism that prioritizes high-return behaviors and mitigates variability in the planner's action quality within the replay buffer. Experiments on the high-dimensional DeepMind Control Suite and Humanoid-Bench show that BOOM achieves state-of-the-art results in both training stability and final performance.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yan Sun, Jia Guo, Stanley Kok, Zihao Wang, Zujie Wen, Zhiqiang Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning ability of large language models, yet training remains costly because many rollouts contribute little to optimization, considering the amount of computation required. This study investigates how simply leveraging intrinsic data properties, almost free benefit during training, can improve data efficiency for RLVR. We propose PREPO with two complementary components. First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines. Beyond empirical gains, we provide theoretical and in-depth analyses explaining the underlying rationale of our method to improve the data efficiency of RLVR.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Stergios Plataniotis, Charilaos Akasiadis, Georgios Chalkiadakis</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI) within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly, without introducing extra hyperparameters.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shaowen Wang, Yiqi Dong, Ruinian Chang, Tansheng Zhu, Yuebo Sun, Kaifeng Lyu, Jian Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite substantial advances, large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet incorrect responses. In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Zheng, Yidan Hu</p>
<p>Abstract: AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and, often without explicit user consent, collect or disclose users' sensitive local data, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although AI agents' privacy policies describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual tool that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance with stated privacy policies.
  AudAgent consists of four components for automated privacy auditing of AI agents. (i) Policy formalization: a novel cross-LLM voting mechanism to guarantee confidence of the parsed privacy policy model. (ii) Runtime annotation: a lightweight Presidio-based analyzer detects sensitive data and annotates data practices based on the AI agent's context and the privacy policy model. (iii) Compliance auditing: ontology graphs and automata-based checking connect the privacy policy model with runtime annotations, enabling on-the-fly compliance checking. (iv) User interface: an infrastructure-independent implementation visualizes the real-time execution trace of AI agents along with potential privacy policy violations, providing user-friendly transparency and accountability.
  We evaluate AudAgent with AI agents built using mainstream frameworks, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and visualizing privacy policy violations in real time. Using AudAgent, we also find that most privacy policies omit explicit safeguards for highly sensitive data such as SSNs, whose misuse violates legal requirements, and that many agents do not refuse handling such data via third-party tools, including those controlled by Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. AudAgent proactively blocks operations on such data, overriding the agents' original privacy policy and behavior.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shourya Batra, Pierce Tillman, Samarth Gaggar, Shashank Kesineni, Kevin Zhu, Sunishchal Dev, Ashwinee Panda, Vasu Sharma, Maheep Chaudhary</p>
<p>Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into personal assistants with access to sensitive user data, they face a critical privacy challenge: while prior work has addressed output-level privacy, recent findings reveal that LLMs often leak private information through their internal reasoning processes, violating contextual privacy expectations. These leaky thoughts occur when models inadvertently expose sensitive details in their reasoning traces, even when final outputs appear safe. The challenge lies in preventing such leakage without compromising the model's reasoning capabilities, requiring a delicate balance between privacy and utility. We introduce Steering Activations towards Leakage-free Thinking (SALT), a lightweight test-time intervention that mitigates privacy leakage in model's Chain of Thought (CoT) by injecting targeted steering vectors into hidden state. We identify the high-leakage layers responsible for this behavior. Through experiments across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that SALT achieves reductions including $18.2\%$ reduction in CPL on QwQ-32B, $17.9\%$ reduction in CPL on Llama-3.1-8B, and $31.2\%$ reduction in CPL on Deepseek in contextual privacy leakage dataset AirGapAgent-R while maintaining comparable task performance and utility. Our work establishes SALT as a practical approach for test-time privacy protection in reasoning-capable language models, offering a path toward safer deployment of LLM-based personal agents.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dongdong Zhao, Qiben Xu, Ranxin Fang, Baogang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep hashing improves retrieval efficiency through compact binary codes, yet it introduces severe and often overlooked privacy risks. The ability to reconstruct original training data from hash codes could lead to serious threats such as biometric forgery and privacy breaches. However, model inversion attacks specifically targeting deep hashing models remain unexplored, leaving their security implications unexamined. This research gap stems from the inaccessibility of genuine training hash codes and the highly discrete Hamming space, which prevents existing methods from adapting to deep hashing. To address these challenges, we propose DHMI, the first diffusion-based model inversion framework designed for deep hashing. DHMI first clusters an auxiliary dataset to derive semantic hash centers as surrogate anchors. It then introduces a surrogate-guided denoising optimization method that leverages a novel attack metric (fusing classification consistency and hash proximity) to dynamically select candidate samples. A cluster of surrogate models guides the refinement of these candidates, ensuring the generation of high-fidelity and semantically consistent images. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DHMI successfully reconstructs high-resolution, high-quality images even under the most challenging black-box setting, where no training hash codes are available. Our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art model inversion attacks in black-box scenarios, confirming both its practical efficacy and the critical privacy risks inherent in deep hashing systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nathan Breslow, Aayush Mishra, Mahler Revsine, Michael C. Schatz, Anqi Liu, Daniel Khashabi</p>
<p>Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?
  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13646">Live-SWE-agent: Can Software Engineering Agents Self-Evolve on the Fly?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chunqiu Steven Xia, Zhe Wang, Yan Yang, Yuxiang Wei, Lingming Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-G\"odel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that LIVE-SWE-AGENT can achieve an impressive solve rate of 77.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing software agents, including the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> E. Zhixuan Zeng, Yuhao Chen, Alexander Wong</p>
<p>Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.</p>

While some existing 3D viewers allow creators to provide alternative text, they often lack sufficient detail about the 3D models. Grounded on a formative study, this paper introduces SweeperBot, a system that enables SR users to leverage visual question answering to explore and compare 3D models. SweeperBot answers SR users' visual questions by combining an optimal view selection technique with the strength of generative- and recognition-based foundation models. An expert review with 10 Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users with SR experience demonstrated the feasibility of using SweeperBot to assist BLV users in exploring and comparing 3D models. The quality of the descriptions generated by SweeperBot was validated by a second survey study with 30 sighted participants.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sejuti Rahman, Swakshar Deb, MD. Sameer Iqbal Chowdhury, MD. Jubair Ahmed Sourov, Mohammad Shamsuddin</p>
<p>Abstract: Depression is a prevalent global mental health disorder, characterised by persistent low mood and anhedonia. However, it remains underdiagnosed because current diagnostic methods depend heavily on subjective clinical assessments. To enable objective detection, we introduce a gold standard dataset of 103 clinically assessed participants collected through a tripartite data approach which uniquely integrated eye tracking data with audio and video to give a comprehensive representation of depressive symptoms. Eye tracking data quantifies the attentional bias towards negative stimuli that is frequently observed in depressed groups. Audio and video data capture the affective flattening and psychomotor retardation characteristic of depression. Statistical validation confirmed their significant discriminative power in distinguishing depressed from non depressed groups. We address a critical limitation of existing graph-based models that focus on low-frequency information and propose a Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN). This framework consists of a novel Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM), which can leverage both low and high frequency signals. Extensive evaluation against traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks demonstrates that MF-GCN consistently outperforms baselines. In binary classification, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94. For the 3 class classification task, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 and siginificantly suprassed other models. To validate generalizability, the model was also evaluated on the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) dataset and achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96. These results confirm that our trimodal, multi frequency framework effectively captures cross modal interaction for accurate depression detection.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chao Yu, Qixin Tan, Jiaxuan Gao, Shi Yu, Hong Lu, Xinting Yang, Zelai Xu, Yu Wang, Yi Wu, Eugene Vinitsky</p>
<p>Abstract: Reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) has recently revealed a new scaling effect: test-time scaling. Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Charlotte Stix, Annika Hallensleben, Alejandro Ortega, Matteo Pistillo</p>
<p>Abstract: This research report addresses the absence of an actionable definition for Loss of Control (LoC) in AI systems by developing a novel taxonomy and preparedness framework. Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rongxin Cheng, Kai Zhou, Xingda Wei, Siyuan Liu, Mingcong Han, Mingjing Ai, Yeju Zhou, Baoquan Zhong, Wencong Xiao, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. SpecActor achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast path (e.g., a smaller model) to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges in speculative rollout by (1) a \emph{dynamic decoupled speculation} execution method that maximizes the GPU computational efficiency to realize speedup for large-batch execution -- a configuration common in training but unfriendly to speculative execution and (2) a \emph{dynamic Best-of-N speculation} method that selects and combines different drafting methods according to the rollout progress. It substantially improves the speculation accuracy even when the best drafting method is unknown a priori, meanwhile without requiring adding extra computation resources. {\sys} is {1.7}\,$\times$ faster than veRL in end-to-end training, and is {1.3--1.5}\,$\times$ faster compared to baselines with speculative decoding.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ziyan Liu, Yeqiu Chen, Hongyi Cai, Tao Lin, Shuo Yang, Zheng Liu, Bo Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jaime \'Alvarez Urue\~na, David Camacho, Javier Huertas Tato</p>
<p>Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70% and 4.27% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.</p>

<p>Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA through DSPy to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $\kappa$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.</p>
