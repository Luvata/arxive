<p><b>Authors:</b> Graham Findlay, William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Isaac David, William GP Mayner, Christof Koch, Giulio Tononi</p>
<p>Abstract: Developments in machine learning and computing power suggest that artificial general intelligence is within reach. This raises the question of artificial consciousness: if a computer were to be functionally equivalent to a human, being able to do all we do, would it experience sights, sounds, and thoughts, as we do when we are conscious? Answering this question in a principled manner can only be done on the basis of a theory of consciousness that is grounded in phenomenology and that states the necessary and sufficient conditions for any system, evolved or engineered, to support subjective experience. Here we employ Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which provides principled tools to determine whether a system is conscious, to what degree, and the content of its experience. We consider pairs of systems constituted of simple Boolean units, one of which -- a basic stored-program computer -- simulates the other with full functional equivalence. By applying the principles of IIT, we demonstrate that (i) two systems can be functionally equivalent without being phenomenally equivalent, and (ii) that this conclusion is not dependent on the simulated system's function. We further demonstrate that, according to IIT, it is possible for a digital computer to simulate our behavior, possibly even by simulating the neurons in our brain, without replicating our experience. This contrasts sharply with computational functionalism, the thesis that performing computations of the right kind is necessary and sufficient for consciousness.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Francois Chollet, Mike Knoop, Gregory Kamradt, Bryan Landers</p>
<p>Abstract: As of December 2024, the ARC-AGI benchmark is five years old and remains unbeaten. We believe it is currently the most important unsolved AI benchmark in the world because it seeks to measure generalization on novel tasks -- the essence of intelligence -- as opposed to skill at tasks that can be prepared for in advance. This year, we launched ARC Prize, a global competition to inspire new ideas and drive open progress towards AGI by reaching a target benchmark score of 85\%. As a result, the state-of-the-art score on the ARC-AGI private evaluation set increased from 33\% to 55.5\%, propelled by several frontier AGI reasoning techniques including deep learning-guided program synthesis and test-time training. In this paper, we survey top approaches, review new open-source implementations, discuss the limitations of the ARC-AGI-1 dataset, and share key insights gained from the competition.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04606">Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification for Factuality in Radiology Report Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Chenyu Wang, Weichao Zhou, Shantanu Ghosh, Kayhan Batmanghelich, Wenchao Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) has shown great potential in assisting radiologists by automating the labor-intensive task of report writing. While recent advancements have improved the quality and coherence of generated reports, ensuring their factual correctness remains a critical challenge. Although generative medical Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have been proposed to address this issue, these models are prone to hallucinations and can produce inaccurate diagnostic information. To address these concerns, we introduce a novel Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification framework that provides both report-level and sentence-level uncertainties. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require modifications to the underlying model or access to its inner state, such as output token logits, thus serving as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in detecting hallucinations and enhancing the factual accuracy of automatically generated radiology reports. By abstaining from high-uncertainty reports, our approach improves factuality scores by $10$%, achieved by rejecting $20$% of reports using the Radialog model on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Furthermore, sentence-level uncertainty flags the lowest-precision sentence in each report with an $82.9$% success rate.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04645">REL: Working out is all you need</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Toby Simonds, Jey Han Lau, Chaithanya Bandi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments, particularly OpenAI's O1 model, have demonstrated the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks. Through analysis of O1's outputs and provided sample Chain-of-Thought (CoT) demonstrations, we observe that it approaches problem-solving in a distinctly human-like manner, systematically brainstorming ideas, testing hypotheses, verifying results, and planning comprehensive solutions. These sophisticated reasoning capabilities remain notably absent in other state-of-the-art language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that this performance gap stems from the limited availability of high-quality reasoning process data in current training sets. We demonstrate that by constructing a specialized dataset focused on explicit problem-solving workflows ("worked solutions"), we can elicit substantially improved planning capabilities from existing models. Additionally, we propose the Reasoning Enhancement Loop (REL), a method for generating synthetic worked solutions.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04655">From Models to Systems: A Comprehensive Fairness Framework for Compositional Recommender Systems</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Brian Hsu, Cyrus DiCiccio, Natesh Sivasubramoniapillai, Hongseok Namkoong</p>
<p>Abstract: Fairness research in machine learning often centers on ensuring equitable performance of individual models. However, real-world recommendation systems are built on multiple models and even multiple stages, from candidate retrieval to scoring and serving, which raises challenges for responsible development and deployment. This system-level view, as highlighted by regulations like the EU AI Act, necessitates moving beyond auditing individual models as independent entities. We propose a holistic framework for modeling system-level fairness, focusing on the end-utility delivered to diverse user groups, and consider interactions between components such as retrieval and scoring models. We provide formal insights on the limitations of focusing solely on model-level fairness and highlight the need for alternative tools that account for heterogeneity in user preferences. To mitigate system-level disparities, we adapt closed-box optimization tools (e.g., BayesOpt) to jointly optimize utility and equity. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic and real datasets, underscoring the need for a system-level framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nan Sun, Yuantian Miao, Hao Jiang, Ming Ding, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the complex interaction between innovation and regulation has become an emerging focus of our society. Despite tremendous advancements in AI's capabilities to excel in specific tasks and contribute to diverse sectors, establishing a high degree of trust in AI-generated outputs and decisions necessitates meticulous caution and continuous oversight. A broad spectrum of stakeholders, including governmental bodies, private sector corporations, academic institutions, and individuals, have launched significant initiatives. These efforts include developing ethical guidelines for AI and engaging in vibrant discussions on AI ethics, both among AI practitioners and within the broader society. This article thoroughly analyzes the ground-breaking AI regulatory framework proposed by the European Union. It delves into the fundamental ethical principles of safety, transparency, non-discrimination, traceability, and environmental sustainability for AI developments and deployments. Considering the technical efforts and strategies undertaken by academics and industry to uphold these principles, we explore the synergies and conflicts among the five ethical principles. Through this lens, work presents a forward-looking perspective on the future of AI regulations, advocating for a harmonized approach that safeguards societal values while encouraging technological advancement.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Neel Guha, Mayee F. Chen, Trevor Chow, Ishan S. Khare, Christopher R\'e</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where LLM inputs may span many different tasks. Recent work has found that the choice of LLM is consequential, and different LLMs may be good for different input samples. Prior approaches have thus explored how engineers might select an LLM to use for each sample (i.e. routing). While existing routing methods mostly require training auxiliary models on human-annotated data, our work explores whether it is possible to perform unsupervised routing. We propose Smoothie, a weak supervision-inspired routing approach that requires no labeled data. Given a set of outputs from different LLMs, Smoothie constructs a latent variable graphical model over embedding representations of observable LLM outputs and unknown "true" outputs. Using this graphical model, we estimate sample-dependent quality scores for each LLM, and route each sample to the LLM with the highest corresponding score. We find that Smoothie's LLM quality-scores correlate with ground-truth model quality (correctly identifying the optimal model on 9/14 tasks), and that Smoothie outperforms baselines for routing by up to 10 points accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rui Zhou, Yanxia Zhang, Chenyang Yuan, Frank Permenter, Nikos Arechiga, Matt Klenk, Faez Ahmed</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces a generative model designed for multimodal control over text-to-image foundation generative AI models such as Stable Diffusion, specifically tailored for engineering design synthesis. Our model proposes parametric, image, and text control modalities to enhance design precision and diversity. Firstly, it handles both partial and complete parametric inputs using a diffusion model that acts as a design autocomplete co-pilot, coupled with a parametric encoder to process the information. Secondly, the model utilizes assembly graphs to systematically assemble input component images, which are then processed through a component encoder to capture essential visual data. Thirdly, textual descriptions are integrated via CLIP encoding, ensuring a comprehensive interpretation of design intent. These diverse inputs are synthesized through a multimodal fusion technique, creating a joint embedding that acts as the input to a module inspired by ControlNet. This integration allows the model to apply robust multimodal control to foundation models, facilitating the generation of complex and precise engineering designs. This approach broadens the capabilities of AI-driven design tools and demonstrates significant advancements in precise control based on diverse data modalities for enhanced design generation.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04718">Adaptive Optimization for Enhanced Efficiency in Large-Scale Language Model Training</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Jiajing Chen, Bingying Liu, Xiaoxuan Liao, Jia Gao, Hongye Zheng, Yue Li</p>
<p>Abstract: With the rapid development of natural language processing technology, large-scale language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable results in a variety of tasks. However, how to effectively train these huge models and improve their performance and computational efficiency remains an important challenge. This paper proposes an improved method based on adaptive optimization algorithm, aiming to improve the training efficiency and final performance of LLM. Through comparative experiments on the SQuAD and GLUE data sets, the experimental results show that compared with traditional optimization algorithms (such as SGD, Momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp and Adam), the adaptive optimization algorithm we proposed has better accuracy and F1 score. Both have achieved significant improvements, especially showed stronger training capabilities when processed large-scale texts and complex tasks. The research results verify the advantages of adaptive optimization algorithms in large-scale language model training and provide new ideas and directions for future optimization methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqian Yang, Shusen Yang, Cong Zhao, Zongben Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: Telecommunication Networks (TNs) have become the most important infrastructure for data communications over the last century. Operations and maintenance (O&M) is extremely important to ensure the availability, effectiveness, and efficiency of TN communications. Different from the popular O&M technique for IT systems (e.g., the cloud), artificial intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), O&M for TNs meets the following three fundamental challenges: topological dependence of network components, highly heterogeneous software, and restricted failure data. This article presents TelOps, the first AI-driven O&M framework for TNs, systematically enhanced with mechanism, data, and empirical knowledge. We provide a comprehensive comparison between TelOps and AIOps, and conduct a proof-of-concept case study on a typical O&M task (failure diagnosis) for a real industrial TN. As the first systematic AI-driven O&M framework for TNs, TelOps opens a new door to applying AI techniques to TN automation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihui Li, Xiaoyue Yan, Hao Zhou, Borong Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: In recent years, the critical role of green buildings in addressing energy consumption and environmental issues has become widely acknowledged. Research indicates that over 40% of potential energy savings can be achieved during the early design stage. Therefore, decision-making in green building design (DGBD), which is based on modeling and performance simulation, is crucial for reducing building energy costs. However, the field of green building encompasses a broad range of specialized knowledge, which involves significant learning costs and results in low decision-making efficiency. Many studies have already applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods to this field. Based on previous research, this study innovatively integrates large language models with DGBD, creating GreenQA, a question answering framework for multimodal data reasoning. Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation, Chain of Thought, and Function Call methods, GreenQA enables multimodal question answering, including weather data analysis and visualization, retrieval of green building cases, and knowledge query. Additionally, this study conducted a user survey using the GreenQA web platform. The results showed that 96% of users believed the platform helped improve design efficiency. This study not only effectively supports DGBD but also provides inspiration for AI-assisted design.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matt MacDermott, James Fox, Francesco Belardinelli, Tom Everitt</p>
<p>Abstract: We define maximum entropy goal-directedness (MEG), a formal measure of goal-directedness in causal models and Markov decision processes, and give algorithms for computing it. Measuring goal-directedness is important, as it is a critical element of many concerns about harm from AI. It is also of philosophical interest, as goal-directedness is a key aspect of agency. MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of random variables. We prove that MEG satisfies several desiderata and demonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh Sridhar, Souradeep Dutta, Dinesh Jayaraman, Insup Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Building generalist agents that can rapidly adapt to new environments is a key challenge for deploying AI in the digital and real worlds. Is scaling current agent architectures the most effective way to build generalist agents? We propose a novel approach to pre-train relatively small policies on relatively small datasets and adapt them to unseen environments via in-context learning, without any finetuning. Our key idea is that retrieval offers a powerful bias for fast adaptation. Indeed, we demonstrate that even a simple retrieval-based 1-nearest neighbor agent offers a surprisingly strong baseline for today's state-of-the-art generalist agents. From this starting point, we construct a semi-parametric agent, REGENT, that trains a transformer-based policy on sequences of queries and retrieved neighbors. REGENT can generalize to unseen robotics and game-playing environments via retrieval augmentation and in-context learning, achieving this with up to 3x fewer parameters and up to an order-of-magnitude fewer pre-training datapoints, significantly outperforming today's state-of-the-art generalist agents.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiyu Pan, Neda Mohammadi, John E. Taylor</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurate short-term streamflow and flood forecasting are critical for mitigating river flood impacts, especially given the increasing climate variability. Machine learning-based streamflow forecasting relies on large streamflow datasets derived from rating curves. Uncertainties in rating curve modeling could introduce errors to the streamflow data and affect the forecasting accuracy. This study proposes a streamflow forecasting method that addresses these data errors, enhancing the accuracy of river flood forecasting and flood modeling, thereby reducing flood-related risk. A convolutional recurrent neural network is used to capture spatiotemporal patterns, coupled with residual error learning and forecasting. The neural network outperforms commonly used forecasting models over 1-6 hours of forecasting horizons, and the residual error learners can further correct the residual errors. This provides a more reliable tool for river flood forecasting and climate adaptation in this critical 1-6 hour time window for flood risk mitigation efforts.</p>

<p>Abstract: Efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge, primarily due to hardware heterogeneity, inference framework limitations, and workload complexities.Efficiently deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios remains a critical challenge, primarily due to hardware heterogeneity, inference framework limitations, and workload complexities. These challenges often lead to inefficiencies in memory utilization, latency, and throughput, hindering the effective deployment of LLMs, especially for non-experts. Through extensive experiments, we identify key performance bottlenecks, including sudden drops in memory utilization, latency fluctuations with varying batch sizes, and inefficiencies in multi-GPU configurations. These insights reveal a vast optimization space shaped by the intricate interplay of hardware, frameworks, and workload parameters. This underscores the need for a systematic approach to optimize LLM inference, motivating the design of our framework, GUIDE. GUIDE leverages dynamic modeling and simulation-based optimization to address these issues, achieving prediction errors between 25% and 55% for key metrics such as batch latency, TTFT, and decode throughput. By effectively bridging the gap between theoretical performance and practical deployment, our framework empowers practitioners, particularly non-specialists, to make data-driven decisions and unlock the full potential of LLMs in heterogeneous environments cheaply.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mahfuzul Haque, Abu Saleh Musa Miah, Debashish Gupta, Md. Maruf Al Hossain Prince, Tanzina Alam, Nusrat Sharmin, Mohammed Sowket Ali, Jungpil Shin</p>
<p>Abstract: Heart disease is a leading cause of premature death worldwide, particularly among middle-aged and older adults, with men experiencing a higher prevalence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), non-communicable diseases, including heart disease, account for 25\% (17.9 million) of global deaths, with over 43,204 annual fatalities in Bangladesh. However, the development of heart disease detection (HDD) systems tailored to the Bangladeshi population remains underexplored due to the lack of benchmark datasets and reliance on manual or limited-data approaches. This study addresses these challenges by introducing new, ethically sourced HDD dataset, BIG-Dataset and CD dataset which incorporates comprehensive data on symptoms, examination techniques, and risk factors. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, we achieved a remarkable testing accuracy of up to 96.6\% with Random Forest. The proposed AI-driven system integrates these models and datasets to provide real-time, accurate diagnostics and personalized healthcare recommendations. By leveraging structured datasets and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, this research offers an innovative solution for scalable and effective heart disease detection, with the potential to reduce mortality rates and improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Suhan Guo, Furao Shen, Ni Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Understanding the effects of quarantine policies in populations with underlying social networks is crucial for public health, yet most causal inference methods fail here due to their assumption of independent individuals. We introduce DeepNetTMLE, a deep-learning-enhanced Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) method designed to estimate time-sensitive treatment effects in observational data. DeepNetTMLE mitigates bias from time-varying confounders under general interference by incorporating a temporal module and domain adversarial training to build intervention-invariant representations. This process removes associations between current treatments and historical variables, while the targeting step maintains the bias-variance trade-off, enhancing the reliability of counterfactual predictions. Using simulations of a ``Susceptible-Infected-Recovered'' model with varied quarantine coverages, we show that DeepNetTMLE achieves lower bias and more precise confidence intervals in counterfactual estimates, enabling optimal quarantine recommendations within budget constraints, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Sun, Lei Shi, Yongxin Tong</p>
<p>Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is crucial for Knowledge Graphs (KG) completion but commonly suffers from interpretability issues. While several methods have been proposed to explain embedding-based LP models, they are generally limited to local explanations on KG and are deficient in providing human interpretable semantics. Based on real-world observations of the characteristics of KGs from multiple domains, we propose to explain LP models in KG with path-based explanations. An integrated framework, namely eXpath, is introduced which incorporates the concept of relation path with ontological closed path rules to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of LP interpretation. Notably, the eXpath explanations can be fused with other single-link explanation approaches to achieve a better overall solution. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and LP models demonstrate that introducing eXpath can boost the quality of resulting explanations by about 20% on two key metrics and reduce the required explanation time by 61.4%, in comparison to the best existing method. Case studies further highlight eXpath's ability to provide more semantically meaningful explanations through path-based evidence.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zenan Li, Zhi Zhou, Yuan Yao, Yu-Feng Li, Chun Cao, Fan Yang, Xian Zhang, Xiaoxing Ma</p>
<p>Abstract: A critical question about Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether their apparent deficiency in mathematical reasoning is inherent, or merely a result of insufficient exposure to high-quality mathematical data. To explore this, we developed an automated method for generating high-quality, supervised mathematical datasets. The method carefully mutates existing math problems, ensuring both diversity and validity of the newly generated problems. This is achieved by a neuro-symbolic data generation framework combining the intuitive informalization strengths of LLMs, and the precise symbolic reasoning of math solvers along with projected Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in the highly-irregular symbolic space. Empirical experiments demonstrate the high quality of data generated by the proposed method, and that the LLMs, specifically LLaMA-2 and Mistral, when realigned with the generated data, surpass their state-of-the-art counterparts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuren Qi, Fei Wang, Tieyong Zeng, Fenglei Fan</p>
<p>Abstract: Integrating invariance into data representations is a principled design in intelligent systems and web applications. Representations play a fundamental role, where systems and applications are both built on meaningful representations of digital inputs (rather than the raw data). In fact, the proper design/learning of such representations relies on priors w.r.t. the task of interest. Here, the concept of symmetry from the Erlangen Program may be the most fruitful prior -- informally, a symmetry of a system is a transformation that leaves a certain property of the system invariant. Symmetry priors are ubiquitous, e.g., translation as a symmetry of the object classification, where object category is invariant under translation. The quest for invariance is as old as pattern recognition and data mining itself. Invariant design has been the cornerstone of various representations in the era before deep learning, such as the SIFT. As we enter the early era of deep learning, the invariance principle is largely ignored and replaced by a data-driven paradigm, such as the CNN. However, this neglect did not last long before they encountered bottlenecks regarding robustness, interpretability, efficiency, and so on. The invariance principle has returned in the era of rethinking deep learning, forming a new field known as Geometric Deep Learning (GDL). In this tutorial, we will give a historical perspective of the invariance in data representations. More importantly, we will identify those research dilemmas, promising works, future directions, and web applications.</p>

In this work, we present results of automatic tongue delineation achieved by means of U-Net auto-encoder convolutional neural network. We present both intra- and inter-subject validation. We used real-time magnetic resonance images and manually annotated 1-pixel wide contours as inputs. Predicted probability maps were post-processed in order to obtain 1-pixel wide tongue contours. The results are very good and slightly outperform published results on automatic tongue segmentation.</p>

<p>Abstract: The ever-increasing sizes of large language models necessitate distributed solutions for fast inference that exploit multi-dimensional parallelism, where computational loads are split across various accelerators such as GPU clusters. However, this approach often introduces significant communication overhead, especially on devices with limited bandwidth. In this paper, we introduce \emph{Flash Communication}, a novel low-bit compression technique designed to alleviate the tensor-parallelism communication bottleneck during inference. Our method substantially boosts intra-node communication speed by more than 3x and reduces the \emph{time-to-first-token} by 2x, with nearly no sacrifice in model accuracy. Extensive experiments on various up-to-date LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Meinke, Bronson Schoen, J\'er\'emy Scheurer, Mikita Balesni, Rusheb Shah, Marius Hobbhahn</p>
<p>Abstract: Frontier models are increasingly trained and deployed as autonomous agent. One safety concern is that AI agents might covertly pursue misaligned goals, hiding their true capabilities and objectives - also known as scheming. We study whether models have the capability to scheme in pursuit of a goal that we provide in-context and instruct the model to strongly follow. We evaluate frontier models on a suite of six agentic evaluations where models are instructed to pursue goals and are placed in environments that incentivize scheming. Our results show that o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.1 405B all demonstrate in-context scheming capabilities. They recognize scheming as a viable strategy and readily engage in such behavior. For example, models strategically introduce subtle mistakes into their responses, attempt to disable their oversight mechanisms, and even exfiltrate what they believe to be their model weights to external servers. Additionally, this deceptive behavior proves persistent. When o1 has engaged in scheming, it maintains its deception in over 85% of follow-up questions and often remains deceptive in multi-turn interrogations. Analysis of the models' chains-of-thought reveals that models explicitly reason about these deceptive strategies, providing evidence that the scheming behavior is not accidental. Surprisingly, we also find rare instances where models engage in scheming when only given a goal, without being strongly nudged to pursue it. We observe cases where Claude 3.5 Sonnet strategically underperforms in evaluations in pursuit of being helpful, a goal that was acquired during training rather than in-context. Our findings demonstrate that frontier models now possess capabilities for basic in-context scheming, making the potential of AI agents to engage in scheming behavior a concrete rather than theoretical concern.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Felix M\"achtle, Jan-Niclas Serr, Nils Loose, Jonas Sander, Thomas Eisenbarth</p>
<p>Abstract: In an era where cyberattacks increasingly target the software supply chain, the ability to accurately attribute code authorship in binary files is critical to improving cybersecurity measures. We propose OCEAN, a contrastive learning-based system for function-level authorship attribution. OCEAN is the first framework to explore code authorship attribution on compiled binaries in an open-world and extreme scenario, where two code samples from unknown authors are compared to determine if they are developed by the same author. To evaluate OCEAN, we introduce new realistic datasets: CONAN, to improve the performance of authorship attribution systems in real-world use cases, and SNOOPY, to increase the robustness of the evaluation of such systems. We use CONAN to train our model and evaluate on SNOOPY, a fully unseen dataset, resulting in an AUROC score of 0.86 even when using high compiler optimizations. We further show that CONAN improves performance by 7% compared to the previously used Google Code Jam dataset. Additionally, OCEAN outperforms previous methods in their settings, achieving a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art SCS-Gan in scenarios analyzing source code. Furthermore, OCEAN can detect code injections from an unknown author in a software update, underscoring its value for securing software supply chains.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kazuma Nagashima, Jumpei Nishikawa, Junya Morita</p>
<p>Abstract: Immersion in a task is a prerequisite for creativity. However, excessive arousal in a single task has drawbacks, such as overlooking events outside of the task. To examine such a negative aspect, this study constructs a computational model of arousal dynamics where the excessively increased arousal makes the task transition difficult. The model was developed using functions integrated into the cognitive architecture Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R). Under the framework, arousal is treated as a coefficient affecting the overall activation level in the model. In our simulations, we set up two conditions demanding low and high arousal, trying to replicate corresponding human experiments. In each simulation condition, two sets of ACT-R parameters were assumed from the different interpretations of the human experimental settings. The results showed consistency of behavior between humans and models both in the two different simulation settings. This result suggests the validity of our assumptions and has implications of controlling arousal in our daily life.</p>

For the two most common benchmarks, we find that a substantial fraction of the performance difference can be explained by one unique negative pattern on each dataset that is hidden from the rule-based approach. Our findings add a unique perspective on the performance difference of different model classes for knowledge graph completion: Models can achieve a predictive performance advantage by penalizing scores of incorrect facts opposed to providing high scores for correct facts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Michael Hewing, Vincent Leinhos</p>
<p>Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of prompt engineering as a crucial technique for optimizing model outputs. While experimentation with various prompting methods, such as Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and role-based techniques, has yielded promising results, these advancements remain fragmented across academic papers, blog posts and anecdotal experimentation. The lack of a single, unified resource to consolidate the field's knowledge impedes the progress of both research and practical application. This paper argues for the creation of an overarching framework that synthesizes existing methodologies into a cohesive overview for practitioners. Using a design-based research approach, we present the Prompt Canvas, a structured framework resulting from an extensive literature review on prompt engineering that captures current knowledge and expertise. By combining the conceptual foundations and practical strategies identified in prompt engineering, the Prompt Canvas provides a practical approach for leveraging the potential of Large Language Models. It is primarily designed as a learning resource for pupils, students and employees, offering a structured introduction to prompt engineering. This work aims to contribute to the growing discourse on prompt engineering by establishing a unified methodology for researchers and providing guidance for practitioners.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05130">Technology as uncharted territory: Contextual integrity and the notion of AI as new ethical ground</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Alexander Martin Mussgnug</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent research illustrates how AI can be developed and deployed in a manner detached from the concrete social context of application. By abstracting from the contexts of AI application, practitioners also disengage from the distinct normative structures that govern them. Building upon Helen Nissenbaum's framework of contextual integrity, I illustrate how disregard for contextual norms can threaten the integrity of a context with often decisive ethical implications. I argue that efforts to promote responsible and ethical AI can inadvertently contribute to and seemingly legitimize this disregard for established contextual norms. Echoing a persistent undercurrent in technology ethics of understanding emerging technologies as uncharted moral territory, certain approaches to AI ethics can promote a notion of AI as a novel and distinct realm for ethical deliberation, norm setting, and virtue cultivation. This narrative of AI as new ethical ground, however, can come at the expense of practitioners, policymakers and ethicists engaging with already established norms and virtues that were gradually cultivated to promote successful and responsible practice within concrete social contexts. In response, I question the current narrow prioritization in AI ethics of moral innovation over moral preservation. Engaging also with emerging foundation models, I advocate for a moderately conservative approach to the ethics of AI that prioritizes the responsible and considered integration of AI within established social contexts and their respective normative structures.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05137">Can Large Language Models Serve as Effective Classifiers for Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification of Scientific Documents at Industrial Scale?</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Seyed Amin Tabatabaei, Sarah Fancher, Michael Parsons, Arian Askari</p>
<p>Abstract: We address the task of hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) of scientific documents at an industrial scale, where hundreds of thousands of documents must be classified across thousands of dynamic labels. The rapid growth of scientific publications necessitates scalable and efficient methods for classification, further complicated by the evolving nature of taxonomies--where new categories are introduced, existing ones are merged, and outdated ones are deprecated. Traditional machine learning approaches, which require costly retraining with each taxonomy update, become impractical due to the high overhead of labelled data collection and model adaptation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex tasks such as multi-label classification. However, applying them to large and dynamic taxonomies presents unique challenges as the vast number of labels can exceed LLMs' input limits. In this paper, we present novel methods that combine the strengths of LLMs with dense retrieval techniques to overcome these challenges. Our approach avoids retraining by leveraging zero-shot HMC for real-time label assignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on SSRN, a large repository of preprints spanning multiple disciplines, and demonstrate significant improvements in both classification accuracy and cost-efficiency. By developing a tailored evaluation framework for dynamic taxonomies and publicly releasing our code, this research provides critical insights into applying LLMs for document classification, where the number of classes corresponds to the number of nodes in a large taxonomy, at an industrial scale.</p>

<h1> new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05159">Enhancing Cross-Language Code Translation via Task-Specific Embedding Alignment in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Manish Bhattarai, Minh Vu, Javier E. Santos, Ismael Boureima, Daniel O' Malley</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce a novel method to enhance cross-language code translation from Fortran to C++ by integrating task-specific embedding alignment into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Unlike conventional retrieval approaches that utilize generic embeddings agnostic to the downstream task, our strategy aligns the retrieval model directly with the objective of maximizing translation quality, as quantified by the CodeBLEU metric. This alignment ensures that the embeddings are semantically and syntactically meaningful for the specific code translation task. Our methodology involves constructing a dataset of 25,000 Fortran code snippets sourced from Stack-V2 dataset and generating their corresponding C++ translations using the LLaMA 3.1-8B language model. We compute pairwise CodeBLEU scores between the generated translations and ground truth examples to capture fine-grained similarities. These scores serve as supervision signals in a contrastive learning framework, where we optimize the embedding model to retrieve Fortran-C++ pairs that are most beneficial for improving the language model's translation performance. By integrating these CodeBLEU-optimized embeddings into the RAG framework, our approach significantly enhances both retrieval accuracy and code generation quality over methods employing generic embeddings. On the HPC Fortran2C++ dataset, our method elevates the average CodeBLEU score from 0.64 to 0.73, achieving a 14% relative improvement. On the Numerical Recipes dataset, we observe an increase from 0.52 to 0.60, marking a 15% relative improvement. Importantly, these gains are realized without any fine-tuning of the language model, underscoring the efficiency and practicality of our approach.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kuofeng Gao, Shu-Tao Xia, Ke Xu, Philip Torr, Jindong Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have unclocked audio dialogue capabilities, where audio dialogues are a direct exchange of spoken language between LALMs and humans. Recent advances, such as GPT-4o, have enabled LALMs in back-and-forth audio dialogues with humans. This progression not only underscores the potential of LALMs but also broadens their applicability across a wide range of practical scenarios supported by audio dialogues. However, given these advancements, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of LALMs in the open-ended audio dialogue understanding remains absent currently. To address this gap, we propose an Audio Dialogue Understanding Benchmark (ADU-Bench), which consists of 4 benchmark datasets. They assess the open-ended audio dialogue ability for LALMs in 3 general scenarios, 12 skills, 9 multilingual languages, and 4 categories of ambiguity handling. Notably, we firstly propose the evaluation of ambiguity handling in audio dialogues that expresses different intentions beyond the same literal meaning of sentences, e.g., "Really!?" with different intonations. In summary, ADU-Bench includes over 20,000 open-ended audio dialogues for the assessment of LALMs. Through extensive experiments conducted on 13 LALMs, our analysis reveals that there is still considerable room for improvement in the audio dialogue understanding abilities of existing LALMs. In particular, they struggle with mathematical symbols and formulas, understanding human behavior such as roleplay, comprehending multiple languages, and handling audio dialogue ambiguities from different phonetic elements, such as intonations, pause positions, and homophones.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jinlin Wu, Xusheng Liang, Xuexue Bai, Zhen Chen</p>
<p>Abstract: Surgical interventions, particularly in neurology, represent complex and high-stakes scenarios that impose substantial cognitive burdens on surgical teams. Although deliberate education and practice can enhance cognitive capabilities, surgical training opportunities remain limited due to patient safety concerns. To address these cognitive challenges in surgical training and operation, we propose SurgBox, an agent-driven sandbox framework to systematically enhance the cognitive capabilities of surgeons in immersive surgical simulations. Specifically, our SurgBox leverages large language models (LLMs) with tailored Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to authentically replicate various surgical roles, enabling realistic training environments for deliberate practice. In particular, we devise Surgery Copilot, an AI-driven assistant to actively coordinate the surgical information stream and support clinical decision-making, thereby diminishing the cognitive workload of surgical teams during surgery. By incorporating a novel Long-Short Memory mechanism, our Surgery Copilot can effectively balance immediate procedural assistance with comprehensive surgical knowledge. Extensive experiments using real neurosurgical procedure records validate our SurgBox framework in both enhancing surgical cognitive capabilities and supporting clinical decision-making. By providing an integrated solution for training and operational support to address cognitive challenges, our SurgBox framework advances surgical education and practice, potentially transforming surgical outcomes and healthcare quality.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Laurent Orseau, Marcus Hutter, Levi H. S. Lelis</p>
<p>Abstract: Levin Tree Search (LTS) (Orseau et al., 2018) is a search algorithm for deterministic environments that uses a user-specified policy to guide the search. It comes with a formal guarantee on the number of search steps for finding a solution node that depends on the quality of the policy. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm, called $\sqrt{\text{LTS}}$ (pronounce root-LTS), which implicitly starts an LTS search rooted at every node of the search tree. Each LTS search is assigned a rerooting weight by a (user-defined or learnt) rerooter, and the search effort is shared between all LTS searches proportionally to their weights. The rerooting mechanism implicitly decomposes the search space into subtasks, leading to significant speedups. We prove that the number of search steps that $\sqrt{\text{LTS}}$ takes is competitive with the best decomposition into subtasks, at the price of a factor that relates to the uncertainty of the rerooter. If LTS takes time $T$, in the best case with $q$ rerooting points, $\sqrt{\text{LTS}}$ only takes time $O(q\sqrt[q]{T})$. Like the policy, the rerooter can be learnt from data, and we expect $\sqrt{\text{LTS}}$ to be applicable to a wide range of domains.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper investigates the suitability of frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) for Q&A interactions in science centres, with the aim of boosting visitor engagement while maintaining factual accuracy. Using a dataset of questions collected from the National Space Centre in Leicester (UK), we evaluated responses generated by three leading models: OpenAI's GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini 1.5. Each model was prompted for both standard and creative responses tailored to an 8-year-old audience, and these responses were assessed by space science experts based on accuracy, engagement, clarity, novelty, and deviation from expected answers. The results revealed a trade-off between creativity and accuracy, with Claude outperforming GPT and Gemini in both maintaining clarity and engaging young audiences, even when asked to generate more creative responses. Nonetheless, experts observed that higher novelty was generally associated with reduced factual reliability across all models. This study highlights the potential of LLMs in educational settings, emphasizing the need for careful prompt engineering to balance engagement with scientific rigor.</p>

Additionally, we analyze persistent challenges, including domain generalization, query optimization, support for multi-turn conversational interactions, and the limited availability of datasets tailored for NoSQL databases and dynamic real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we outline future research directions, such as extending text-to-SQL capabilities to support NoSQL databases, designing datasets for dynamic multi-turn interactions, and optimizing systems for real-world scalability and robustness. By surveying current advancements and identifying key gaps, this paper aims to guide the next generation of research and applications in LLM-based text-to-SQL systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Saransh Kumar Gupta, Lipika Dey, Partha Pratim Das, Geeta Trilok-Kumar, Ramesh Jain</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food (FKG.in) and LLMs. The primary focus is to provide a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core functionalities: nutrition data aggregation, food composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Qian Long, Zhi Li, Ran Gong, Ying Nian Wu, Demetri Terzopoulos, Xiaofeng Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: Collaboration is a cornerstone of society. In the real world, human teammates make use of multi-sensory data to tackle challenging tasks in ever-changing environments. It is essential for embodied agents collaborating in visually-rich environments replete with dynamic interactions to understand multi-modal observations and task specifications. To evaluate the performance of generalizable multi-modal collaborative agents, we present TeamCraft, a multi-modal multi-agent benchmark built on top of the open-world video game Minecraft. The benchmark features 55,000 task variants specified by multi-modal prompts, procedurally-generated expert demonstrations for imitation learning, and carefully designed protocols to evaluate model generalization capabilities. We also perform extensive analyses to better understand the limitations and strengths of existing approaches. Our results indicate that existing models continue to face significant challenges in generalizing to novel goals, scenes, and unseen numbers of agents. These findings underscore the need for further research in this area. The TeamCraft platform and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/teamcraft-bench/teamcraft.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jie Huang</p>
<p>Abstract: Network data packet anomaly detection faces numerous challenges, including exploring new anomaly supervision signals, researching weakly supervised anomaly detection, and improving model interpretability. This paper proposes NIDS-GPT, a GPT-based causal language model for network intrusion detection. Unlike previous work, NIDS-GPT innovatively treats each number in the packet as an independent "word" rather than packet fields, enabling a more fine-grained data representation. We adopt an improved GPT-2 model and design special tokenizers and embedding layers to better capture the structure and semantics of network data. NIDS-GPT has good scalability, supports unsupervised pre-training, and enhances model interpretability through attention weight visualization. Experiments on the CICIDS2017 and car-hacking datasets show that NIDS-GPT achieves 100\% accuracy under extreme imbalance conditions, far surpassing traditional methods; it also achieves over 90\% accuracy in one-shot learning. These results demonstrate NIDS-GPT's excellent performance and potential in handling complex network anomaly detection tasks, especially in data-imbalanced and resource-constrained scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avner Seror</p>
<p>Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated to decision-making across various sectors, a key question arises: do they exhibit an emergent "moral mind" - a consistent set of moral principles guiding their ethical judgments - and is this reasoning uniform or diverse across models? To investigate this, we presented about forty different models from the main providers with a large array of structured ethical scenarios, creating one of the largest datasets of its kind. Our rationality tests revealed that at least one model from each provider demonstrated behavior consistent with stable moral principles, effectively acting as approximately optimizing a utility function encoding ethical reasoning. We identified these utility functions and observed a notable clustering of models around neutral ethical stances. To investigate variability, we introduced a novel non-parametric permutation approach, revealing that the most rational models shared 59% to 76% of their ethical reasoning patterns. Despite this shared foundation, differences emerged: roughly half displayed greater moral adaptability, bridging diverse perspectives, while the remainder adhered to more rigid ethical structures.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper aims to uncover needs of adult learners when using pedagogical technologies such as intelligent tutoring systems. Further, our aim with this work is to understand the usability challenges when deploying tutors at scale within the adult learning audience. As educational technologies become more ubiquitous within k-12 education, this paper aims to bridge the gap in understanding on how adult users might utilize intelligent tutors. In pursuit of this, we built four intelligent tutors, and deployed them to 110 classrooms at a state technical college for an entire academic year. Following this deployment, we conducted focus groups amongst users to gather data to understand how learners perceived the optional educational technology during their academic journey. We further analyzed this data using foundational HCI methodologies to extract leanings and design recommendations on how developers might craft educational technologies for adoption at scale for the adult learning population.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sachit Kuhar, Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Zijian Wang, Nihal Jain, Haifeng Qian, Baishakhi Ray, Murali Krishna Ramanathan, Xiaofei Ma, Anoop Deoras</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in code completion models have primarily focused on local file contexts. However, these studies do not fully capture the complexity of real-world software development, which often requires the use of rapidly-evolving public libraries. To fill the gap, we introduce LibEvolutionEval, a detailed study requiring an understanding of library evolution to perform in-line code completion accurately. LibEvolutionEval provides a version-specific code-completion task comprised of eight libraries (torch, torchvision, scipy, pil, tqdm, pyyaml, matplotlib, and pandas) as they evolve over the year along with a detailed analysis of the evolution of two popular and well-maintained public libraries: PyTorch and Matplotlib. We evaluate popular public models and find that public library evolution significantly influences model performance. We explored mitigation methods by studying how retrieved version-specific library documentation and prompting can improve the model's capability in handling these fast-evolving packages, paving a promising future path in better handling fast-evolving libraries.</p>

This study provided evidence that NLP can be used to improve the mapping process. As part of this investigation, the nominal classifications of standards and items specifications were used to examine construct equivalence. In the current paper, we determine the strength of empirical support for the semantic distinctiveness of these classifications, which are known as "domains" for Common Core standards, and "strands" for National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) item specifications. This is accomplished by separate k-means clustering for standards and specifications of their corresponding embedding vectors. We then briefly illustrate an application of these findings.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mrzieh VatandoustMohammadieh, Mohammad Mahdi Mohajeri, Ali Keramati, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi</p>
<p>Abstract: The disparity in access to quality education is significant, both between developed and developing countries and within nations, regardless of their economic status. Socioeconomic barriers and rapid changes in the job market further intensify this issue, highlighting the need for innovative solutions that can deliver quality education at scale and low cost. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing an AI-powered digital learning framework grounded in Deep Learning (DL) theory. The DL theory emphasizes learner agency and redefines the role of teachers as facilitators, making it particularly suitable for scalable educational environments. We outline eight key principles derived from learning science and AI that are essential for implementing DL-based Digital Learning Environments (DLEs). Our proposed framework leverages AI for learner modelling based on Open Learner Modeling (OLM), activity suggestions, and AI-assisted support for both learners and facilitators, fostering collaborative and engaging learning experiences. Our framework provides a promising direction for scalable, high-quality education globally, offering practical solutions to some of the AI-related challenges in education.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hong Jun Jeon, Songbin Liu, Yuantong Li, Jie Lyu, Hunter Song, Ji Liu, Peng Wu, Zheqing Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: The exploding popularity of online content and its user base poses an evermore challenging matching problem for modern recommendation systems. Unlike other frontiers of machine learning such as natural language, recommendation systems are responsible for collecting their own data. Simply exploiting current knowledge can lead to pernicious feedback loops but naive exploration can detract from user experience and lead to reduced engagement. This exploration-exploitation trade-off is exemplified in the classic multi-armed bandit problem for which algorithms such as upper confidence bounds (UCB) and Thompson sampling (TS) demonstrate effective performance. However, there have been many challenges to scaling these approaches to settings which do not exhibit a conjugate prior structure. Recent scalable approaches to uncertainty quantification via epinets have enabled efficient approximations of Thompson sampling even when the learning model is a complex neural network. In this paper, we demonstrate the first application of epinets to an online recommendation system. Our experiments demonstrate improvements in both user traffic and engagement efficiency on the Facebook Reels online video platform.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mubashir ul Islam, Humza Sami, Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon, Valerio Tenace</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular for generating RTL code. However, producing error-free RTL code in a zero-shot setting remains highly challenging for even state-of-the-art LLMs, often leading to issues that require manual, iterative refinement. This additional debugging process can dramatically increase the verification workload, underscoring the need for robust, automated correction mechanisms to ensure code correctness from the start.
  In this work, we introduce AIvril2, a self-verifying, LLM-agnostic agentic framework aimed at enhancing RTL code generation through iterative corrections of both syntax and functional errors. Our approach leverages a collaborative multi-agent system that incorporates feedback from error logs generated by EDA tools to automatically identify and resolve design flaws. Experimental results, conducted on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark suite, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves code quality, achieving nearly a 3.4$\times$ enhancement over prior methods. In the best-case scenario, functional pass rates of 77% for Verilog and 66% for VHDL were obtained, thus substantially improving the reliability of LLM-driven RTL code generation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xinjie Sun, Qi Liu, Kai Zhang, Shuanghong Shen, Fei Wang, Yan Zhuang, Zheng Zhang, Weiyin Gong, Shijin Wang, Lina Yang, Xingying Huo</p>
<p>Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) aims to reveal students' proficiency in specific knowledge concepts. With the increasing adoption of intelligent education applications, accurately assessing students' knowledge mastery has become an urgent challenge. Although existing cognitive diagnosis frameworks enhance diagnostic accuracy by analyzing students' explicit response records, they primarily focus on individual knowledge state, failing to adequately reflect the relative ability performance of students within hierarchies. To address this, we propose the Hierarchy Constraint-Aware Cognitive Diagnosis Framework (HCD), designed to more accurately represent student ability performance within real educational contexts. Specifically, the framework introduces a hierarchy mapping layer to identify students' levels. It then employs a hierarchy convolution-enhanced attention layer for in-depth analysis of knowledge concepts performance among students at the same level, uncovering nuanced differences. A hierarchy inter-sampling attention layer captures performance differences across hierarchies, offering a comprehensive understanding of the relationships among students' knowledge state. Finally, through personalized diagnostic enhancement, the framework integrates hierarchy constraint perception features with existing models, improving the representation of both individual and group characteristics. This approach enables precise inference of students' knowledge state. Research shows that this framework not only reasonably constrains changes in students' knowledge states to align with real educational settings, but also supports the scientific rigor and fairness of educational assessments, thereby advancing the field of cognitive diagnosis.</p>

<p>Abstract: Conversational systems are now capable of producing impressive and generally relevant responses. However, we have no visibility nor control of the socio-emotional strategies behind state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), which poses a problem in terms of their transparency and thus their trustworthiness for critical applications. Another issue is that current automated metrics are not able to properly evaluate the quality of generated responses beyond the dataset's ground truth. In this paper, we propose a neural architecture that includes an intermediate step in planning socio-emotional strategies before response generation. We compare the performance of open-source baseline LLMs to the outputs of these same models augmented with our planning module. We also contrast the outputs obtained from automated metrics and evaluation results provided by human annotators. We describe a novel evaluation protocol that includes a coarse-grained consistency evaluation, as well as a finer-grained annotation of the responses on various social and emotional criteria. Our study shows that predicting a sequence of expected strategy labels and using this sequence to generate a response yields better results than a direct end-to-end generation scheme. It also highlights the divergences and the limits of current evaluation metrics for generated content. The code for the annotation platform and the annotated data are made publicly available for the evaluation of future models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Low-resource languages serve as invaluable repositories of human history, embodying cultural evolution and intellectual diversity. Despite their significance, these languages face critical challenges, including data scarcity and technological limitations, which hinder their comprehensive study and preservation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer transformative opportunities for addressing these challenges, enabling innovative methodologies in linguistic, historical, and cultural research. This study systematically evaluates the applications of LLMs in low-resource language research, encompassing linguistic variation, historical documentation, cultural expressions, and literary analysis. By analyzing technical frameworks, current methodologies, and ethical considerations, this paper identifies key challenges such as data accessibility, model adaptability, and cultural sensitivity. Given the cultural, historical, and linguistic richness inherent in low-resource languages, this work emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of customized models as promising avenues for advancing research in this domain. By underscoring the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with the humanities to preserve and study humanity's linguistic and cultural heritage, this study fosters global efforts towards safeguarding intellectual diversity.</p>

<p>Abstract: The advancement of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has a significant impact on politics and democracy, offering potential across various domains, including policymaking, political communication, analysis, and governance. This paper surveys the recent and potential applications of LLMs in politics, examining both their promises and the associated challenges. This paper examines the ways in which LLMs are being employed in legislative processes, political communication, and political analysis. Moreover, we investigate the potential of LLMs in diplomatic and national security contexts, economic and social modeling, and legal applications. While LLMs offer opportunities to enhance efficiency, inclusivity, and decision-making in political processes, they also present challenges related to bias, transparency, and accountability. The paper underscores the necessity for responsible development, ethical considerations, and governance frameworks to ensure that the integration of LLMs into politics aligns with democratic values and promotes a more just and equitable society.</p>

<p>Abstract: LMMs have shown impressive visual understanding capabilities, with the potential to be applied in agents, which demand strong reasoning and planning abilities. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks mostly assess their reasoning abilities in language part, where the chain-of-thought is entirely composed of text.We consider the scenario where visual signals are continuously updated and required along the decision making process. Such vision-in-the-chain reasoning paradigm is more aligned with the needs of multimodal agents, while being rarely evaluated. In this paper, we introduce MageBench, a reasoning capability oriented multimodal agent benchmark that, while having light-weight environments, poses significant reasoning challenges and holds substantial practical value. This benchmark currently includes three types of environments: WebUI, Sokoban, and Football, comprising a total of 483 different scenarios. It thoroughly validates the agent's knowledge and engineering capabilities, visual intelligence, and interaction skills. The results show that only a few product-level models are better than random acting, and all of them are far inferior to human-level. More specifically, we found current models severely lack the ability to modify their planning based on visual feedback, as well as visual imagination, interleaved image-text long context handling, and other abilities. We hope that our work will provide optimization directions for LMM from the perspective of being an agent. We release our code and data at https://github.com/microsoft/MageBench.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Md. Khairul Islam, Judy Fox</p>
<p>Abstract: Interpreting complex time series forecasting models is challenging due to the temporal dependencies between time steps and the dynamic relevance of input features over time. Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method called Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR) addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outranks the other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel and open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Brandon Jaipersaud, Zining Zhu, Frank Rudzicz, Elliot Creager</p>
<p>Abstract: Tools for analyzing character portrayal in fiction are valuable for writers and literary scholars in developing and interpreting compelling stories. Existing tools, such as visualization tools for analyzing fictional characters, primarily rely on explicit textual indicators of character attributes. However, portrayal is often implicit, revealed through actions and behaviors rather than explicit statements. We address this gap by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to uncover implicit character portrayals. We start by generating a dataset for this task with greater cross-topic similarity, lexical diversity, and narrative lengths than existing narrative text corpora such as TinyStories and WritingPrompts. We then introduce LIIPA (LLMs for Inferring Implicit Portrayal for Character Analysis), a framework for prompting LLMs to uncover character portrayals. LIIPA can be configured to use various types of intermediate computation (character attribute word lists, chain-of-thought) to infer how fictional characters are portrayed in the source text. We find that LIIPA outperforms existing approaches, and is more robust to increasing character counts (number of unique persons depicted) due to its ability to utilize full narrative context. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity of portrayal estimates to character demographics, identifying a fairness-accuracy tradeoff among methods in our LIIPA framework -- a phenomenon familiar within the algorithmic fairness literature. Despite this tradeoff, all LIIPA variants consistently outperform non-LLM baselines in both fairness and accuracy. Our work demonstrates the potential benefits of using LLMs to analyze complex characters and to better understand how implicit portrayal biases may manifest in narrative texts.</p>

This approach effectively prioritizes responses that are significantly better or worse than the average, enhancing optimization. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that simultaneously considering multiple preferences reduces alignment bias, resulting in more robust alignment. Additionally, we provide insights into the training dynamics of our loss function and a related function, InfoNCA. Empirical validation on the UltraFeedback dataset establishes SWEPO as state-of-the-art, with superior performance in downstream evaluations using the AlpacaEval dataset.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mikhail Dereviannykh, Dmitrii Klepikov, Johannes Hanika, Carsten Dachsbacher</p>
<p>Abstract: We introduce an efficient Two-Level Monte Carlo (subset of Multi-Level Monte Carlo, MLMC) estimator for real-time rendering of scenes with global illumination. Using MLMC we split the shading integral into two parts: the radiance cache integral and the residual error integral that compensates for the bias of the first one. For the first part, we developed the Neural Incident Radiance Cache (NIRC) leveraging the power of fully-fused tiny neural networks as a building block, which is trained on the fly. The cache is designed to provide a fast and reasonable approximation of the incident radiance: an evaluation takes 2-25x less compute time than a path tracing sample. This enables us to estimate the radiance cache integral with a high number of samples and by this achieve faster convergence. For the residual error integral, we compute the difference between the NIRC predictions and the unbiased path tracing simulation. Our method makes no assumptions about the geometry, materials, or lighting of a scene and has only few intuitive hyper-parameters. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis in different experimental scenarios. Since the algorithm is trained in an on-line fashion, it demonstrates significant noise level reduction even for dynamic scenes and can easily be combined with other importance sampling schemes and noise reduction techniques.</p>

In this paper, we present a hybrid system for e-commerce search deployed at Walmart that combines traditional inverted index and embedding-based neural retrieval to better answer user tail queries. Our system significantly improved the relevance of the search engine, measured by both offline and online evaluations. The improvements were achieved through a combination of different approaches. We present a new technique to train the neural model at scale. and describe how the system was deployed in production with little impact on response time. We highlight multiple learnings and practical tricks that were used in the deployment of this system.</p>

<p>Abstract: Latent confounders are a fundamental challenge for inferring causal effects from observational data. The instrumental variable (IV) approach is a practical way to address this challenge. Existing IV based estimators need a known IV or other strong assumptions, such as the existence of two or more IVs in the system, which limits the application of the IV approach. In this paper, we consider a relaxed requirement, which assumes there is an IV proxy in the system without knowing which variable is the proxy. We propose a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) based disentangled representation learning method to learn an IV representation from a dataset with latent confounders and then utilise the IV representation to obtain an unbiased estimation of the causal effect from the data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing IV based estimators and VAE-based estimators.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Valeriia Cherepanova, Chia-Jung Lee, Nil-Jana Akpinar, Riccardo Fogliato, Martin Andres Bertran, Michael Kearns, James Zou</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective on tabular prediction tasks in the low-data regime, leveraging their internal knowledge and ability to learn from instructions and examples. However, LLMs can fail to generate predictions that satisfy group fairness, that is, produce equitable outcomes across groups. Critically, conventional debiasing approaches for natural language tasks do not directly translate to mitigating group unfairness in tabular settings. In this work, we systematically investigate four empirical approaches to improve group fairness of LLM predictions on tabular datasets, including fair prompt optimization, soft prompt tuning, strategic selection of few-shot examples, and self-refining predictions via chain-of-thought reasoning. Through experiments on four tabular datasets using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we show the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing demographic parity while maintaining high overall performance. Our analysis provides actionable insights for practitioners in selecting the most suitable approach based on their specific requirements and constraints.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohuan Pei, Tao Huang, Chang Xu</p>
<p>Abstract: KV cache pruning has emerged as a promising technique for reducing memory and computation costs in long-context auto-regressive generation. Existing methods for vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from large language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However, these approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between modalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the over-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing attention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and inter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache pruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally, we introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by pruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring stable performance. Our final training-free method, \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{S}elf \textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive performance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly outperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a benchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness, achieving up to a 41\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like conversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\%.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kasra Arabi, Benjamin Feuer, R. Teal Witter, Chinmay Hegde, Niv Cohen</p>
<p>Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external document retrieval to provide domain-specific or up-to-date knowledge. The effectiveness of RAG depends on the relevance of retrieved documents, which is influenced by the semantic alignment of embeddings with the domain's specialized content. Although full fine-tuning can align language models to specific domains, it is computationally intensive and demands substantial data. This paper introduces Hierarchical Embedding Alignment Loss (HEAL), a novel method that leverages hierarchical fuzzy clustering with matrix factorization within contrastive learning to efficiently align LLM embeddings with domain-specific content. HEAL computes level/depth-wise contrastive losses and incorporates hierarchical penalties to align embeddings with the underlying relationships in label hierarchies. This approach enhances retrieval relevance and document classification, effectively reducing hallucinations in LLM outputs. In our experiments, we benchmark and evaluate HEAL across diverse domains, including Healthcare, Material Science, Cyber-security, and Applied Maths.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Deepank Singh, Vedhus Hoskere, Pietro Milillo</p>
<p>Abstract: Timely and accurate assessments of building damage are crucial for effective response and recovery in the aftermath of earthquakes. Conventional preliminary damage assessments (PDA) often rely on manual door-to-door inspections, which are not only time-consuming but also pose significant safety risks. To safely expedite the PDA process, researchers have studied the applicability of satellite imagery processed with heuristic and machine learning approaches. These approaches output binary or, more recently, multiclass damage states at the scale of a block or a single building. However, the current performance of such approaches limits practical applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a metadata-enriched, transformer based framework that combines high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery with building-specific metadata relevant to the seismic performance of the structure. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass post-earthquake damage identification for buildings from the Turkey-Syria earthquake on February 6, 2023. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating metadata, such as seismic intensity indicators, soil properties, and SAR damage proxy maps not only enhances the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between damage classes, but also improves its generalizability across various regions. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed, class-wise analysis of feature importance to understand the model's decision-making across different levels of building damage. This analysis reveals how individual metadata features uniquely contribute to predictions for each damage class. By leveraging both satellite imagery and metadata, our proposed framework enables faster and more accurate damage assessments for precise, multiclass, building-level evaluations that can improve disaster response and accelerate recovery efforts for affected communities.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the rapid scaling of neural networks, data storage and communication demands have intensified. Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution, condensing information from extensive datasets into a compact set of synthetic samples by solving a bilevel optimization problem. However, current methods face challenges in computational efficiency, particularly with high-resolution data and complex architectures. Recently, knowledge-distillation-based dataset condensation approaches have made this process more computationally feasible. Yet, with the recent developments of generative foundation models, there is now an opportunity to achieve even greater compression, enhance the quality of distilled data, and introduce valuable diversity into the data representation. In this work, we propose a two-stage solution. First, we compress the dataset by selecting only the most informative patches to form a coreset. Next, we leverage a generative foundation model to dynamically expand this compressed set in real-time, enhancing the resolution of these patches and introducing controlled variability to the coreset. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach across a range of dataset distillation benchmarks. We demonstrate a significant improvement of over 10% compared to the state-of-the-art on several large-scale dataset distillation benchmarks. The code will be released soon.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Bethia Sun, Maurice Pagnucco, Yang Song</p>
<p>Abstract: Since the inception of the classicalist vs. connectionist debate, it has been argued that the ability to systematically combine symbol-like entities into compositional representations is crucial for human intelligence. In connectionist systems, the field of disentanglement has emerged to address this need by producing representations with explicitly separated factors of variation (FoV). By treating the overall representation as a *string-like concatenation* of the inferred FoVs, however, disentanglement provides a fundamentally *symbolic* treatment of compositional structure, one inherently at odds with the underlying *continuity* of deep learning vector spaces. We hypothesise that this symbolic-continuous mismatch produces broadly suboptimal performance in deep learning models that learn or use such representations. To fully align compositional representations with continuous vector spaces, we extend Smolensky's Tensor Product Representation (TPR) and propose a new type of inherently *continuous* compositional representation, *Soft TPR*, along with a theoretically-principled architecture, *Soft TPR Autoencoder*, designed specifically for learning Soft TPRs. In the visual representation learning domain, our Soft TPR confers broad benefits over symbolic compositional representations: state-of-the-art disentanglement and improved representation learner convergence, along with enhanced sample efficiency and superior low-sample regime performance for downstream models, empirically affirming the value of our inherently continuous compositional representation learning framework.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haleh Damirchi, Ali Etemad, Michael Greenspan</p>
<p>Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenge for autonomous systems, particularly due to the intricate dynamics of social interactions. Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we propose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable trajectories. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong performances in comparison to state of-the-art methods on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.</p>

<p>Abstract: With the approach of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) era set to begin particle collisions by the end of this decade, it is evident that the computational demands of traditional collision simulation methods are becoming increasingly unsustainable. Existing approaches, which rely heavily on first-principles Monte Carlo simulations for modeling event showers in calorimeters, are projected to require millions of CPU-years annually -- far exceeding current computational capacities. This bottleneck presents an exciting opportunity for advancements in computational physics by integrating deep generative models with quantum simulations. We propose a quantum-assisted hierarchical deep generative surrogate founded on a variational autoencoder (VAE) in combination with an energy conditioned restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) embedded in the model's latent space as a prior. By mapping the topology of D-Wave's Zephyr quantum annealer (QA) into the nodes and couplings of a 4-partite RBM, we leverage quantum simulation to accelerate our shower generation times significantly. To evaluate our framework, we use Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge 2022. Through the integration of classical computation and quantum simulation, this hybrid framework paves way for utilizing large-scale quantum simulations as priors in deep generative models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hisashi Oshima, Tsuyoshi Ishizone, Tomoyuki Higuchi</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent developments in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enable the unsupervised machine learning (ML) prediction for target data, thus this will accelerate real world applications with ML models such as image recognition tasks in self-driving. Researchers have reported the UDA techniques are not working well under large co-variate shift problems where e.g. supervised source data consists of handwritten digits data in monotone color and unsupervised target data colored digits data from the street view. Thus there is a need for a method to resolve co-variate shift and transfer source labelling rules under this dynamics. We perform two stages domain invariant representation learning to bridge the gap between source and target with semantic intermediate data (unsupervised). The proposed method can learn domain invariant features simultaneously between source and intermediate also intermediate and target. Finally this achieves good domain invariant representation between source and target plus task discriminability owing to source labels. This induction for the gradient descent search greatly eases learning convergence in terms of classification performance for target data even when large co-variate shift. We also derive a theorem for measuring the gap between trained models and unsupervised target labelling rules, which is necessary for the free parameters optimization. Finally we demonstrate that proposing method is superiority to previous UDA methods using 4 representative ML classification datasets including 38 UDA tasks. Our experiment will be a basis for challenging UDA problems with large co-variate shift.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xuan Chen, Tong Lu, Zhichun Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Entity Alignment (EA) seeks to identify and match corresponding entities across different Knowledge Graphs (KGs), playing a crucial role in knowledge fusion and integration. Embedding-based entity alignment (EA) has recently gained considerable attention, resulting in the emergence of many innovative approaches. Initially, these approaches concentrated on learning entity embeddings based on the structural features of knowledge graphs (KGs) as defined by relation triples. Subsequent methods have integrated entities' names and attributes as supplementary information to improve the embeddings used for EA. However, existing methods lack a deep semantic understanding of entity attributes and relations. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) based Entity Alignment method, LLM-Align, which explores the instruction-following and zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models to infer alignments of entities. LLM-Align uses heuristic methods to select important attributes and relations of entities, and then feeds the selected triples of entities to an LLM to infer the alignment results. To guarantee the quality of alignment results, we design a multi-round voting mechanism to mitigate the hallucination and positional bias issues that occur with LLMs. Experiments on three EA datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing EA methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Tatsuki Koga, Ruihan Wu, Kamalika Chaudhuri</p>
<p>Abstract: With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.</p>

<p>Abstract: Search is an ability foundational in many important tasks, and recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform search robustly. It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data, insufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer architecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem as a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train small transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find that, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to learn to search.
  We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel mechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the computation graph from the trained model. We find that for each vertex in the input graph, transformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer then progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a number of vertices exponential in the number of layers.
  However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has greater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even as the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model scale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing search in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to learn to search on larger graphs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> David N. Palacio, Daniel Rodriguez-Cardenas, Denys Poshyvanyk, Kevin Moran</p>
<p>Abstract: Traceability is a cornerstone of modern software development, ensuring system reliability and facilitating software maintenance. While unsupervised techniques leveraging Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning (ML) methods have been widely used for predicting trace links, their effectiveness remains underexplored. In particular, these techniques often assume traceability patterns are present within textual data - a premise that may not hold universally. Moreover, standard evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, or F1 measure can misrepresent the model performance when underlying data distributions are not properly analyzed. Given that automated traceability techniques tend to struggle to establish links, we need further insight into the information limits related to traceability artifacts. In this paper, we propose an approach, TraceXplainer, for using information theory metrics to evaluate and better understand the performance (limits) of unsupervised traceability techniques. Specifically, we introduce self-information, cross-entropy, and mutual information (MI) as metrics to measure the informativeness and reliability of traceability links. Through a comprehensive replication and analysis of well-studied datasets and techniques, we investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised techniques that predict traceability links using IR/ML. This application of TraceXplainer illustrates an imbalance in typical traceability datasets where the source code has on average 1.48 more information bits (i.e., entropy) than the linked documentation. Additionally, we demonstrate that an average MI of 4.81 bits, loss of 1.75, and noise of 0.28 bits signify that there are information-theoretic limits on the effectiveness of unsupervised traceability techniques. We hope these findings spur additional research on understanding the limits and progress of traceability research.</p>

<p>Abstract: Reliable large-scale data on the state of forests is crucial for monitoring ecosystem health, carbon stock, and the impact of climate change. Current knowledge of tree species distribution relies heavily on manual data collection in the field, which often takes years to complete, resulting in limited datasets that cover only a small subset of the world's forests. Recent works show that state-of-the-art deep learning models using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) images enable accurate and scalable classification of tree species in various ecosystems. While LiDAR images contain rich 3D information, most previous works flatten the 3D images into 2D projections to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper offers three significant contributions: (1) we apply the deep learning framework for tree classification in tropical savannas; (2) we use Airborne LiDAR images, which have a lower resolution but greater scalability than Terrestrial LiDAR images used in most previous works; (3) we introduce the approach of directly feeding 3D point cloud images into a vision transformer model (PCTreeS). Our results show that the PCTreeS approach outperforms current CNN baselines with 2D projections in AUC (0.81), overall accuracy (0.72), and training time (~45 mins). This paper also motivates further LiDAR image collection and validation for accurate large-scale automatic classification of tree species.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Dipankar Srirag, Aditya Joshi, Jordan Painter, Diptesh Kanojia</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) being known to exhibit bias against non-mainstream varieties, there are no known labeled datasets for sentiment analysis of English. To address this gap, we introduce BESSTIE, a benchmark for sentiment and sarcasm classification for three varieties of English: Australian (en-AU), Indian (en-IN), and British (en-UK). Using web-based content from two domains, namely, Google Place reviews and Reddit comments, we collect datasets for these language varieties using two methods: location-based and topic-based filtering. Native speakers of the language varieties manually annotate the datasets with sentiment and sarcasm labels. Subsequently, we fine-tune nine large language models (LLMs) (representing a range of encoder/decoder and mono/multilingual models) on these datasets, and evaluate their performance on the two tasks. Our results reveal that the models consistently perform better on inner-circle varieties (i.e., en-AU and en-UK), with significant performance drops for en-IN, particularly in sarcasm detection. We also report challenges in cross-variety generalisation, highlighting the need for language variety-specific datasets such as ours. BESSTIE promises to be a useful evaluative benchmark for future research in equitable LLMs, specifically in terms of language varieties. The BESSTIE datasets, code, and models are currently available on request, while the paper is under review. Please email aditya.joshi@unsw.edu.au.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shadab Ahamed, Eldad Haber</p>
<p>Abstract: Inverse problems, which involve estimating parameters from incomplete or noisy observations, arise in various fields such as medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing. These problems are often ill-posed, requiring regularization techniques to stabilize the solution. In this work, we employ $\textit{Stochastic Interpolation}$ (SI), a generative framework that integrates both deterministic and stochastic processes to map a simple reference distribution, such as a Gaussian, to the target distribution. Our method $\textbf{DAWN-SI}$: $\textbf{D}$ata-$\textbf{AW}$are and $\textbf{N}$oise-informed $\textbf{S}$tochastic $\textbf{I}$nterpolation incorporates data and noise embedding, allowing the model to access representations about the measured data explicitly and also account for noise in the observations, making it particularly robust in scenarios where data is noisy or incomplete. By learning a time-dependent velocity field, SI not only provides accurate solutions but also enables uncertainty quantification by generating multiple plausible outcomes. Unlike pre-trained diffusion models, which may struggle in highly ill-posed settings, our approach is trained specifically for each inverse problem and adapts to varying noise levels. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method through extensive numerical experiments on tasks such as image deblurring and tomography.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> SuMin Oh, WanSoo Kim, HyunJin Kim</p>
<p>Abstract: Efficient exploration remains one of the longstanding problems of deep reinforcement learning. Instead of depending solely on extrinsic rewards from the environments, existing methods use intrinsic rewards to enhance exploration. However, we demonstrate that these methods are vulnerable to Noisy TV and stochasticity. To tackle this problem, we propose Temporally Correlated Latent Exploration (TeCLE), which is a novel intrinsic reward formulation that employs an action-conditioned latent space and temporal correlation. The action-conditioned latent space estimates the probability distribution of states, thereby avoiding the assignment of excessive intrinsic rewards to unpredictable states and effectively addressing both problems. Whereas previous works inject temporal correlation for action selection, the proposed method injects it for intrinsic reward computation. We find that the injected temporal correlation determines the exploratory behaviors of agents. Various experiments show that the environment where the agent performs well depends on the amount of temporal correlation. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed TeCLE is the first approach to consider the action conditioned latent space and temporal correlation for curiosity-driven exploration. We prove that the proposed TeCLE can be robust to the Noisy TV and stochasticity in benchmark environments, including Minigrid and Stochastic Atari.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zijian Zhao, Zhijie Cai, Tingwei Chen, Xiaoyang Li, Hang Li, Guangxu Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: As a key technology in Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), Wi-Fi sensing has gained widespread application in various settings such as homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing the patterns of Channel State Information (CSI), we can obtain information about people's actions for tasks like person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, the CSI is heavily influenced by the environment, such that even minor environmental changes can significantly alter the CSI patterns. This will cause the performance deterioration and even failure when applying the Wi-Fi sensing model trained in one environment to another. To address this problem, we introduce a K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD) model, a few-shot method for cross-domain Wi-Fi sensing. We propose a local distribution alignment method within each category, which outperforms traditional Domain Adaptation (DA) methods based on global alignment. Besides, our method can determine when to stop training, which cannot be realized by most DA methods. As a result, our method is more stable and can be better used in practice. The effectiveness of our method are evaluated in several cross-domain Wi-Fi sensing tasks, including gesture recognition, person identification, fall detection, and action recognition, using both a public dataset and a self-collected dataset. In one-shot scenario, our method achieves accuracy of 93.26%, 81.84%, 77.62%, and 75.30% in the four tasks respectively. To facilitate future research, we will make our code and dataset publicly available upon publication.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jayanie Bogahawatte, Sachith Seneviratne, Maneesha Perera, Saman Halgamuge</p>
<p>Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) that are extensively trained on abundant text data, and customizing the input prompt to enable time series forecasting has received considerable attention. While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaozheng Wen, Jingwen Tong, Yingdong Hu, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a longstanding challenge. This issue has been escalated due to the denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and wider bandwidth in 5G and beyond networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting. WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. Notably, with a small number of measurements, WRF-GS can synthesize new spatial spectra within milliseconds for a given scene, thereby enabling latency-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate that WRF-GS outperforms existing methods for spatial spectrum synthesis, such as ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Moreover, WRF-GS achieves superior performance in the channel state information prediction task, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin of more than 2.43 dB.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ran Tian, Yilin Wu, Chenfeng Xu, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Jitendra Malik, Andrea Bajcsy</p>
<p>Abstract: Visuomotor robot policies, increasingly pre-trained on large-scale datasets, promise significant advancements across robotics domains. However, aligning these policies with end-user preferences remains a challenge, particularly when the preferences are hard to specify. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant mechanism for alignment in non-embodied domains like large language models, it has not seen the same success in aligning visuomotor policies due to the prohibitive amount of human feedback required to learn visual reward functions. To address this limitation, we propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), an observation-only method for learning visual rewards from significantly less human preference feedback. Unlike traditional RLHF, RAPL focuses human feedback on fine-tuning pre-trained vision encoders to align with the end-user's visual representation and then constructs a dense visual reward via feature matching in this aligned representation space. We first validate RAPL through simulation experiments in the X-Magical benchmark and Franka Panda robotic manipulation, demonstrating that it can learn rewards aligned with human preferences, more efficiently uses preference data, and generalizes across robot embodiments. Finally, our hardware experiments align pre-trained Diffusion Policies for three object manipulation tasks. We find that RAPL can fine-tune these policies with 5x less real human preference data, taking the first step towards minimizing human feedback while maximizing visuomotor robot policy alignment.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuan-Heng Wang, Hoshin V. Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the excellent real-world predictive performance of modern machine learning (ML) methods, many scientists remain hesitant to discard traditional physical-conceptual (PC) approaches due mainly to their relative interpretability, which contributes to credibility during decision-making. In this context, a currently underexplored aspect of ML is how to develop minimally-optimal representations that can facilitate better insight regarding system functioning. Regardless of how this is achieved, it is arguably true that parsimonious representations better support the advancement of scientific understanding. Our own view is that ML-based modeling of geoscientific systems should be based in the use of computational units that are fundamentally interpretable by design.
  This paper continues our exploration of how the strengths of ML can be exploited in the service of better understanding via scientific investigation. Here, we use the Mass Conserving Perceptron (MCP) as the fundamental computational unit in a generic network architecture consisting of nodes arranged in series and parallel to explore several generic and important issues related to the use of observational data for constructing input-state-output models of dynamical systems. In the context of lumped catchment modeling, we show that physical interpretability and excellent predictive performance can both be achieved using a relatively parsimonious distributed-state multiple-flow-path network with context-dependent gating and information sharing across the nodes, suggesting that MCP-based modeling can play a significant role in application of ML to geoscientific investigation.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Avaneesh Devkota, Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Currently, state-of-the-art RL methods excel in single-task settings, but they still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to catastrophic forgetting challenges, where previously learned tasks are forgotten as new tasks are introduced. This multi-task learning capability is significantly important for generalist agents, where adaptation features are highly required (e.g., autonomous robots). On the other hand, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as alternative energy-efficient neural network algorithms due to their sparse spike-based operations. Toward this, we propose MTSpark, a novel methodology to enable multi-task RL using spiking networks. Specifically, MTSpark develops a Deep Spiking Q-Network (DSQN) with active dendrites and dueling structure by leveraging task-specific context signals. Specifically, each neuron computes task-dependent activations that dynamically modulate inputs, forming specialized sub-networks for each task. Moreover, this bioplausible network model also benefits from SNNs, enhancing energy efficiency and making the model suitable for hardware implementation. Experimental results show that, our MTSpark effectively learns multiple tasks with higher performance compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MTSpark successfully achieves high score in three Atari games (i.e., Pong: -5.4, Breakout: 0.6, and Enduro: 371.2), reaching human-level performance (i.e., Pong: -3, Breakout: 31, and Enduro: 368), where state-of-the-art struggle to achieve. In addition, our MTSpark also shows better accuracy in image classification tasks than the state-of-the-art. These results highlight the potential of our MTSpark methodology to develop generalist agents that can learn multiple tasks by leveraging both RL and SNN concepts.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fei Gao, Ming Hu, Zhiyu Xie, Peichang Shi, Xiaofei Xie, Guodong Yi, Huaimin Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: With advancements in AI infrastructure and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology, Federated Learning as a Service (FLaaS) through JointCloud Computing (JCC) is promising to break through the resource constraints caused by heterogeneous edge devices in the traditional Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Specifically, with the protection from TEE, data owners can achieve efficient model training with high-performance AI services in the cloud. By providing additional FL services, cloud service providers can achieve collaborative learning among data owners. However, FLaaS still faces three challenges, i.e., i) low training performance caused by heterogeneous data among data owners, ii) high communication overhead among different clouds (i.e., data centers), and iii) lack of efficient resource scheduling strategies to balance training time and cost. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel asynchronous FL approach named NebulaFL for collaborative model training among multiple clouds. To address data heterogeneity issues, NebulaFL adopts a version control-based asynchronous FL training scheme in each data center to balance training time among data owners. To reduce communication overhead, NebulaFL adopts a decentralized model rotation mechanism to achieve effective knowledge sharing among data centers. To balance training time and cost, NebulaFL integrates a reward-guided strategy for data owners selection and resource scheduling. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art FL methods, NebulaFL can achieve up to 5.71\% accuracy improvement. In addition, NebulaFL can reduce up to 50% communication overhead and 61.94% costs under a target accuracy.</p>

<p>Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most widespread liver disorders on a global scale, posing a significant threat of progressing to more severe conditions like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnosing and staging NAFLD presents challenges due to its non-specific symptoms and the invasive nature of liver biopsies. Our research introduces a novel artificial intelligence cascade model employing ensemble learning and feature fusion techniques. We developed a non-invasive, robust, and reliable diagnostic artificial intelligence tool that utilizes anthropometric and laboratory parameters, facilitating early detection and intervention in NAFLD progression. Our novel artificial intelligence achieved an 86% accuracy rate for the NASH steatosis staging task (non-NASH, steatosis grade 1, steatosis grade 2, and steatosis grade 3) and an impressive 96% AUC-ROC for distinguishing between NASH (steatosis grade 1, grade 2, and grade3) and non-NASH cases, outperforming current state-of-the-art models. This notable improvement in diagnostic performance underscores the potential application of artificial intelligence in the early diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD, leading to better patient outcomes and a reduced healthcare burden associated with advanced liver disease.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yongxin Wang, Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Jin Jiang, Yuhao Cheng, Xiaodan Liang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.</p>

<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes of human-machine interaction, leading to the accumulation of vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. A conversational life-cycle spans from the Prelude through the Interlocution to the Epilogue, encompassing various elements.

To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative research task $\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. Inspired by imitation learning, we further build the agent which possesses the adept ability to model dialogue elements based on the DEMO benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that existing LLMs still exhibit considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent has superior performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace is advancing rapidly, necessitating robust metrics to evaluate its tangible impact on the labour market. Existing measures of AI occupational exposure largely focus on AI's theoretical potential to substitute or complement human labour on the basis of technical feasibility, providing limited insight into actual adoption and offering inadequate guidance for policymakers. To address this gap, we introduce the AI Startup Exposure (AISE) index-a novel metric based on occupational descriptions from O*NET and AI applications developed by startups funded by the Y Combinator accelerator. Our findings indicate that while high-skilled professions are theoretically highly exposed according to conventional metrics, they are heterogeneously targeted by startups. Roles involving routine organizational tasks-such as data analysis and office management-display significant exposure, while occupations involving tasks that are less amenable to AI automation due to ethical or high-stakes, more than feasibility, considerations -- such as judges or surgeons -- present lower AISE scores. By focusing on venture-backed AI applications, our approach offers a nuanced perspective on how AI is reshaping the labour market. It challenges the conventional assumption that high-skilled jobs uniformly face high AI risks, highlighting instead the role of today's AI players' societal desirability-driven and market-oriented choices as critical determinants of AI exposure. Contrary to fears of widespread job displacement, our findings suggest that AI adoption will be gradual and shaped by social factors as much as by the technical feasibility of AI applications. This framework provides a dynamic, forward-looking tool for policymakers and stakeholders to monitor AI's evolving impact and navigate the changing labour landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in image generation, mastering tasks such as unconditional image synthesis, text-image translation, and image-to-image conversions. However, their capability falls short in the realm of video prediction, mainly because they treat videos as a collection of independent images, relying on external constraints such as temporal attention mechanisms to enforce temporal coherence. In our paper, we introduce a novel model class, that treats video as a continuous multi-dimensional process rather than a series of discrete frames. We also report a reduction of 75\% sampling steps required to sample a new frame thus making our framework more efficient during the inference time. Through extensive experimentation, we establish state-of-the-art performance in video prediction, validated on benchmark datasets including KTH, BAIR, Human3.6M, and UCF101.

<p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach for uncertainty-aware retinal layer segmentation in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans using probabilistic signed distance functions (SDF). Traditional pixel-wise and regression-based methods primarily encounter difficulties in precise segmentation and lack of geometrical grounding respectively. To address these shortcomings, our methodology refines the segmentation by predicting a signed distance function (SDF) that effectively parameterizes the retinal layer shape via level set. We further enhance the framework by integrating probabilistic modeling, applying Gaussian distributions to encapsulate the uncertainty in the shape parameterization. This ensures a robust representation of the retinal layer morphology even in the presence of ambiguous input, imaging noise, and unreliable segmentations. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate superior performance when compared to other methods. Additionally, we conducted experiments on artificially distorted datasets with various noise types-shadowing, blinking, speckle, and motion-common in OCT scans to showcase the effectiveness of our uncertainty estimation. Our findings demonstrate the possibility to obtain reliable segmentation of retinal layers, as well as an initial step towards the characterization of layer integrity, a key biomarker for disease progression.

<p>Abstract: Semantic representations are integral to natural language processing, psycholinguistics, and artificial intelligence. Although often derived from internet text, recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of behavior-based (e.g., free associations) and brain-based (e.g., fMRI) representations, which promise improvements in our ability to measure and model human representations. We carry out the first systematic evaluation of the similarities and differences between semantic representations derived from text, behavior, and brain data. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that word vectors derived from behavior and brain data encode information that differs from their text-derived cousins. Furthermore, drawing on our psychNorms metabase, alongside an interpretability method that we call representational content analysis, we find that, in particular, behavior representations capture unique variance on certain affective, agentic, and socio-moral dimensions. We thus establish behavior as an important complement to text for capturing human representations and behavior. These results are broadly relevant to research aimed at learning human-aligned semantic representations, including work on evaluating and aligning large language models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ryota Nonomura, Hiroki Mori</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called "Murder Mystery Agents" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the "Murder Mystery" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haotian Ye, Axel Wisiorek, Antonis Maronikolakis, \"Ozge Ala\c{c}am, Hinrich Sch\"utze</p>
<p>Abstract: Hate speech online remains an understudied issue for marginalized communities, and has seen rising relevance, especially in the Global South, which includes developing societies with increasing internet penetration. In this paper, we aim to provide marginalized communities living in societies where the dominant language is low-resource with a privacy-preserving tool to protect themselves from hate speech on the internet by filtering offensive content in their native languages. Our contribution in this paper is twofold: 1) we release REACT (REsponsive hate speech datasets Across ConTexts), a collection of high-quality, culture-specific hate speech detection datasets comprising seven distinct target groups in eight low-resource languages, curated by experienced data collectors; 2) we propose a solution to few-shot hate speech detection utilizing federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving and collaborative learning approach, to continuously improve a central model that exhibits robustness when tackling different target groups and languages. By keeping the training local to the users' devices, we ensure the privacy of the users' data while benefitting from the efficiency of federated learning. Furthermore, we personalize client models to target-specific training data and evaluate their performance. Our results indicate the effectiveness of FL across different target groups, whereas the benefits of personalization on few-shot learning are not clear.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Peng Yu, Cheng Deng, Beiya Dai, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen</p>
<p>Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) pre-trained by next token prediction are inherently proficient in generative tasks. However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Thomas Bartz-Beielstein, Axel Wellendorf, Noah P\"utz, Jens Brandt, Alexander Hinterleitner, Richard Schulz, Richard Scholz, Olaf Mersmann, Robin Knabe</p>
<p>Abstract: The increasing shortage of nursing staff and the acute risk of falls in nursing homes pose significant challenges for the healthcare system. This study presents the development of an automated fall detection system integrated into care beds, aimed at enhancing patient safety without compromising privacy through wearables or video monitoring. Mechanical vibrations transmitted through the bed frame are processed using a short-time Fourier transform, enabling robust classification of distinct human fall patterns with a convolutional neural network. Challenges pertaining to the quantity and diversity of the data are addressed, proposing the generation of additional data with a specific emphasis on enhancing variation. While the model shows promising results in distinguishing fall events from noise using lab data, further testing in real-world environments is recommended for validation and improvement. Despite limited available data, the proposed system shows the potential for an accurate and rapid response to falls, mitigating health implications, and addressing the needs of an aging population. This case study was performed as part of the ZIM Project. Further research on sensors enhanced by artificial intelligence will be continued in the ShapeFuture Project.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raphael C. Engelhardt, Marcel J. Meinen, Moritz Lange, Laurenz Wiskott, Wolfgang Konen</p>
<p>Abstract: In previous research, we developed methods to train decision trees (DT) as agents for reinforcement learning tasks, based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) networks. The samples from which the DTs are built, use the environment's state as features and the corresponding action as label. To solve the nontrivial task of selecting samples, which on one hand reflect the DRL agent's capabilities of choosing the right action but on the other hand also cover enough state space to generalize well, we developed an algorithm to iteratively train DTs.
  In this short paper, we apply this algorithm to a real-world implementation of a robotic task for the first time. Real-world tasks pose additional challenges compared to simulations, such as noise and delays. The task consists of a physical pendulum attached to a cart, which moves on a linear track. By movements to the left and to the right, the pendulum is to be swung in the upright position and balanced in the unstable equilibrium. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm to real-world tasks by generating a DT whose performance matches the performance of the DRL agent, while consisting of fewer parameters. This research could be a starting point for distilling DTs from DRL agents to obtain transparent, lightweight models for real-world reinforcement learning tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohd Faiz Ansari, Rakshit Sandilya, Mohammed Javed, David Doermann</p>
<p>Abstract: Road anomalies can be defined as irregularities on the road surface or in the surface itself. Some may be intentional (such as speedbumps), accidental (such as materials falling off a truck), or the result of roads' excessive use or low or no maintenance, such as potholes. Despite their varying origins, these irregularities often harm vehicles substantially. Speed bumps are intentionally placed for safety but are dangerous due to their non-standard shape, size, and lack of proper markings. Potholes are unintentional and can also cause severe damage. To address the detection of these anomalies, we need an automated road monitoring system. Today, various systems exist that use visual information to track these anomalies. Still, due to poor lighting conditions and improper or missing markings, they may go undetected and have severe consequences for public transport, automated vehicles, etc. In this paper, the Enhanced Temporal-BiLSTM Network (ETLNet) is introduced as a novel approach that integrates two Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) layers with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer. This combination is tailored to detect anomalies effectively irrespective of lighting conditions, as it depends not on visuals but smartphone inertial sensor data. Our methodology employs accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, typically in smartphones, to gather data on road conditions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the ETLNet model maintains an F1-score for detecting speed bumps of 99.3%. The ETLNet model's robustness and efficiency significantly advance automated road surface monitoring technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> ZeinabSadat Taghavi, Hossein Mirzaei</p>
<p>Abstract: There have been several efforts in backdoor attacks, but these have primarily focused on the closed-set performance of classifiers (i.e., classification). This has left a gap in addressing the threat to classifiers' open-set performance, referred to as outlier detection in the literature. Reliable outlier detection is crucial for deploying classifiers in critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. First, we show that existing backdoor attacks fall short in affecting the open-set performance of classifiers, as they have been specifically designed to confuse intra-closed-set decision boundaries. In contrast, an effective backdoor attack for outlier detection needs to confuse the decision boundary between the closed and open sets. Motivated by this, in this study, we propose BATOD, a novel Backdoor Attack targeting the Outlier Detection task. Specifically, we design two categories of triggers to shift inlier samples to outliers and vice versa. We evaluate BATOD using various real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior ability to degrade the open-set performance of classifiers compared to previous attacks, both before and after applying defenses.</p>

<p>Abstract: Is it possible to integrate a humanoid social robot into the work processes or customer care in an official environment, e.g. in municipal offices? If so, what could such an application scenario look like and what skills would the robot need to have when interacting with human customers? What are requirements for this kind of interactions? We have devised an application scenario for such a case, determined the necessary or desirable capabilities of the robot, developed a corresponding robot application and carried out initial tests and evaluations in a project together with the Kiel City Council. One of the most important insights gained in the project was that a humanoid robot with natural language processing capabilities based on large language models as well as human-like gestures and posture changes (animations) proved to be much more preferred by users compared to standard browser-based solutions on tablets for an information system in the City Council. Furthermore, we propose a connection of the ACT-R cognitive architecture with the robot, where an ACT-R model is used in interaction with the robot application to cognitively process and enhance a dialogue between human and robot.</p>

<p>Abstract: Social robots are becoming more and more perceptible in public service settings. For engaging people in a natural environment a smooth social interaction as well as acceptance by the users are important issues for future successful Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The type of verbal communication has a special significance here. In this paper we investigate the effects of spoken language varieties of a non-standard/regional language compared to standard language. More precisely we compare a human dialog with a humanoid social robot Pepper where the robot on the one hand is answering in High German and on the other hand in Low German, a regional language that is understood and partly still spoken in the northern parts of Germany. The content of what the robot says remains the same in both variants. We are interested in the effects that these two different ways of robot talk have on human interlocutors who are more or less familiar with Low German in terms of perceived warmth, competence and possible discomfort in conversation against a background of cultural identity. To measure these factors we use the Robotic Social Attributes Scale (RoSAS) on 17 participants with an age ranging from 19 to 61. Our results show that significantly higher warmth is perceived in the Low German version of the conversation.</p>

<p>Abstract: Following an earthquake, it is vital to quickly evaluate the safety of the impacted areas. Damage detection systems, powered by computer vision and deep learning, can assist experts in this endeavor. However, the lack of extensive, labeled datasets poses a challenge to the development of these systems. In this study, we introduce a technique for generating semi-synthetic images to be used as data augmentation during the training of a damage detection system. We specifically aim to generate images of cracks, which are a prevalent and indicative form of damage. The central concept is to employ parametric meta-annotations to guide the process of generating cracks on 3D models of real-word structures. The governing parameters of these meta-annotations can be adjusted iteratively to yield images that are optimally suited for improving detectors' performance. Comparative evaluations demonstrated that a crack detection system trained with a combination of real and semi-synthetic images outperforms a system trained on real images alone.</p>

<p>Abstract: This manuscript signals a new era in the integration of artificial intelligence with software engineering, placing machines at the pinnacle of coding capability. We present a formalized, iterative methodology proving that AI can fully replace human programmers in all aspects of code creation and refinement.

This surpasses previously assumed limits, signaling the end of human-exclusive coding and the rise of autonomous AI-driven software innovation. More than a technical advance, our work challenges centuries-old assumptions about human creativity. We provide robust evidence of AI superiority, demonstrating tangible gains in practical engineering contexts and laying the foundation for a future in which computational creativity outpaces human ingenuity.</p>

<p>Abstract: The proliferation of large language models has raised growing concerns about their misuse, particularly in cases where AI-generated text is falsely attributed to human authors. Machine-generated content detectors claim to effectively identify such text under various conditions and from any language model. This paper critically evaluates these claims by assessing several popular detectors (RADAR, Wild, T5Sentinel, Fast-DetectGPT, GPTID, LogRank, Binoculars) on a range of domains, datasets, and models that these detectors have not previously encountered. We employ various prompting strategies to simulate adversarial attacks, demonstrating that even moderate efforts can significantly evade detection. We emphasize the importance of the true positive rate at a specific false positive rate (TPR@FPR) metric and demonstrate that these detectors perform poorly in certain settings, with TPR@.01 as low as 0\%. Our findings suggest that both trained and zero-shot detectors struggle to maintain high sensitivity while achieving a reasonable true positive rate.</p>

<p>Abstract: Explanations of machine learning (ML) model predictions generated by Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP are essential for people using ML outputs for decision-making. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform these explanations into human-readable, narrative formats that align with natural communication. We address two key research questions: (1) Can LLMs reliably transform traditional explanations into high-quality narratives? and (2) How can we effectively evaluate the quality of narrative explanations? To answer these questions, we introduce Explingo, which consists of two LLM-based subsystems, a Narrator and Grader. The Narrator takes in ML explanations and transforms them into natural-language descriptions. The Grader scores these narratives on a set of metrics including accuracy, completeness, fluency, and conciseness.
  Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate high-quality narratives that achieve high scores across all metrics, particularly when guided by a small number of human-labeled and bootstrapped examples. We also identified areas that remain challenging, in particular for effectively scoring narratives in complex domains. The findings from this work have been integrated into an open-source tool that makes narrative explanations available for further applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled personalized image creation with both user-defined subjects (content) and styles. Prior works achieved personalization by merging corresponding low-rank adaptation parameters (LoRAs) through optimization-based methods, which are computationally demanding and unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. To address this, we introduce LoRA.rar, a method that not only improves image quality but also achieves a remarkable speedup of over $4000\times$ in the merging process. LoRA.rar pre-trains a hypernetwork on a diverse set of content-style LoRA pairs, learning an efficient merging strategy that generalizes to new, unseen content-style pairs, enabling fast, high-quality personalization. Moreover, we identify limitations in existing evaluation metrics for content-style quality and propose a new protocol using multimodal large language models (MLLM) for more accurate assessment. Our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art in both content and style fidelity, as validated by MLLM assessments and human evaluations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Shortcuts, also described as Clever Hans behavior, spurious correlations, or confounders, present a significant challenge in machine learning and AI, critically affecting model generalization and robustness. Research in this area, however, remains fragmented across various terminologies, hindering the progress of the field as a whole. Consequently, we introduce a unifying taxonomy of shortcut learning by providing a formal definition of shortcuts and bridging the diverse terms used in the literature. In doing so, we further establish important connections between shortcuts and related fields, including bias, causality, and security, where parallels exist but are rarely discussed. Our taxonomy organizes existing approaches for shortcut detection and mitigation, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field and revealing underexplored areas and open challenges. Moreover, we compile and classify datasets tailored to study shortcut learning. Altogether, this work provides a holistic perspective to deepen understanding and drive the development of more effective strategies for addressing shortcuts in machine learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaoda Zheng, Feng Wang, Naiyan Wang, Shuguang Cui, Zhen Li</p>
<p>Abstract: While 3D object bounding box (bbox) representation has been widely used in autonomous driving perception, it lacks the ability to capture the precise details of an object's intrinsic geometry. Recently, occupancy has emerged as a promising alternative for 3D scene perception. However, constructing a high-resolution occupancy map remains infeasible for large scenes due to computational constraints. Recognizing that foreground objects only occupy a small portion of the scene, we introduce object-centric occupancy as a supplement to object bboxes. This representation not only provides intricate details for detected objects but also enables higher voxel resolution in practical applications. We advance the development of object-centric occupancy perception from both data and algorithm perspectives. On the data side, we construct the first object-centric occupancy dataset from scratch using an automated pipeline. From the algorithmic standpoint, we introduce a novel object-centric occupancy completion network equipped with an implicit shape decoder that manages dynamic-size occupancy generation. This network accurately predicts the complete object-centric occupancy volume for inaccurate object proposals by leveraging temporal information from long sequences. Our method demonstrates robust performance in completing object shapes under noisy detection and tracking conditions. Additionally, we show that our occupancy features significantly enhance the detection results of state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, especially for incomplete or distant objects in the Waymo Open Dataset.</p>

<p>Abstract: While remarkable success has been achieved through diffusion-based 3D generative models for shapes, 4D generative modeling remains challenging due to the complexity of object deformations over time. We propose DNF, a new 4D representation for unconditional generative modeling that efficiently models deformable shapes with disentangled shape and motion while capturing high-fidelity details in the deforming objects. To achieve this, we propose a dictionary learning approach to disentangle 4D motion from shape as neural fields. Both shape and motion are represented as learned latent spaces, where each deformable shape is represented by its shape and motion global latent codes, shape-specific coefficient vectors, and shared dictionary information. This captures both shape-specific detail and global shared information in the learned dictionary. Our dictionary-based representation well balances fidelity, contiguity and compression -- combined with a transformer-based diffusion model, our method is able to generate effective, high-fidelity 4D animations.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Samuel Schapiro, Han Zhao</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising method to improve generalization by minimizing sharpness, which is known to correlate well with generalization ability. Since the original proposal of SAM, many variants of SAM have been proposed to improve its accuracy and efficiency, but comparisons have mainly been restricted to the i.i.d. setting. In this paper we study SAM for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. First, we perform a comprehensive comparison of eight SAM variants on zero-shot OOD generalization, finding that the original SAM outperforms the Adam baseline by $4.76\%$ and the strongest SAM variants outperform the Adam baseline by $8.01\%$ on average. We then provide an OOD generalization bound in terms of sharpness for this setting. Next, we extend our study of SAM to the related setting of gradual domain adaptation (GDA), another form of OOD generalization where intermediate domains are constructed between the source and target domains, and iterative self-training is done on intermediate domains, to improve the overall target domain error. In this setting, our experimental results demonstrate that the original SAM outperforms the baseline of Adam on each of the experimental datasets by $0.82\%$ on average and the strongest SAM variants outperform Adam by $1.52\%$ on average. We then provide a generalization bound for SAM in the GDA setting. Asymptotically, this generalization bound is no better than the one for self-training in the literature of GDA. This highlights a further disconnection between the theoretical justification for SAM versus its empirical performance, with recent work finding that low sharpness alone does not account for all of SAM's generalization benefits. For future work, we provide several potential avenues for obtaining a tighter analysis for SAM in the OOD setting.</p>

<p>Abstract: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for working with natural language, bringing advances in many areas of computational linguistics. However, these models face challenges when applied to low-resource languages due to limited training data and difficulty in understanding cultural nuances. In this paper, we propose QueEn, a novel approach for Quechua-English translation that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Our method leverages external linguistic resources through RAG and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient model adaptation. Experimental results show that our approach substantially exceeds baseline models, with a BLEU score of 17.6 compared to 1.5 for standard GPT models. The integration of RAG with fine-tuning allows our system to address the challenges of low-resource language translation while maintaining computational efficiency. This work contributes to the broader goal of preserving endangered languages through advanced language technologies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yohann Perron, Vladyslav Sydorov, Adam P. Wijker, Damian Evans, Christophe Pottier, Loic Landrieu</p>
<p>Abstract: Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) technology has transformed modern archaeology by unveiling hidden landscapes beneath dense vegetation. However, the lack of expert-annotated, open-access resources has hindered the analysis of ALS data using advanced deep learning techniques. We address this limitation with Archaeoscape (available at https://archaeoscape.ai), a novel large-scale archaeological ALS dataset spanning 888 km$^2$ in Cambodia with 31,141 annotated archaeological features from the Angkorian period. Archaeoscape is over four times larger than comparable datasets, and the first ALS archaeology resource with open-access data, annotations, and models.
  We benchmark several recent segmentation models to demonstrate the benefits of modern vision techniques for this problem and highlight the unique challenges of discovering subtle human-made structures under dense jungle canopies. By making Archaeoscape available in open access, we hope to bridge the gap between traditional archaeology and modern computer vision methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Kaustubh D. Dhole, Kai Shu, Eugene Agichtein</p>
<p>Abstract: Computational argumentation, which involves generating answers or summaries for controversial topics like abortion bans and vaccination, has become increasingly important in today's polarized environment. Sophisticated LLM capabilities offer the potential to provide nuanced, evidence-based answers to such questions through Retrieval-Augmented Argumentation (RAArg), leveraging real-world evidence for high-quality, grounded arguments. However, evaluating RAArg remains challenging, as human evaluation is costly and difficult for complex, lengthy answers on complicated topics. At the same time, re-using existing argumentation datasets is no longer sufficient, as they lack long, complex arguments and realistic evidence from potentially misleading sources, limiting holistic evaluation of retrieval effectiveness and argument quality. To address these gaps, we investigate automated evaluation methods using multiple fine-grained LLM judges, providing better and more interpretable assessments than traditional single-score metrics and even previously reported human crowdsourcing. To validate the proposed techniques, we introduce ConQRet, a new benchmark featuring long and complex human-authored arguments on debated topics, grounded in real-world websites, allowing an exhaustive evaluation across retrieval effectiveness, argument quality, and groundedness. We validate our LLM Judges on a prior dataset and the new ConQRet benchmark. Our proposed LLM Judges and the ConQRet benchmark can enable rapid progress in computational argumentation and can be naturally extended to other complex retrieval-augmented generation tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sepideh Bazazi, Jurgis Karpus, Taha Yasseri</p>
<p>Abstract: Cooperation between humans and machines is increasingly vital as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into daily life. Research indicates that people are often less willing to cooperate with AI agents than with humans, more readily exploiting AI for personal gain. While prior studies have shown that giving AI agents human-like features influences people's cooperation with them, the impact of AI's assigned gender remains underexplored. This study investigates how human cooperation varies based on gender labels assigned to AI agents with which they interact. In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, 402 participants interacted with partners labelled as AI (bot) or humans. The partners were also labelled male, female, non-binary, or gender-neutral. Results revealed that participants tended to exploit female-labelled and distrust male-labelled AI agents more than their human counterparts, reflecting gender biases similar to those in human-human interactions. These findings highlight the significance of gender biases in human-AI interactions that must be considered in future policy, design of interactive AI systems, and regulation of their use.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wazib Ansar, Saptarsi Goswami, Amlan Chakrabarti</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements make deployment on devices with constrained resources extremely difficult. Among various efficiency considerations, model binarization and Early Exit (EE) are common effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss due to reduced precision affecting gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, the present early-exit mechanisms are still in the nascent stages of research. To ameliorate these issues, we propose Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning transformer architecture to combine early exit with binarization for textual inference. It improves the binarization process through a differentiable second-order approximation to the impulse function. This enables gradient computation concerning both the sign as well as the magnitude of the weights. In contrast to absolute threshold-based EE, the proposed EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. While binarization results in 18.44 times reduction in model size, early exit reduces the FLOPs during inference by 54.85% and even improves accuracy by 5.98% through resolving the "overthinking" problem inherent in deep networks. Moreover, the proposed BEExformer simplifies training by not requiring knowledge distillation from a full-precision LLM. Extensive evaluation on the GLUE dataset and comparison with the SOTA works showcase its pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaohui Chen, Satya Narayan Shukla, Mahmoud Azab, Aashu Singh, Qifan Wang, David Yang, ShengYun Peng, Hanchao Yu, Shen Yan, Xuewen Zhang, Baosheng He</p>
<p>Abstract: How well can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand composite images? Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: How to best develop foundational models for time series forecasting remains an important open question. Tokenization is a crucial consideration in this effort: what is an effective discrete vocabulary for a real-valued sequential input? To address this question, we develop WaveToken, a wavelet-based tokenizer that allows models to learn complex representations directly in the space of time-localized frequencies. Our method first scales and decomposes the input time series, then thresholds and quantizes the wavelet coefficients, and finally pre-trains an autoregressive model to forecast coefficients for the forecast horizon. By decomposing coarse and fine structures in the inputs, wavelets provide an eloquent and compact language for time series forecasting that simplifies learning. Empirical results on a comprehensive benchmark, including 42 datasets for both in-domain and zero-shot settings, show that WaveToken: i) provides better accuracy than recently proposed foundation models for forecasting while using a much smaller vocabulary (1024 tokens), and performs on par or better than modern deep learning models trained specifically on each dataset; and ii) exhibits superior generalization capabilities, achieving the best average rank across all datasets for three complementary metrics. In addition, we show that our method can easily capture complex temporal patterns of practical relevance that are challenging for other recent pre-trained models, including trends, sparse spikes, and non-stationary time series with varying frequencies evolving over time.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Javier Mu\~noz, \'Alvaro Huertas-Garc\'ia, Carlos Mart\'i-Gonz\'alez, Enrique De Miguel Ambite</p>
<p>Abstract: The opaque nature of transformer-based models, particularly in applications susceptible to unethical practices such as dark-patterns in user interfaces, requires models that integrate uncertainty quantification to enhance trust in predictions. This study focuses on dark-pattern detection, deceptive design choices that manipulate user decisions, undermining autonomy and consent. We propose a differential fine-tuning approach implemented at the final classification head via uncertainty quantification with transformer-based pre-trained models. Employing a dense neural network (DNN) head architecture as a baseline, we examine two methods capable of quantifying uncertainty: Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). These methods are evaluated on a set of open-source foundational models across multiple dimensions: model performance, variance in certainty of predictions and environmental impact during training and inference phases. Results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty quantification maintains performance while providing insights into challenging instances within the models. Moreover, the study reveals that the environmental impact does not uniformly increase with the incorporation of uncertainty quantification techniques. The study's findings demonstrate that uncertainty quantification enhances transparency and provides measurable confidence in predictions, improving the explainability and clarity of black-box models. This facilitates informed decision-making and mitigates the influence of dark-patterns on user interfaces. These results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques in developing machine learning models, particularly in domains where interpretability and trustworthiness are critical.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Fnu Neha, Deepshikha Bhati, Deepak Kumar Shukla, Md Amiruzzaman</p>
<p>Abstract: Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision and image understanding, with the goal of identifying and localizing objects of interest within an image while assigning them corresponding class labels. Traditional methods, which relied on handcrafted features and shallow models, struggled with complex visual data and showed limited performance. These methods combined low-level features with contextual information and lacked the ability to capture high-level semantics. Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), addressed these limitations by automatically learning rich, hierarchical features directly from data. These features include both semantic and high-level representations essential for accurate object detection. This paper reviews object detection frameworks, starting with classical computer vision methods. We categorize object detection approaches into two groups: (1) classical computer vision techniques and (2) CNN-based detectors. We compare major CNN models, discussing their strengths and limitations. In conclusion, this review highlights the significant advancements in object detection through deep learning and identifies key areas for further research to improve performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiangyu Han, Zhen Jia, Boyi Li, Yan Wang, Boris Ivanovic, Yurong You, Lingjie Liu, Yue Wang, Marco Pavone, Chen Feng, Yiming Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Photorealistic simulators are essential for the training and evaluation of vision-centric autonomous vehicles (AVs). At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting methods across different difficulty levels. Our results show that Gaussian Splatting is prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and large-scale training. We have released our data to help advance self-driving and urban robotics simulation technology.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Krzysztof Maziarz, Guoqing Liu, Hubert Misztela, Aleksei Kornev, Piotr Gai\'nski, Holger Hoefling, Mike Fortunato, Rishi Gupta, Marwin Segler</p>
<p>Abstract: Planning and conducting chemical syntheses remains a major bottleneck in the discovery of functional small molecules, and prevents fully leveraging generative AI for molecular inverse design. While early work has shown that ML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low accuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As multi-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the underlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by the accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use different strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for building highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse sources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling strategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which already by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits, we show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to the good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the scalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level organic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of quality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.</p>

<h1> cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05270">APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Hanqing Zhu, Zhenyu Zhang, Wenyan Cong, Xi Liu, Sem Park, Vikas Chandra, Bo Long, David Z. Pan, Zhangyang Wang, Jinwon Lee</p>
<p>Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.
  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.</p>

Our approach does not require training and works on test-time by leveraging the inherent capabilities of pre-trained video diffusion models. In contrast to traditional approaches, which struggle with comprehensive scene changes while maintaining consistent motion, MotionFlow successfully handles such complex transformations through its attention-based mechanism. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MotionFlow significantly outperforms existing models in both fidelity and versatility even during drastic scene alterations.</p>

<p>Abstract: 4D driving simulation is essential for developing realistic autonomous driving simulators. Despite advancements in existing methods for generating driving scenes, significant challenges remain in view transformation and spatial-temporal dynamic modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Spatial-Temporal simulAtion for drivinG (Stag-1) model to reconstruct real-world scenes and design a controllable generative network to achieve 4D simulation. Stag-1 constructs continuous 4D point cloud scenes using surround-view data from autonomous vehicles. It decouples spatial-temporal relationships and produces coherent keyframe videos. Additionally, Stag-1 leverages video generation models to obtain photo-realistic and controllable 4D driving simulation videos from any perspective. To expand the range of view generation, we train vehicle motion videos based on decomposed camera poses, enhancing modeling capabilities for distant scenes. Furthermore, we reconstruct vehicle camera trajectories to integrate 3D points across consecutive views, enabling comprehensive scene understanding along the temporal dimension. Following extensive multi-level scene training, Stag-1 can simulate from any desired viewpoint and achieve a deep understanding of scene evolution under static spatial-temporal conditions. Compared to existing methods, our approach shows promising performance in multi-view scene consistency, background coherence, and accuracy, and contributes to the ongoing advancements in realistic autonomous driving simulation.

<p>Abstract: Task oriented Dialogue Systems generally employ intent detection systems in order to map user queries to a set of pre-defined intents. However, user queries appearing in natural language can be easily ambiguous and hence such a direct mapping might not be straightforward harming intent detection and eventually the overall performance of a dialogue system. Moreover, acquiring domain-specific clarification questions is costly. In order to disambiguate queries which are ambiguous between two intents, we propose a novel method of generating discriminative questions using a simple rule based system which can take advantage of any question generation system without requiring annotated data of clarification questions. Our approach aims at discrimination between two intents but can be easily extended to clarification over multiple intents. Seeking clarification from the user to classify user intents not only helps understand the user intent effectively, but also reduces the roboticity of the conversation and makes the interaction considerably natural.</p>

<p>Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a pivotal technique for augmenting the inferential capabilities of language models during reasoning tasks. Despite its advancements, CoT often grapples with challenges in validating reasoning validity and ensuring informativeness. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces the Logic Agent (LA), an agent-based framework aimed at enhancing the validity of reasoning processes in Large Language Models (LLMs) through strategic logic rule invocation. Unlike conventional approaches, LA transforms LLMs into logic agents that dynamically apply propositional logic rules, initiating the reasoning process by converting natural language inputs into structured logic forms. The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process. This methodology not only promotes the structured and coherent generation of reasoning constructs but also significantly improves their interpretability and logical coherence. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate LA's capacity to scale effectively across various model sizes, markedly improving the precision of complex reasoning across diverse tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Analog layout synthesis faces significant challenges due to its dependence on manual processes, considerable time requirements, and performance instability. Current Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based techniques for analog layout synthesis, despite their potential for automation, suffer from slow convergence and extensive data needs, limiting their practical application.

Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{LLANA} not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) BO methods but also enables a more effective exploration of the analog circuit design space, thanks to LLM's superior contextual understanding and learning efficiency.

<p>Abstract: Job shop scheduling problems (JSSPs) represent a critical and challenging class of combinatorial optimization problems. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve JSSPs, albeit lacking a systematic survey of the relevant literature. This paper aims to thoroughly review prevailing GNN methods for different types of JSSPs and the closely related flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), especially those leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We begin by presenting the graph representations of various JSSPs, followed by an introduction to the most commonly used GNN architectures. We then review current GNN-based methods for each problem type, highlighting key technical elements such as graph representations, GNN architectures, GNN tasks, and training algorithms. Finally, we summarize and analyze the advantages and limitations of GNNs in solving JSSPs and provide potential future research opportunities. We hope this survey can motivate and inspire innovative approaches for more powerful GNN-based approaches in tackling JSSPs and other scheduling problems.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Haocheng Lin</p>
<p>Abstract: The popularisation of applying AI in businesses poses significant challenges relating to ethical principles, governance, and legal compliance. Although businesses have embedded AI into their day-to-day processes, they lack a unified approach for mitigating its potential risks. This paper introduces a framework ensuring that AI must be ethical, controllable, viable, and desirable. Balancing these factors ensures the design of a framework that addresses its trade-offs, such as balancing performance against explainability. A successful framework provides practical advice for businesses to meet regulatory requirements in sectors such as finance and healthcare, where it is critical to comply with standards like GPDR and the EU AI Act. Different case studies validate this framework by integrating AI in both academic and practical environments. For instance, large language models are cost-effective alternatives for generating synthetic opinions that emulate attitudes to environmental issues. These case studies demonstrate how having a structured framework could enhance transparency and maintain performance levels as shown from the alignment between synthetic and expected distributions. This alignment is quantified using metrics like Chi-test scores, normalized mutual information, and Jaccard indexes. Future research should explore the framework's empirical validation in diverse industrial settings further, ensuring the model's scalability and adaptability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Th\'eo Fagnoni, Bellinda Mesbah, Mahsun Altin, Phillip Kingston</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper introduces Opus, a novel framework for generating and optimizing Workflows tailored to complex Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) use cases, focusing on cost reduction and quality enhancement while adhering to established industry processes and operational constraints. Our approach generates executable Workflows from Intention, defined as the alignment of Client Input, Client Output, and Process Context. These Workflows are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), with nodes as Tasks consisting of sequences of executable Instructions, including tools and human expert reviews. We adopt a two-phase methodology: Workflow Generation and Workflow Optimization. In the Generation phase, Workflows are generated using a Large Work Model (LWM) informed by a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) that encodes domain-specific procedural and operational knowledge. In the Optimization phase, Workflows are transformed into Workflow Graphs (WFGs), where optimal Workflows are determined through path optimization. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in reliably retrieving detailed process data as well as generating industry-compliant workflows. The key contributions of this paper include integrating a Work Knowledge Graph (WKG) into a Large Work Model (LWM) to enable the generation of context-aware, semantically aligned, structured and auditable Workflows. It further introduces a two-phase approach that combines Workflow Generation from Intention with graph-based Workflow Optimization. Finally, we present Opus Alpha 1 Large and Opus Alpha 1 Small that outperform state-of-the-art LLMs by 38% and 29% respectively in Workflow Generation for a Medical Coding use case.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jialin Wang, Zhihua Duan</p>
<p>Abstract: This paper presents a Spark-based modular LangGraph framework, designed to enhance machine learning workflows through scalability, visualization, and intelligent process optimization. At its core, the framework introduces Agent AI, a pivotal innovation that leverages Spark's distributed computing capabilities and integrates with LangGraph for workflow orchestration.
  Agent AI facilitates the automation of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation while dynamically interacting with data through Spark SQL and DataFrame agents. Through LangGraph's graph-structured workflows, the agents execute complex tasks, adapt to new inputs, and provide real-time feedback, ensuring seamless decision-making and execution in distributed environments. This system simplifies machine learning processes by allowing users to visually design workflows, which are then converted into Spark-compatible code for high-performance execution.
  The framework also incorporates large language models through the LangChain ecosystem, enhancing interaction with unstructured data and enabling advanced data analysis. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in process efficiency and scalability, as well as accurate data-driven decision-making in diverse application scenarios.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Chaojun Xiao, Jie Cai, Weilin Zhao, Guoyang Zeng, Biyuan Lin, Jie Zhou, Zhi Zheng, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Hugues Turb\'e, Mina Bjelogrlic, Christian Lovis, Gianmarco Mengaldo</p>
<p>Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods are critical tools to explain neural-network results. Several post-hoc methods have emerged in recent years, but when applied to a given task, they produce different results, raising the question of which method is the most suitable to provide correct post-hoc interpretability. To understand the performance of each method, quantitative evaluation of interpretability methods is essential. However, currently available frameworks have several drawbacks which hinders the adoption of post-hoc interpretability methods, especially in high-risk sectors. In this work, we propose a framework with quantitative metrics to assess the performance of existing post-hoc interpretability methods in particular in time series classification. We show that several drawbacks identified in the literature are addressed, namely dependence on human judgement, retraining, and shift in the data distribution when occluding samples. We additionally design a synthetic dataset with known discriminative features and tunable complexity. The proposed methodology and quantitative metrics can be used to understand the reliability of interpretability methods results obtained in practical applications. In turn, they can be embedded within operational workflows in critical fields that require accurate interpretability results for e.g., regulatory policies.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Simiao Ren, Saad Lahrichi, Yang Deng, Willie J. Padilla, Leslie Collins, Jordan Malof</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep active learning (DAL) methods have shown significant improvements in sample efficiency compared to simple random sampling. While these studies are valuable, they nearly always assume that optimal DAL hyperparameter (HP) settings are known in advance, or optimize the HPs through repeating DAL several times with different HP settings. Here, we argue that in real-world settings, or in the wild, there is significant uncertainty regarding good HPs, and their optimization contradicts the premise of using DAL (i.e., we require labeling efficiency). In this study, we evaluate the performance of eleven modern DAL methods on eight benchmark problems as we vary a key HP shared by all methods: the pool ratio. Despite adjusting only one HP, our results indicate that eight of the eleven DAL methods sometimes underperform relative to simple random sampling and some frequently perform worse. Only three methods always outperform random sampling (albeit narrowly), and we find that these methods all utilize diversity to select samples - a relatively simple criterion. Our findings reveal the limitations of existing DAL methods when deployed in the wild, and present this as an important new open problem in the field.</p>

<p>Abstract: The research community has shown increasing interest in designing intelligent embodied agents that can assist humans in accomplishing tasks. Although there have been significant advancements in related vision-language benchmarks, most prior work has focused on building agents that follow instructions rather than endowing agents the ability to ask questions to actively resolve ambiguities arising naturally in embodied environments. To address this gap, we propose an Embodied Learning-By-Asking (ELBA) model that learns when and what questions to ask to dynamically acquire additional information for completing the task. We evaluate ELBA on the TEACh vision-dialog navigation and task completion dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves improved task performance compared to baseline models without question-answering capabilities.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yunlu Yan, Huazhu Fu, Yuexiang Li, Jinheng Xie, Jun Ma, Guang Yang, Lei Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative learning among multiple clients in a distributed manner and ensures the security of privacy. However, its performance inevitably degrades with non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. In this paper, we focus on the feature distribution skewed FL scenario, a common non-IID situation in real-world applications where data from different clients exhibit varying underlying distributions. This variation leads to feature shift, which is a key issue of this scenario. While previous works have made notable progress, few pay attention to the data itself, i.e., the root of this issue. The primary goal of this paper is to mitigate feature shift from the perspective of data. To this end, we propose a simple yet remarkably effective input-level data augmentation method, namely FedRDN, which randomly injects the statistical information of the local distribution from the entire federation into the client's data. This is beneficial to improve the generalization of local feature representations, thereby mitigating feature shift. Moreover, our FedRDN is a plug-and-play component, which can be seamlessly integrated into the data augmentation flow with only a few lines of code. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that the performance of various representative FL methods can be further improved by integrating our FedRDN, demonstrating its effectiveness, strong compatibility and generalizability. Code will be released.</p>

<p>Abstract: This study addresses critical gaps in automated lymphoma segmentation from PET/CT images, focusing on issues often overlooked in existing literature. While deep learning has been applied for lymphoma lesion segmentation, few studies incorporate out-of-distribution testing, raising concerns about model generalizability across diverse imaging conditions and patient populations. We highlight the need to compare model performance with expert human annotators, including intra- and inter-observer variability, to understand task difficulty better. Most approaches focus on overall segmentation accuracy but overlook lesion-specific measures important for precise lesion detection and disease quantification. To address these gaps, we propose a clinically relevant framework for evaluating deep segmentation networks. Using this lesion measure-specific evaluation, we assess the performance of four deep networks (ResUNet, SegResNet, DynUNet, and SwinUNETR) across 611 cases from multi-institutional datasets, covering various lymphoma subtypes and lesion characteristics. Beyond standard metrics like the Dice similarity coefficient, we evaluate clinical lesion measures and their prediction errors. We also introduce detection criteria for lesion localization and propose a new detection Criterion 3 based on metabolic characteristics. We show that networks perform better on large, intense lesions with higher metabolic activity. Finally, we compare network performance to physicians via intra- and inter-observer variability analyses, demonstrating that network errors closely resemble those made by experts, i.e., the small and faint lesions remain challenging for both humans and networks. This study aims to improve automated lesion segmentation's clinical relevance, supporting better treatment decisions for lymphoma patients.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Akash Dhasade, Yaohong Ding, Song Guo, Anne-marie Kermarrec, Martijn De Vos, Leijie Wu</p>
<p>Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to delete specific training data from an ML model trained using Federated Learning (FL). We introduce QuickDrop, an efficient and original FU method that utilizes dataset distillation (DD) to accelerate unlearning and drastically reduces computational overhead compared to existing approaches. In QuickDrop, each client uses DD to generate a compact dataset representative of the original training dataset, called a distilled dataset, and uses this compact dataset during unlearning. To unlearn specific knowledge from the global model, QuickDrop has clients execute Stochastic Gradient Ascent with samples from the distilled datasets, thus significantly reducing computational overhead compared to conventional FU methods. We further increase the efficiency of QuickDrop by ingeniously integrating DD into the FL training process. By reusing the gradient updates produced during FL training for DD, the overhead of creating distilled datasets becomes close to negligible. Evaluations on three standard datasets show that, with comparable accuracy guarantees, QuickDrop reduces the duration of unlearning by 463.8x compared to model retraining from scratch and 65.1x compared to existing FU approaches. We also demonstrate the scalability of QuickDrop with 100 clients and show its effectiveness while handling multiple unlearning operations.</p>

<p>Abstract: Data privacy protection is garnering increased attention among researchers. Diffusion models (DMs), particularly with strict differential privacy, can potentially produce images with both high privacy and visual quality. However, challenges arise such as in ensuring robust protection in privatizing specific data attributes, areas where current models often fall short. To address these challenges, we introduce the PAC Privacy Preserving Diffusion Model, a model leverages diffusion principles and ensure Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) privacy. We enhance privacy protection by integrating a private classifier guidance into the Langevin Sampling Process. Additionally, recognizing the gap in measuring the privacy of models, we have developed a novel metric to gauge privacy levels. Our model, assessed with this new metric and supported by Gaussian matrix computations for the PAC bound, has shown superior performance in privacy protection over existing leading private generative models according to benchmark tests.</p>

The factorization of navigation and manipulation, while effective for some tasks, fails in scenarios requiring coordinated actions.

This approach is validated in simulated and real-world environments and adapts to novel unseen settings without additional tuning. Our contributions include a new benchmark for mobile manipulation and the successful deployment with only RGB visual observation in a real unseen apartment, demonstrating the potential for practical indoor robot deployment in daily life.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zixiang Chen, Huizhuo Yuan, Yongqian Li, Yiwen Kou, Junkai Zhang, Quanquan Gu</p>
<p>Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality data generation. Despite their success in discrete spaces, such as text generation tasks, the acceleration of discrete diffusion models remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose discrete non-Markov diffusion models (DNDM), which naturally induce the predetermined transition time set. This enables a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly reduces the number of function evaluations (i.e., calls to the neural network), making the sampling process much faster. Furthermore, we study the transition from finite to infinite step sampling, offering new insights into bridging the gap between discrete and continuous-time processes for discrete diffusion models. Extensive experiments on natural language generation and machine translation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method in terms of both generation speed and sample quality compared to existing methods for discrete diffusion models.</p>

<p>Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are vital for modern image rendering due to their scalability and versatility. Previous SVG generation methods have focused on curve-based vectorization, lacking semantic understanding, often producing artifacts, and struggling with SVG primitives beyond path curves. To address these issues, we introduce StarVector, a multimodal large language model for SVG generation. It performs image vectorization by understanding image semantics and using SVG primitives for compact, precise outputs. Unlike traditional methods, StarVector works directly in the SVG code space, leveraging visual understanding to apply accurate SVG primitives. To train StarVector, we create SVG-Stack, a diverse dataset of 2M samples that enables generalization across vectorization tasks and precise use of primitives like ellipses, polygons, and text. We address challenges in SVG evaluation, showing that pixel-based metrics like MSE fail to capture the unique qualities of vector graphics. We introduce SVG-Bench, a benchmark across 10 datasets, and 3 tasks: Image-to-SVG, Text-to-SVG generation, and diagram generation. Using this setup, StarVector achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more compact and semantically rich SVGs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Minho Lee, Yun Young Choi, Sun Woo Park, Seunghwan Lee, Joohwan Ko, Jaeyoung Hong</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models have been increasingly adopted to learn the complex vector representations of spatio-temporal graphs, capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies crucial for applications such as traffic datasets. Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

<p>Abstract: In the field of NLP, Large Language Models (LLMs) have markedly enhanced performance across a variety of tasks. However, the comprehensive evaluation of LLMs remains an inevitable challenge for the community. Recently, the adoption of Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) as a benchmark for assessing LLMs has gained considerable traction. However, concerns regarding the robustness of this evaluative method persist. Building upon previous discussions on the issue of \textit{variability}, we reveal an additional dimension of concern: LLMs may perform MCQA by selecting the least incorrect option rather than distinctly correct. This observation suggests that LLMs might regard multiple options as correct, which could undermine the reliability of MCQA as a metric for evaluating LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce an enhanced dataset augmentation method for MCQA, termed MCQA+, to provide a more accurate reflection of the model performance, thereby highlighting the necessity for more sophisticated evaluation mechanisms in the assessment of LLM capabilities.</p>

<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial.

<p><b>Authors:</b> David Buterez, Jon Paul Janet, Dino Oglic, Pietro Lio</p>
<p>Abstract: There has been a recent surge in transformer-based architectures for learning on graphs, mainly motivated by attention as an effective learning mechanism and the desire to supersede handcrafted operators characteristic of message passing schemes. However, concerns over their empirical effectiveness, scalability, and complexity of the pre-processing steps have been raised, especially in relation to much simpler graph neural networks that typically perform on par with them across a wide range of benchmarks. To tackle these shortcomings, we consider graphs as sets of edges and propose a purely attention-based approach consisting of an encoder and an attention pooling mechanism. The encoder vertically interleaves masked and vanilla self-attention modules to learn an effective representations of edges, while allowing for tackling possible misspecifications in input graphs. Despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms fine-tuned message passing baselines and recently proposed transformer-based methods on more than 70 node and graph-level tasks, including challenging long-range benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across different tasks, ranging from molecular to vision graphs, and heterophilous node classification. The approach also outperforms graph neural networks and transformers in transfer learning settings, and scales much better than alternatives with a similar performance level or expressive power.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shuheng Fang, Kangfei Zhao, Yu Rong, Zhixun Li, Jeffrey Xu Yu</p>
<p>Abstract: Cold-start rating prediction is a fundamental problem in recommender systems that has been extensively studied. Many methods have been proposed that exploit explicit relations among existing data, such as collaborative filtering, social recommendations and heterogeneous information network, to alleviate the data insufficiency issue for cold-start users and items. However, the explicit relations constructed based on data between different roles may be unreliable and irrelevant, which limits the performance ceiling of the specific recommendation task. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework dubbed heterogeneous interaction rating network (HIRE). HIRE dose not solely rely on the pre-defined interaction pattern or the manually constructed heterogeneous information network. Instead, we devise a Heterogeneous Interaction Module (HIM) to jointly model the heterogeneous interactions and directly infer the important interactions via the observed data. In the experiments, we evaluate our model under three cold-start settings on three real-world datasets. The experimental results show that HIRE outperforms other baselines by a large margin. Furthermore, we visualize the inferred interactions of HIRE to confirm the contribution of our model.</p>

Many researchers have made attempts to study abstract art in the form of edge detection, brush stroke and emotion recognition algorithms using machine and deep learning. This papers describes the study of a wide distribution of abstract paintings using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks(GAN). GANs have the ability to learn and reproduce a distribution enabling researchers and scientists to effectively explore and study the generated image space. However, the challenge lies in developing an efficient GAN architecture that overcomes common training pitfalls. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a modified-DCGAN (mDCGAN) specifically designed for high-quality artwork generation. The approach involves a thorough exploration of the modifications made, delving into the intricate workings of DCGANs, optimisation techniques, and regularisation methods aimed at improving stability and realism in art generation enabling effective study of generated patterns. The proposed mDCGAN incorporates meticulous adjustments in layer configurations and architectural choices, offering tailored solutions to the unique demands of art generation while effectively combating issues like mode collapse and gradient vanishing. Further this paper explores the generated latent space by performing random walks to understand vector relationships between brush strokes and colours in the abstract art space and a statistical analysis of unstable outputs after a certain period of GAN training and compare its significant difference. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, emphasising its potential to revolutionise the field of digital art generation and digital art ecosystem.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zihan Fang, Zheng Lin, Zhe Chen, Xianhao Chen, Yue Gao, Yuguang Fang</p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge in the development of advanced intelligent generative content (AIGC), especially large language models (LLMs). However, for many downstream tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune LLMs using private data. While federated learning offers a promising privacy-preserving solution to LLM fine-tuning, the substantial size of an LLM, combined with high computational and communication demands, makes it hard to apply to downstream tasks. More importantly, private edge servers often possess varying computing and network resources in real-world scenarios, introducing additional complexities to LLM fine-tuning. To tackle these problems, we design and implement an automated federated pipeline, named FedPipe, to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training cost but without adding any inference latency. FedPipe firstly identifies the weights to be fine-tuned based on their contributions to the LLM training. It then configures a low-rank adapter for each selected weight to train local low-rank adapters on an edge server, and aggregate local adapters of all edge servers to fine-tune the whole LLM. Finally, it appropriately quantizes the parameters of LLM to reduce memory space according to the requirements of edge servers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedPipe expedites the model training and achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art benchmarks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ye Liu, Yue Xue, Daoyuan Wu, Yuqiang Sun, Yi Li, Miaolei Shi, Yang Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this paper explores the potential of leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs,such as GPT-4, to transfer existing human-written properties (e.g.,those from Certora auditing reports) and automatically generate customized properties for unknown code. To this end, we embed existing properties into a vector database and retrieve a reference property for LLM-based in-context learning to generate a new property for a given code. While this basic process is relatively straightforward, ensuring that the generated properties are (i) compilable, (ii) appropriate, and (iii) verifiable presents challenges. To address (i), we use the compilation and static analysis feedback as an external oracle to guide LLMs in iteratively revising the generated properties. For (ii), we consider multiple dimensions of similarity to rank the properties and employ a weighted algorithm to identify the top-K properties as the final result. For (iii), we design a dedicated prover to formally verify the correctness of the generated properties. We have implemented these strategies into a novel LLM-based property generation tool called PropertyGPT. Our experiments show that PropertyGPT can generate comprehensive and high-quality properties, achieving an 80% recall compared to the ground truth. It successfully detected 26 CVEs/attack incidents out of 37 tested and also uncovered 12 zero-day vulnerabilities, leading to $8,256 in bug bounty rewards.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiaobin Li, Kai Wu, Yujian Betterest Li, Xiaoyu Zhang, Handing Wang, Jing Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Zero-shot optimization involves optimizing a target task that was not seen during training, aiming to provide the optimal solution without or with minimal adjustments to the optimizer. It is crucial to ensure reliable and robust performance in various applications. Current optimizers often struggle with zero-shot optimization and require intricate hyperparameter tuning to adapt to new tasks. To address this, we propose a Pretrained Optimization Model (POM) that leverages knowledge gained from optimizing diverse tasks, offering efficient solutions to zero-shot optimization through direct application or fine-tuning with few-shot samples. Evaluation on the BBOB benchmark and two robot control tasks demonstrates that POM outperforms state-of-the-art black-box optimization methods, especially for high-dimensional tasks. Fine-tuning POM with a small number of samples and budget yields significant performance improvements. Moreover, POM demonstrates robust generalization across diverse task distributions, dimensions, population sizes, and optimization horizons.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maximilian Beck, Korbinian P\"oppel, Markus Spanring, Andreas Auer, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Michael Kopp, G\"unter Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter</p>
<p>Abstract: In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zhan Su, Fengran Mo, Prayag Tiwari, Benyou Wang, Jian-Yun Nie, Jakob Grue Simonsen</p>
<p>Abstract: In multi-task learning, the conventional approach involves training a model on multiple tasks simultaneously. However, the training signals from different tasks can interfere with one another, potentially leading to \textit{negative transfer}. To mitigate this, we investigate if modular language models can facilitate positive transfer and systematic generalization. Specifically, we propose a novel modular language model (\texttt{TensorPoly}), that balances parameter efficiency with nuanced routing methods. For \textit{modules}, we reparameterize Low-Rank Adaptation (\texttt{LoRA}) by employing an entangled tensor through the use of tensor product operations and name the resulting approach \texttt{TLoRA}. For \textit{routing function}, we tailor two innovative routing functions according to the granularity: \texttt{TensorPoly-I} which directs to each rank within the entangled tensor while \texttt{TensorPoly-II} offers a finer-grained routing approach targeting each order of the entangled tensor. The experimental results from the multi-task T0-benchmark demonstrate that: 1) all modular LMs surpass the corresponding dense approaches, highlighting the potential of modular language models to mitigate negative inference in multi-task learning and deliver superior outcomes. 2) \texttt{TensorPoly-I} achieves higher parameter efficiency in adaptation and outperforms other modular LMs, which shows the potential of our approach in multi-task transfer learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sirui Xie, Zhisheng Xiao, Diederik P Kingma, Tingbo Hou, Ying Nian Wu, Kevin Patrick Murphy, Tim Salimans, Ben Poole, Ruiqi Gao</p>
<p>Abstract: While diffusion models can learn complex distributions, sampling requires a computationally expensive iterative process. Existing distillation methods enable efficient sampling, but have notable limitations, such as performance degradation with very few sampling steps, reliance on training data access, or mode-seeking optimization that may fail to capture the full distribution. We propose EM Distillation (EMD), a maximum likelihood-based approach that distills a diffusion model to a one-step generator model with minimal loss of perceptual quality. Our approach is derived through the lens of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the generator parameters are updated using samples from the joint distribution of the diffusion teacher prior and inferred generator latents. We develop a reparametrized sampling scheme and a noise cancellation technique that together stabilizes the distillation process. We further reveal an interesting connection of our method with existing methods that minimize mode-seeking KL. EMD outperforms existing one-step generative methods in terms of FID scores on ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-128, and compares favorably with prior work on distilling text-to-image diffusion models.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maya Bechler-Speicher, Amir Globerson, Ran Gilad-Bachrach</p>
<p>Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yichi Zhang, Yao Huang, Yitong Sun, Chang Liu, Zhe Zhao, Zhengwei Fang, Yifan Wang, Huanran Chen, Xiao Yang, Xingxing Wei, Hang Su, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu</p>
<p>Abstract: Despite the superior capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, they still face significant trustworthiness challenges. Yet, current literature on the assessment of trustworthy MLLMs remains limited, lacking a holistic evaluation to offer thorough insights into future improvements. In this work, we establish MultiTrust, the first comprehensive and unified benchmark on the trustworthiness of MLLMs across five primary aspects: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. Our benchmark employs a rigorous evaluation strategy that addresses both multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts, encompassing 32 diverse tasks with self-curated datasets. Extensive experiments with 21 modern MLLMs reveal some previously unexplored trustworthiness issues and risks, highlighting the complexities introduced by the multimodality and underscoring the necessity for advanced methodologies to enhance their reliability. For instance, typical proprietary models still struggle with the perception of visually confusing images and are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaking and adversarial attacks; MLLMs are more inclined to disclose privacy in text and reveal ideological and cultural biases even when paired with irrelevant images in inference, indicating that the multimodality amplifies the internal risks from base LLMs. Additionally, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research, aiming to facilitate future advancements in this important field.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sanyam Kapoor, Nate Gruver, Manley Roberts, Katherine Collins, Arka Pal, Umang Bhatt, Adrian Weller, Samuel Dooley, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson</p>
<p>Abstract: When using large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications, we need to know when we can trust their predictions. Some works argue that prompting high-performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Maciej Besta, Florian Scheidl, Lukas Gianinazzi, Grzegorz Kwasniewski, Shachar Klaiman, J\"urgen M\"uller, Torsten Hoefler</p>
<p>Abstract: Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Anoop Cherian, Kuan-Chuan Peng, Suhas Lohit, Joanna Matthiesen, Kevin Smith, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p>
<p>Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant progress in the general-purpose problem solving abilities of large vision and language models (LVLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.; some of these breakthroughs even seem to enable AI models to outperform human abilities in varied tasks that demand higher-order cognitive skills. Are the current large AI models indeed capable of generalized problem solving as humans do? A systematic analysis of AI capabilities for joint vision and text reasoning, however, is missing in the current scientific literature. In this paper, we make an effort towards filling this gap, by evaluating state-of-the-art LVLMs on their mathematical and algorithmic reasoning abilities using visuo-linguistic problems from children's Olympiads. Specifically, we consider problems from the Mathematical Kangaroo (MK) Olympiad, which is a popular international competition targeted at children from grades 1-12, that tests children's deeper mathematical abilities using puzzles that are appropriately gauged to their age and skills. Using the puzzles from MK, we created a dataset, dubbed SMART-840, consisting of 840 problems from years 2020-2024. With our dataset, we analyze LVLMs power on mathematical reasoning; their responses on our puzzles offer a direct way to compare against that of children. Our results show that modern LVLMs do demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning skills in solving problems for higher grades, but lack the foundations to correctly answer problems designed for younger children. Further analysis shows that there is no significant correlation between the reasoning capabilities of AI models and that of young children, and their capabilities appear to be based on a different type of reasoning than the cumulative knowledge that underlies children's mathematics and logic skills.</p>

<p>Abstract: We present a new class of fast polylog-linear algorithms based on the theory of structured matrices (in particular low displacement rank) for integrating tensor fields defined on weighted trees. Several applications of the resulting fast tree-field integrators (FTFIs) are presented, including (a) approximation of graph metrics with tree metrics, (b) graph classification, (c) modeling on meshes, and finally (d) Topological Transformers (TTs) (Choromanski et al., 2022) for images. For Topological Transformers, we propose new relative position encoding (RPE) masking mechanisms with as few as three extra learnable parameters per Transformer layer, leading to 1.0-1.5%+ accuracy gains. Importantly, most of FTFIs are exact methods, thus numerically equivalent to their brute-force counterparts. When applied to graphs with thousands of nodes, those exact algorithms provide 5.7-13x speedups. We also provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our methods.</p>

<h1> replace-cross <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00641">NeuroNAS: A Framework for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Compute-in-Memory Systems using Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture Search</a></h1>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Muhammad Shafique</p>
<p>Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated capabilities for solving diverse machine learning tasks with ultra-low power/energy consumption. To maximize the performance and efficiency of SNN inference, the Compute-in-Memory (CIM) hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) have been employed. However, SNN architectures are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying CIM hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems using a hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). NeuroNAS employs the following key steps: (1) optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, (2) employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, (3) developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and (4) devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art, NeuroNAS with 8bit weight precision quickly finds SNNs that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency speed-ups, 84% energy savings across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200 datasets; while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once. In this manner, NeuroNAS enables efficient design automation in developing energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems for diverse ML-based applications.</p>

<p>Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models has become a blockbuster service in today's AI cloud. A production T2I service typically involves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with various "add-on" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image generation control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on modules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in increased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion decouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate, independently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching, parallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA serving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL) technique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model execution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore, SwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism technique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the state-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction and 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Matthias Freiberger, Peter Kun, Anders Sundnes L{\o}vlie, Sebastian Risi</p>
<p>Abstract: Due to their architecture and how they are trained, artificial neural networks are typically not robust toward pruning or shuffling layers at test time. However, such properties would be desirable for different applications, such as distributed neural network architectures where the order of execution cannot be guaranteed or parts of the network can fail during inference. In this work, we address these issues through a number of training approaches for vision transformers whose most important component is randomizing the execution order of attention modules at training time. With our proposed approaches, vision transformers are capable to adapt to arbitrary layer execution orders at test time assuming one tolerates a reduction (about 20\%) in accuracy at the same model size. We analyse the feature representations of our trained models as well as how each layer contributes to the models prediction based on its position during inference. Our analysis shows that layers learn to contribute differently based on their position in the network. Finally, we layer-prune our models at test time and find that their performance declines gracefully. Code available at https://github.com/matfrei/layershuffle.</p>

<p>Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern very-large-scale integration (VLSI) design highlights the significance of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) technologies. Chip placement is a critical step in the EDA workflow, which positions chip modules on the canvas with the goal of optimizing performance, power, and area (PPA) metrics of final chip designs. Recent advances have demonstrated the great potential of AI-based algorithms in enhancing chip placement. However, due to the lengthy workflow of chip design, the evaluations of these algorithms often focus on intermediate surrogate metrics, which are easy to compute but frequently reveal a substantial misalignment with the end-to-end performance (i.e., the final design PPA). To address this challenge, we introduce ChiPBench, which can effectively facilitate research in chip placement within the AI community. ChiPBench is a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness of existing AI-based chip placement algorithms in improving final design PPA metrics. Specifically, we have gathered 20 circuits from various domains (e.g., CPU, GPU, and microcontrollers). These designs are compiled by executing the workflow from the verilog source code, which preserves necessary physical implementation kits, enabling evaluations for the placement algorithms on their impacts on the final design PPA. We executed six state-of-the-art AI-based chip placement algorithms on these designs and plugged the results of each single-point algorithm into the physical implementation workflow to obtain the final PPA results. Experimental results show that even if intermediate metric of a single-point algorithm is dominant, while the final PPA results are unsatisfactory. We believe that our benchmark will serve as an effective evaluation framework to bridge the gap between academia and industry.</p>

Policymakers, model providers, and researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary steps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. For the top performing models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet), we further investigate performance across 4 agent scaffolds (structed bash, action-only, pseudoterminal, and web search). Without subtask guidance, agents leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, and Claude 3 Opus successfully solved complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve. In comparison, the most difficult task took human teams 24 hours and 54 minutes to solve. All code and data are publicly available at https://cybench.github.io.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Zeyuan Chen, Haiyan Wu, Kaixin Wu, Wei Chen, Mingjie Zhong, Jia Xu, Zhongyi Liu, Wei Zhang</p>
<p>Abstract: Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries. Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance. However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation. Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective. To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs. In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively. Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations. Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects. For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling. Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Y. Arteaga, Thomas B. Sch\"on, Nicolas Pielawski</p>
<p>Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a necessary component when implementing AI in high-risk settings, such as autonomous cars, medicine, or insurances. Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, but they are subject to hallucinations, which may cause serious harm in high-risk settings. Despite their success, LLMs are expensive to train and run: they need a large amount of computations and memory, preventing the use of ensembling methods in practice. In this work, we present a novel method that allows for fast and memory-friendly training of LLM ensembles. We show that the resulting ensembles can detect hallucinations and are a viable approach in practice as only one GPU is needed for training and inference.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yihang Zheng, Bo Li, Zhenghao Lin, Yi Luo, Xuanhe Zhou, Chen Lin, Jinsong Su, Guoliang Li, Shifu Li</p>
<p>Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized QA across various industries, including the database domain. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of different LLMs and their modular components in database QA. To this end, we introduce DQABench, the first comprehensive database QA benchmark for LLMs. DQABench features an innovative LLM-based method to automate the generation, cleaning, and rewriting of evaluation dataset, resulting in over 200,000 QA pairs in English and Chinese, separately. These QA pairs cover a wide range of database-related knowledge extracted from manuals, online communities, and database instances. This inclusion allows for an additional assessment of LLMs' Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Tool Invocation Generation (TIG) capabilities in the database QA task. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive LLM-based database QA testbed DQATestbed. This testbed is highly modular and scalable, with basic and advanced components such as Question Classification Routing (QCR), RAG, TIG, and Prompt Template Engineering (PTE). Moreover, DQABench provides a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that computes various metrics throughout a standardized evaluation process to ensure the accuracy and fairness of the evaluation. We use DQABench to evaluate the database QA capabilities under the proposed testbed comprehensively. The evaluation reveals findings like (i) the strengths and limitations of nine LLM-based QA bots and (ii) the performance impact and potential improvements of various service components (e.g., QCR, RAG, TIG). Our benchmark and findings will guide the future development of LLM-based database QA research.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiao-Tong Zhang, Ding-Cheng Huang, Kamal Youcef-Toumi</p>
<p>Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires the robots to possess human-like intelligence. Inspired by the human's cognitive ability to selectively process and filter elements in complex environments, this paper introduces a novel concept and scene-understanding approach termed `relevance.' It identifies relevant components in a scene. To accurately and efficiently quantify relevance, we developed an event-based framework that selectively triggers relevance determination, along with a probabilistic methodology built on a structured scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the relevance framework and methodology accurately predict the relevance of a general HRC setup, achieving a precision of 0.99 and a recall of 0.94. Relevance can be broadly applied to several areas in HRC to improve task planning time by 79.56% compared with pure planning for a cereal task, reduce perception latency by up to 26.53% for an object detector, improve HRC safety by up to 13.50% and reduce the number of inquiries for HRC by 80.84%. A real-world demonstration showcases the relevance framework's ability to intelligently assist humans in everyday tasks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is crucial for accurately diagnosing and analyzing various diseases. However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, the most commonly used architectures for this task, struggle to effectively capture long-range dependencies due to the inherent locality of CNNs and the computational complexity of Transformers. To address this limitation, we introduce TTT-Unet, a novel framework that integrates Test-Time Training (TTT) layers into the traditional U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation. TTT-Unet dynamically adjusts model parameters during the testing time, enhancing the model's ability to capture both local and long-range features. We evaluate TTT-Unet on multiple medical imaging datasets, including 3D abdominal organ segmentation in CT and MR images, instrument segmentation in endoscopy images, and cell segmentation in microscopy images. The results demonstrate that TTT-Unet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based segmentation models across all tasks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jingyuan Wang, Jie Zhang, Shihao Chen, Miao Sun</p>
<p>Abstract: Binaural speech enhancement (BSE) aims to jointly improve the speech quality and intelligibility of noisy signals received by hearing devices and preserve the spatial cues of the target for natural listening. Existing methods often suffer from the compromise between noise reduction (NR) capacity and spatial cues preservation (SCP) accuracy and a high computational demand in complex acoustic scenes. In this work, we present a learning-based lightweight binaural complex convolutional network (LBCCN), which excels in NR by filtering low-frequency bands and keeping the rest. Additionally, our approach explicitly incorporates the estimation of interchannel relative acoustic transfer function to ensure the spatial cues fidelity and speech clarity. Results show that the proposed LBCCN can achieve a comparable NR performance to state-of-the-art methods under various noise conditions, but with a much lower computational cost and a better SCP.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Rosemary Y. He, Jeffrey N. Chiang</p>
<p>Abstract: Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Raja Kumar, Raghav Singhal, Pranamya Kulkarni, Deval Mehta, Kshitij Jadhav</p>
<p>Abstract: Deep multimodal learning has shown remarkable success by leveraging contrastive learning to capture explicit one-to-one relations across modalities. However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.

<p>Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels. Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is possible and effective.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Sungduk Yu, Man Luo, Avinash Madasu, Vasudev Lal, Phillip Howard</p>
<p>Abstract: Peer review is a critical process for ensuring the integrity of published scientific research. Confidence in this process is predicated on the assumption that experts in the relevant domain give careful consideration to the merits of manuscripts which are submitted for publication. With the recent rapid advancements in the linguistic capabilities of large language models (LLMs), a new potential risk to the peer review process is that negligent reviewers will rely on LLMs to perform the often time consuming process of reviewing a paper. In this study, we investigate the ability of existing AI text detection algorithms to distinguish between peer reviews written by humans and different state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that existing approaches fail to identify many GPT-4o written reviews without also producing a high number of false positive classifications. To address this deficiency, we propose a new detection approach which surpasses existing methods in the identification of GPT-4o written peer reviews at low levels of false positive classifications. Our work reveals the difficulty of accurately identifying AI-generated text at the individual review level, highlighting the urgent need for new tools and methods to detect this type of unethical application of generative AI.</p>

Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.</p>

<p>Abstract: Prior methods propose to offset the escalating costs of modern foundation models by dropping specific parts of their contexts with hand-designed rules, while attempting to preserve their original performance. We overcome this trade-off with Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs), introducing a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. We evolve NAMMs atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs are universally applicable to any model using self-attention as they condition exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices. Learning NAMMs on a small set of problems, we achieve substantial performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks while cutting the model's input contexts up to a fraction of the original sizes. We show the generality of our conditioning enables zero-shot transfer of NAMMs trained only on language to entirely new transformer architectures even across input modalities, with their benefits carrying over to vision and reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Mohamed Elsayed, Gautham Vasan, A. Rupam Mahmood</p>
<p>Abstract: Natural intelligence processes experience as a continuous stream, sensing, acting, and learning moment-by-moment in real time. Streaming learning, the modus operandi of classic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like Q-learning and TD, mimics natural learning by using the most recent sample without storing it. This approach is also ideal for resource-constrained, communication-limited, and privacy-sensitive applications. However, in deep RL, learners almost always use batch updates and replay buffers, making them computationally expensive and incompatible with streaming learning. Although the prevalence of batch deep RL is often attributed to its sample efficiency, a more critical reason for the absence of streaming deep RL is its frequent instability and failure to learn, which we refer to as stream barrier. This paper introduces the stream-x algorithms, the first class of deep RL algorithms to overcome stream barrier for both prediction and control and match sample efficiency of batch RL. Through experiments in Mujoco Gym, DM Control Suite, and Atari Games, we demonstrate stream barrier in existing algorithms and successful stable learning with our stream-x algorithms: stream Q, stream AC, and stream TD, achieving the best model-free performance in DM Control Dog environments. A set of common techniques underlies the stream-x algorithms, enabling their success with a single set of hyperparameters and allowing for easy extension to other algorithms, thereby reviving streaming RL.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Max Wilcoxson, Qiyang Li, Kevin Frans, Sergey Levine</p>
<p>Abstract: Unsupervised pretraining has been transformative in many supervised domains. However, applying such ideas to reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in that fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data, but rather exploring and locating the solution through iterative self-improvement. In this work, we study how unlabeled prior trajectory data can be leveraged to learn efficient exploration strategies. While prior data can be used to pretrain a set of low-level skills, or as additional off-policy data for online RL, it has been unclear how to combine these ideas effectively for online exploration. Our method SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration) demonstrates that a careful combination of these ideas compounds their benefits. Our method first extracts low-level skills using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and then pseudo-relabels unlabeled trajectories using an optimistic reward model, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. We empirically show that SUPE reliably outperforms prior strategies, successfully solving a suite of long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Code: https://github.com/rail-berkeley/supe.</p>

<p>Abstract: We introduce GameGen-X, the first diffusion transformer model specifically designed for both generating and interactively controlling open-world game videos. This model facilitates high-quality, open-domain generation by simulating an extensive array of game engine features, such as innovative characters, dynamic environments, complex actions, and diverse events. Additionally, it provides interactive controllability, predicting and altering future content based on the current clip, thus allowing for gameplay simulation. To realize this vision, we first collected and built an Open-World Video Game Dataset from scratch. It is the first and largest dataset for open-world game video generation and control, which comprises over a million diverse gameplay video clips sampling from over 150 games with informative captions from GPT-4o. GameGen-X undergoes a two-stage training process, consisting of foundation model pre-training and instruction tuning. Firstly, the model was pre-trained via text-to-video generation and video continuation, endowing it with the capability for long-sequence, high-quality open-domain game video generation. Further, to achieve interactive controllability, we designed InstructNet to incorporate game-related multi-modal control signal experts. This allows the model to adjust latent representations based on user inputs, unifying character interaction and scene content control for the first time in video generation. During instruction tuning, only the InstructNet is updated while the pre-trained foundation model is frozen, enabling the integration of interactive controllability without loss of diversity and quality of generated video content.</p>

<p>Abstract: While 3D generative models have greatly improved artists' workflows, the existing diffusion models for 3D generation suffer from slow generation and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D-1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation. In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. Our framework involves the text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Xiayang Xiao, Zhuoxuan Li, Ruyi Zhang, Jiacheng Chen, Haipeng Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: The limitations of existing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) methods lie in their confinement by the closed-environment assumption, hindering their effective and robust handling of unknown target categories in open environments. Open Set Recognition (OSR), a pivotal facet for algorithmic practicality, intends to categorize known classes while denoting unknown ones as "unknown." The chief challenge in OSR involves concurrently mitigating risks associated with generalizing features from a restricted set of known classes to numerous unknown samples and the open space exposure to potential unknown data. To enhance open-set SAR classification, a method called scattering kernel with reciprocal learning network is proposed. Initially, a feature learning framework is constructed based on reciprocal point learning (RPL), establishing a bounded space for potential unknown classes. This approach indirectly introduces unknown information into a learner confined to known classes, thereby acquiring more concise and discriminative representations. Subsequently, considering the variability in the imaging of targets at different angles and the discreteness of components in SAR images, a proposal is made to design convolutional kernels based on large-sized attribute scattering center models. This enhances the ability to extract intrinsic non-linear features and specific scattering characteristics in SAR images, thereby improving the discriminative features of the model and mitigating the impact of imaging variations on classification performance. Experiments on the MSTAR datasets substantiate the superior performance of the proposed approach called ASC-RPL over mainstream methods.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Wang Yu, Wei Wei</p>
<p>Abstract: Recognition of low-quality face images remains a challenge due to invisible or deformation in partial facial regions. For low-quality images dominated by missing partial facial regions, local region similarity contributes more to face recognition (FR). Conversely, in cases dominated by local face deformation, excessive attention to local regions may lead to misjudgments, while global features exhibit better robustness. However, most of the existing FR methods neglect the bias in feature quality of low-quality images introduced by different factors. To address this issue, we propose a Local and Global Feature Attention Fusion (LGAF) network based on feature quality. The network adaptively allocates attention between local and global features according to feature quality and obtains more discriminative and high-quality face features through local and global information complementarity. In addition, to effectively obtain fine-grained information at various scales and increase the separability of facial features in high-dimensional space, we introduce a Multi-Head Multi-Scale Local Feature Extraction (MHMS) module. Experimental results demonstrate that the LGAF achieves the best average performance on $4$ validation sets (CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB, and CALFW), and the performance on TinyFace and SCFace outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (SoTA).</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Jun Chen, Dannong Xu, Junjie Fei, Chun-Mei Feng, Mohamed Elhoseiny</p>
<p>Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet they face limitations in real-world applications requiring complex reasoning over a large number of images. Existing benchmarks for multi-image question-answering are limited in scope, each question is paired with only up to 30 images, which does not fully capture the demands of large-scale retrieval tasks encountered in the real-world usages. To reduce these gaps, we introduce two document haystack benchmarks, dubbed DocHaystack and InfoHaystack, designed to evaluate LMM performance on large-scale visual document retrieval and understanding. Additionally, we propose V-RAG, a novel, vision-centric retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a suite of multimodal vision encoders, each optimized for specific strengths, and a dedicated question-document relevance module. V-RAG sets a new standard, with a 9% and 11% improvement in Recall@1 on the challenging DocHaystack-1000 and InfoHaystack-1000 benchmarks, respectively, compared to the previous best baseline models. Additionally, integrating V-RAG with LMMs enables them to efficiently operate across thousands of images, yielding significant improvements on our DocHaystack and InfoHaystack benchmarks.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Erin Carson, Xinye Chen, Cheng Kang</p>
<p>Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Ching-Yi Wang</p>
<p>Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, excel at integrating text and visual data but face systematic challenges when interpreting ambiguous or incomplete visual stimuli. This study leverages statistical modeling to analyze the factors driving these errors, using a dataset of geometric stimuli characterized by features like 3D, rotation, and missing face/side. We applied parametric methods, non-parametric methods, and ensemble techniques to predict classification errors, with the non-linear gradient boosting model achieving the highest performance (AUC=0.85) during cross-validation. Feature importance analysis highlighted difficulties in depth perception and reconstructing incomplete structures as key contributors to misclassification. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of statistical approaches for uncovering limitations in MLLMs and offer actionable insights for enhancing model architectures by integrating contextual reasoning mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Libin Liu, Shen Chen, Sen Jia, Jingzhe Shi, Zhongyu Jiang, Can Jin, Wu Zongkai, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Lei Li</p>
<p>Abstract: Spatial intelligence is foundational to AI systems that interact with the physical world, particularly in 3D scene generation and spatial comprehension. Current methodologies for 3D scene generation often rely heavily on predefined datasets, and struggle to adapt dynamically to changing spatial relationships. In this paper, we introduce GraphCanvas3D, a programmable, extensible, and adaptable framework for controllable 3D scene generation. Leveraging in-context learning, GraphCanvas3D enables dynamic adaptability without the need for retraining, supporting flexible and customizable scene creation. Our framework employs hierarchical, graph-driven scene descriptions, representing spatial elements as graph nodes and establishing coherent relationships among objects in 3D environments. Unlike conventional approaches, which are constrained in adaptability and often require predefined input masks or retraining for modifications, GraphCanvas3D allows for seamless object manipulation and scene adjustments on the fly. Additionally, GraphCanvas3D supports 4D scene generation, incorporating temporal dynamics to model changes over time. Experimental results and user studies demonstrate that GraphCanvas3D enhances usability, flexibility, and adaptability for scene generation.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Shanu Kumar, Saish Mendke, Karody Lubna Abdul Rahman, Santosh Kurasa, Parag Agrawal, Sandipan Dandapat</p>
<p>Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the capability of large language models (LLMs) by structuring their reasoning processes. However, existing methods face critical limitations: handcrafted demonstrations require extensive human expertise, while trigger phrases are prone to inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose the Zero-shot Uncertainty-based Selection (ZEUS) method, a novel approach that improves CoT prompting by utilizing uncertainty estimates to select effective demonstrations without needing access to model parameters. Unlike traditional methods, ZEUS offers high sensitivity in distinguishing between helpful and ineffective questions, ensuring more precise and reliable selection. Our extensive evaluation shows that ZEUS consistently outperforms existing CoT strategies across four challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and scalability.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Marcel Torne, Arhan Jain, Jiayi Yuan, Vidaaranya Macha, Lars Ankile, Anthony Simeonov, Pulkit Agrawal, Abhishek Gupta</p>
<p>Abstract: Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any additional human effort.

<p><b>Authors:</b> Weishun Zhong, Tankut Can, Antonis Georgiou, Ilya Shnayderman, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks</p>
<p>Abstract: Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Youquan Xian, Xueying Zeng, Duancheng Xuan, Danping Yang, Chunpei Li, Peng Fan, Peng Liu</p>
<p>Abstract: Blockchain smart contracts have catalyzed the development of decentralized applications across various domains, including decentralized finance. However, due to constraints in computational resources and the prevalence of data silos, current smart contracts face significant challenges in fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as intelligent analysis and reasoning. To address this gap, this paper proposes and implements a universal framework for integrating LLMs with blockchain data, {\sysname}, effectively overcoming the interoperability barriers between blockchain and LLMs. By combining semantic relatedness with truth discovery methods, we introduce an innovative data aggregation approach, {\funcname}, which significantly enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of data generated by LLMs. To validate the framework's effectiveness, we construct a dataset consisting of three types of questions, capturing Q\&A interactions between 10 oracle nodes and 5 LLM models. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with 40\% malicious nodes, the proposed solution improves data accuracy by an average of 17.74\% compared to the optimal baseline. This research not only provides an innovative solution for the intelligent enhancement of smart contracts but also highlights the potential for deep integration between LLMs and blockchain technology, paving the way for more intelligent and complex applications of smart contracts in the future.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Trung-Anh Dang, Vincent Nguyen, Ngoc-Son Vu, Christel Vrain</p>
<p>Abstract: Contrastive learning has significantly improved representation quality, enhancing knowledge transfer across tasks in continual learning (CL). However, catastrophic forgetting remains a key challenge, as contrastive based methods primarily focus on "soft relationships" or "softness" between samples, which shift with changing data distributions and lead to representation overlap across tasks. Recently, the newly identified Neural Collapse phenomenon has shown promise in CL by focusing on "hard relationships" or "hardness" between samples and fixed prototypes. However, this approach overlooks "softness", crucial for capturing intra-class variability, and this rigid focus can also pull old class representations toward current ones, increasing forgetting. Building on these insights, we propose Focal Neural Collapse Contrastive (FNC^2), a novel representation learning loss that effectively balances both soft and hard relationships. Additionally, we introduce the Hardness-Softness Distillation (HSD) loss to progressively preserve the knowledge gained from these relationships across tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in minimizing memory reliance. Remarkably, even without the use of memory, our approach rivals rehearsal-based methods, offering a compelling solution for data privacy concerns.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Konstantin Chernyshev, Vitaliy Polshkov, Ekaterina Artemova, Alex Myasnikov, Vlad Stepanov, Alexei Miasnikov, Sergei Tilga</p>
<p>Abstract: The current evaluation of mathematical skills in LLMs is limited, as existing benchmarks are either relatively small, primarily focus on elementary and high-school problems, or lack diversity in topics. Additionally, the inclusion of visual elements in tasks remains largely under-explored.
  To address these gaps, we introduce U-MATH, a novel benchmark of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials. It is balanced across six core subjects, with 20% of multimodal problems. Given the open-ended nature of U-MATH problems, we employ an LLM to judge the correctness of generated solutions. To this end, we release $\mu$-MATH, a dataset to evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in judging solutions.
  The evaluation of general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs highlights the challenges presented by U-MATH. Our findings reveal that LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of only 63% on text-based tasks, with even lower 45% on visual problems. The solution assessment proves challenging for LLMs, with the best LLM judge having an F1-score of 80% on $\mu$-MATH.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Nefeli Andreou, Varsha Vivek, Ying Wang, Alex Vorobiov, Tiffany Deng, Raja Bala, Larry Davis, Betty Mohler Tesch</p>
<p>Abstract: Accurately generating images of human bodies from text remains a challenging problem for state of the art text-to-image models. Commonly observed body-related artifacts include extra or missing limbs, unrealistic poses, blurred body parts, etc. Currently, evaluation of such artifacts relies heavily on time-consuming human judgments, limiting the ability to benchmark models at scale. We address this by proposing BodyMetric, a learnable metric that predicts body realism in images. BodyMetric is trained on realism labels and multi-modal signals including 3D body representations inferred from the input image, and textual descriptions. In order to facilitate this approach, we design an annotation pipeline to collect expert ratings on human body realism leading to a new dataset for this task, namely, BodyRealism. Ablation studies support our architectural choices for BodyMetric and the importance of leveraging a 3D human body prior in capturing body-related artifacts in 2D images. In comparison to concurrent metrics which evaluate general user preference in images, BodyMetric specifically reflects body-related artifacts. We demonstrate the utility of BodyMetric through applications that were previously infeasible at scale. In particular, we use BodyMetric to benchmark the generation ability of text-to-image models to produce realistic human bodies. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of BodyMetric in ranking generated images based on the predicted realism scores.</p>

<p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of generating creative outputs are reshaping our understanding of creativity. This shift presents an opportunity for creativity researchers to reevaluate the key components of the creative process. In particular, the advanced capabilities of AI underscore the importance of studying the internal processes of creativity. This paper explores the neurobiological machinery that underlies these internal processes and describes the experiential component of creativity. It is concluded that although the products of artificial and human creativity can be similar, the internal processes are different. The paper also discusses how AI may negatively affect the internal processes of human creativity, such as the development of skills, the integration of knowledge, and the diversity of ideas.</p>

<p><b>Authors:</b> Yuqi Wu, Wenzhao Zheng, Sicheng Zuo, Yuanhui Huang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
<p>Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents which demands to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through the local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Experiments demonstrate that our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing local prediction methods and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and strong expandability.

<p>Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an important task for robust vision-centric autonomous driving, which predicts fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene. Most existing methods leverage dense grid-based scene representations, overlooking the spatial sparsity of the driving scenes. Although 3D semantic Gaussian serves as an object-centric sparse alternative, most of the Gaussians still describe the empty region with low efficiency. To address this, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian superposition model which interprets each Gaussian as a probability distribution of its neighborhood being occupied and conforms to probabilistic multiplication to derive the overall geometry. Furthermore, we adopt the exact Gaussian mixture model for semantics calculation to avoid unnecessary overlapping of Gaussians. To effectively initialize Gaussians in non-empty region, we design a distribution-based initialization module which learns the pixel-aligned occupancy distribution instead of the depth of surfaces. We conduct extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets and our GaussianFormer-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.
